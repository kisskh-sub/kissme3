Security.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.810
I'm from Jun An. Jun An Law Firm.

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.530
There are suspicious noises
in our hallway.

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:42.769
Come check it out.

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:44.130
We're off duty.

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:46.010
Don't you have staff on duty?

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:34.769
Yan Fei?

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.530
Look at the state you're in.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.530
No one would guess
you're Xingke's heiress.

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:47.570
Are you an alcoholic?

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:49.649
I've seen you drinking many times.

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.970
You usually seem so polished and mature.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.130
How come you're so timid?

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:56.929
I am timid?

00:03:58.169 --> 00:03:59.209
What if burglars break in?

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.489
The documents at Jun An

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:03.370
are all confidential.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.169
Understood.

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:06.489
It's fine.

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.010
If there are intruders,
I'll protect you. I'm brave.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.010
Didn't you submit your report?
It's almost midnight.

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.769
Why are you here?

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:16.969
What happened?

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:17.849
Mr. Zhou.

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:20.329
You're so kind

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:21.409
and righteous.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.209
Don't pretend you didn't notice

00:04:24.209 --> 00:04:25.730
I cheated and got outside help.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.529
I promised I would never

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:30.649
rely on my family.

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:32.969
But today, I still asked my brother

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:35.409
and his friends for help.
So I don't want to go home.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:39.329
I want to win.

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:42.089
My current ranking is low.

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:43.730
So I want to create

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.409
an irresistible proposal for Warm Nest.

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:46.449
Also,

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.649
I don't want Warm Nest to hold Jun An,

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.130
Jiang Chen, or you accountable.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.730
I don't want you
and your girlfriend to break up.

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:54.922
- I want to help you.
- Help me?

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:56.329
Listen,

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:57.810
don't misunderstand.

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.050
It's just that I think

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:02.570
affectionate men aren't rare.

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.289
But devoted and principled

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:05.849
male lawyers like you

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:06.849
are exceptionally rare.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.449
I just wanted

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:10.289
to protect endangered species.

00:05:12.329 --> 00:05:14.209
I'm not as exceptional as you claim.

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.810
Yan Fei.

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:18.216
Thank you.

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:21.969
When you first joined Jun An,

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:24.289
I was biased toward you.

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.810
I was wrong.

00:05:26.769 --> 00:05:27.490
Biased toward me?

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:28.610
Why?

00:05:29.649 --> 00:05:31.610
Because my family kept calling the firm.

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:34.130
I was wrong.

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.289
After all, none of us can choose

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:38.089
our families.

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:39.370
You didn't choose

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.610
for your family
to be Jun An's biggest client.

00:05:42.329 --> 00:05:43.089
But your family

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:44.490
loves you,

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:45.576
right?

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:47.529
Do you truly think so?

00:05:48.209 --> 00:05:49.649
I assumed everyone wanted me

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:51.010
to quickly go through the motions

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.810
and leave.

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:53.370
Nonsense.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:55.144
Okay.

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:56.690
I've confessed to you.

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:58.769
Report this to the senior lawyers.

00:05:59.250 --> 00:05:59.930
I won't mind.

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:05.050
First of all,

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:06.849
you're drunk.

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:09.449
Your words aren't legally binding.

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:12.250
Second, trust Jun An's senior lawyers

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.209
to exercise sound judgment.

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:21.529
By the way,

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.529
shouldn't you be at dinner right now?

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:24.610
Why are you here?

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.010
You couldn't find her?

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:29.289
I found her.

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:33.649
That was

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:35.769
our final dinner together.

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:38.529
She said our time together was precious.

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:40.810
What is past is past.

00:06:42.209 --> 00:06:43.400
She refused to stay together.

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:51.610
Want to drink?

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:12.170
It's funny.

00:07:12.649 --> 00:07:14.490
I was dejected earlier.

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:16.649
But after you scared me,

00:07:17.649 --> 00:07:18.170
I feel okay.

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:21.370
Happy weekend.

00:07:22.849 --> 00:07:24.050
We take a weekend break.

00:07:46.952 --> 00:07:47.821
(Are you okay?)

00:08:17.576 --> 00:08:19.688
(Victim's family information)

00:08:30.792 --> 00:08:34.089
(The financing idea
was indeed inspired by you.)

00:08:34.089 --> 00:08:36.233
(But I did the concrete work.)

00:08:36.233 --> 00:08:37.883
(Hope you won't be mad at me.)

00:08:37.883 --> 00:08:38.985
(Thanks for the porridge.)

00:08:38.985 --> 00:08:40.296
(Accept the transferred money.)

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:47.649
Can you handle it?

00:08:47.769 --> 00:08:51.889
- Should I have your family get you?
- I'm almost home.

00:08:51.889 --> 00:08:52.809
Keep your voice down.

00:08:52.809 --> 00:08:53.970
Don't let my brother hear.

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:56.809
Thank you

00:08:59.529 --> 00:09:00.610
for today.

00:09:01.569 --> 00:09:02.289
Don't mention it.

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:05.529
Don't lose heart.

00:09:05.929 --> 00:09:08.210
All the sad things will pass.

00:09:08.929 --> 00:09:09.850
Tomorrow

00:09:10.409 --> 00:09:12.289
will be a wonderful day.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:13.850
Tomorrow?

00:09:15.409 --> 00:09:16.040
What?

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:16.730
It's fine.

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:17.850
Be careful!

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:18.450
- Okay.
- Head back.

00:09:18.649 --> 00:09:20.689
Bye! See you tomorrow.

00:09:31.569 --> 00:09:33.649
Mr. Yan. He is Zhou Nian,

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:35.370
a fourth-year lawyer at Jun An,

00:09:35.809 --> 00:09:37.809
also the mentor
for the Talent Hunt Program.

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:42.809
Another lawyer.

00:09:43.169 --> 00:09:43.688
Yeah.

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:45.649
When Fei first joined Jun An,

00:09:45.889 --> 00:09:47.090
I specifically called him.

00:09:47.649 --> 00:09:50.370
He is quite clever.
He never presses Fei.

00:09:59.529 --> 00:10:00.040
Drive.

00:10:26.289 --> 00:10:27.809
Mr. Zhou, cheers! Drink up!

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:38.769
Yan Da, what's wrong with you?

00:10:39.169 --> 00:10:40.409
How come you got so drunk?

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:42.049
Who did you drink with?

00:10:42.569 --> 00:10:43.450
None of your business!

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:01.512
Hello?

00:11:02.409 --> 00:11:03.569
That young lawyer...

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:04.689
Mr. Yan.

00:11:04.689 --> 00:11:05.809
Should I talk with him?

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:08.649
Sure, do it first.

00:11:09.529 --> 00:11:10.490
Check his background.

00:11:12.169 --> 00:11:14.289
Even though Fei will leave Jun An soon,

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:17.330
she shouldn't associate
with questionable people.

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:17.850
Understood.

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:33.569
What's wrong?

00:11:36.769 --> 00:11:37.529
What is it, Auntie?

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:43.769
My cousin is coming back?

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:45.130
Did you two argue again?

00:11:46.569 --> 00:11:47.649
I don't care.

00:11:49.689 --> 00:11:51.049
She's been abroad for years.

00:11:51.769 --> 00:11:52.929
She never came back once.

00:11:54.649 --> 00:11:55.970
She must've forgotten about me.

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:01.090
You are the same. You're ungrateful too.

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:03.130
Can't you understand your mom?

00:12:04.289 --> 00:12:06.130
Was she wrong
to ask you to live with your dad?

00:12:06.169 --> 00:12:07.169
She only cares about you.

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:10.889
You think she's after some money?

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:12.744
You think...

00:12:16.169 --> 00:12:17.409
Forget it. I won't say more.

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:19.610
Mothers are often blamed,

00:12:20.289 --> 00:12:21.409
regardless of what they do.

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:27.850
I know she has it hard.

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:29.970
So do you.

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:31.409
I understand.

00:12:35.049 --> 00:12:35.850
Well,

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:38.610
you're more sensible than your cousin.

00:12:39.649 --> 00:12:41.130
If only she were like you,

00:12:41.649 --> 00:12:43.450
willing to come back
and build a life here.

00:12:45.769 --> 00:12:46.330
How about

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:48.689
you talk to her sometime?

00:12:50.769 --> 00:12:51.368
Okay.

00:12:56.008 --> 00:12:58.637
(The points and rankings for this round
will be announced tomorrow morning.)

00:12:58.637 --> 00:13:00.301
(All Talent Hunt Program candidates,)

00:13:00.301 --> 00:13:02.664
(gather in the multi-function hall
at 2 PM.)

00:13:03.976 --> 00:13:06.024
(From: Talent Hunt Program work group)

00:14:02.689 --> 00:14:03.529
For this round,

00:14:03.569 --> 00:14:04.649
you all performed well.

00:14:05.169 --> 00:14:06.490
I know after spending some time

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:08.569
together, your team spirit soared.

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:11.289
I've also heard you get along well
outside work.

00:14:11.769 --> 00:14:13.169
But this program is a competition.

00:14:13.649 --> 00:14:14.344
Therefore,

00:14:14.529 --> 00:14:16.330
scores and rankings still apply.

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:21.330
I'll now announce this round's scores.

00:14:22.569 --> 00:14:23.409
In the 30-point tier,

00:14:24.769 --> 00:14:25.289
two people.

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:27.130
Yan Fei.

00:14:27.889 --> 00:14:28.490
Ren Jiatong.

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:32.689
In the 20-point tier, two people.

00:14:33.769 --> 00:14:34.440
Guo Xiaoyu.

00:14:35.689 --> 00:14:36.264
Huang Yue.

00:14:37.529 --> 00:14:39.809
In the 10-point tier, one person.

00:14:42.569 --> 00:14:43.112
Li Ke.

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:49.730
Jiang Chen.

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:52.409
The reason you scored zero this round

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:53.490
is clear to you, right?

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:02.632
Ms. Bai.

00:15:02.929 --> 00:15:03.496
Mr. Zhou.

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:04.490
For this round,

00:15:04.809 --> 00:15:05.352
Jiang Chen

00:15:05.809 --> 00:15:07.289
and I are at the bottom.

00:15:07.529 --> 00:15:08.040
Then...

00:15:09.929 --> 00:15:10.569
Listen,

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:13.649
after discussions among the mentors,

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:18.610
the third-round assessment
has no eliminations.

00:15:20.409 --> 00:15:22.289
Everyone performed well these two weeks.

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.049
You all advance to the next round.

00:15:35.889 --> 00:15:36.392
Alright.

00:15:36.929 --> 00:15:39.049
Only 20 minutes to celebrate.

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:41.090
Then go back to work immediately.

00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:43.049
(Huang Yue: I'm staying this month.)
Though no one is eliminated this round,

00:15:43.169 --> 00:15:44.649
the next round will have cuts.

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:46.769
(You withdrew a message.)
Two people might be eliminated.

00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:48.529
Be mentally prepared.

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:52.850
Ms. Bai, you're scaring us again.

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:54.610
Sounds like I'm joking?

00:16:09.929 --> 00:16:10.970
Awesome!

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:14.984
(Talent Hunt Program Candidates
Ranking, Assessment of Round 3)

00:16:15.112 --> 00:16:16.264
(First place: Ren Jiatong, points
of current round: 30, total points: 65)

00:16:16.264 --> 00:16:16.840
(Second place: Yan Fei, points
of current round: 30, total points: 60)

00:16:16.872 --> 00:16:17.512
(Third place: Guo Xiaoyu, points

00:16:17.512 --> 00:16:18.184
(Huang Yue, points
of current round: 20, total points: 45)

00:16:18.184 --> 00:16:18.792
(Li Ke, points
of current round: 10, total points: 40)

00:16:18.792 --> 00:16:19.400
(Jiang Chen, points
of current round: 0, total points: 40)

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:19.944
(Eliminated: Wang Lu)

00:16:20.049 --> 00:16:20.569
This place

00:16:20.809 --> 00:16:22.929
is perfect for group dinners.

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:23.688
What?

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:33.224
(Ren Jiatong: Feeling down
for being last?)

00:16:33.224 --> 00:16:35.720
(Ren Jiatong: Smile,
and try harder next time.)

00:16:42.216 --> 00:16:44.409
(Jiang Chen: It's no big deal.
I'll make up the points next time.)

00:16:44.409 --> 00:16:45.529
If we still haven't decided

00:16:45.529 --> 00:16:46.850
where to go by now,

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:47.929
we should just head home.

00:16:48.689 --> 00:16:49.370
No.

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:50.024
Jiang Chen.

00:16:52.569 --> 00:16:53.529
I'm good with anything.

00:16:53.649 --> 00:16:54.490
I'll follow you.

00:16:55.889 --> 00:16:56.649
Jiatong, and you?

00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.720
(Jiang Chen: What do you say?
Joining them?)

00:17:00.809 --> 00:17:01.490
I'm okay.

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:04.690
Murder mystery?

00:17:07.609 --> 00:17:08.170
Karaoke?

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:12.776
Escape room?

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:13.529
What do you say?

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:14.650
A new one just opened

00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:15.609
right next to our firm.

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:17.450
I've had it bookmarked for long.

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:19.329
(My older guy: Come home early tonight.)
Let me find it.

00:17:22.809 --> 00:17:24.490
Yue, will you go to escape room?

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:28.776
Yes!

00:17:29.529 --> 00:17:30.890
It's a big day.

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:31.809
We must celebrate.

00:17:32.809 --> 00:17:34.170
Today, I'm determined

00:17:34.369 --> 00:17:36.289
to have real fun with you.

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:37.650
Why does it

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:39.089
sound like a farewell speech?

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:41.369
Don't be emotional.

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:43.529
I promise if I find something fun,

00:17:43.529 --> 00:17:44.769
you'll be the first I invite.

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:45.768
Deal.

00:17:49.329 --> 00:17:49.960
Mr. Zhou,

00:17:50.289 --> 00:17:51.529
are you free tonight?

00:17:51.529 --> 00:17:52.650
How about you join us?

00:17:53.369 --> 00:17:54.049
I'll pass.

00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:56.289
I've been focusing on my health lately.

00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:57.490
Since mentoring you all,

00:17:57.609 --> 00:17:59.450
I've got butterflies

00:17:59.529 --> 00:18:00.289
in my stomach.

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:02.809
Let's safeguard your health

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:04.450
together.

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:12.410
Fei, are you coming?

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:15.010
I'll pass.

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:15.930
Have fun.

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:20.210
I thought you loved escape rooms?

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:35.336
Congratulations.

00:18:38.849 --> 00:18:39.609
On what?

00:18:40.329 --> 00:18:42.730
On scraping second place

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:44.609
by using resources of my family

00:18:45.369 --> 00:18:46.529
and professional investors?

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:50.089
- You care so much about rankings?
- Absolutely.

00:18:51.089 --> 00:18:51.930
My scores aren't bad.

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:53.129
I'm excellent.

00:18:53.369 --> 00:18:54.210
Why should I lose?

00:18:56.089 --> 00:18:56.809
I always thought

00:18:56.809 --> 00:18:58.609
people ignored my abilities

00:18:58.609 --> 00:18:59.976
because of my family background.

00:19:00.609 --> 00:19:02.490
But at Jun An,

00:19:03.049 --> 00:19:04.410
I've never ranked first.

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:06.210
Even my overall score now

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:07.450
is lower than Ren Jiatong's.

00:19:09.569 --> 00:19:10.089
Relax.

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:13.529
A pretty girl like you

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:16.210
shouldn't obsess over rankings.

00:19:18.369 --> 00:19:19.010
Mr. Zhou,

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:20.970
I'm not some little girl.

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:24.200
I'm sorry.

00:19:26.769 --> 00:19:28.010
It's just that nowadays,

00:19:28.609 --> 00:19:30.369
those with better options

00:19:31.769 --> 00:19:34.049
don't need such a tough path.

00:19:35.529 --> 00:19:36.289
But if this path

00:19:36.289 --> 00:19:37.769
is truly your choice,

00:19:39.289 --> 00:19:41.529
don't let minor setbacks discourage you

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:43.170
and make you quit early.

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:46.089
This industry shatters the fragile ones.

00:19:47.089 --> 00:19:48.690
You look down on me too, don't you?

00:19:49.129 --> 00:19:49.809
No, I don't.

00:19:51.529 --> 00:19:52.809
As your mentor,

00:19:54.289 --> 00:19:55.529
I think you're outstanding.

00:19:56.809 --> 00:19:58.490
You've put in genuine hard work.

00:19:59.129 --> 00:20:00.648
You said you never worked overtime,

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:01.529
but the jobs

00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:03.289
given to you

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:05.650
were done
by putting in extra hours after work.

00:20:07.129 --> 00:20:09.992
So why would just the ranking
of one round make you question yourself?

00:20:11.329 --> 00:20:12.552
With a good family background,

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:14.490
you can seek help from professionals.

00:20:15.369 --> 00:20:16.450
Is that a bad thing?

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:18.536
No.

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:21.129
To become a top partner as a lawyer,

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:23.529
resource integration skills
are essential.

00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:25.129
If I had those advantages,

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:27.369
to be serious,

00:20:28.049 --> 00:20:29.529
I'd often ask for help.

00:20:31.609 --> 00:20:33.329
Did you recently

00:20:33.369 --> 00:20:35.089
take some management training courses?

00:20:35.769 --> 00:20:38.010
The carrot and stick approach

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:39.049
is outdated, isn't it?

00:20:40.089 --> 00:20:40.650
Outdated?

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:42.849
Does it work?

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:45.096
Thanks.

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:49.289
However,

00:20:50.569 --> 00:20:52.609
there's still a crucial issue.

00:20:54.529 --> 00:20:55.289
Ask yourself.

00:20:56.329 --> 00:20:57.129
Why did you

00:20:58.369 --> 00:20:59.369
join Jun An?

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:02.529
For better rankings?

00:21:04.049 --> 00:21:05.289
To defy your brother?

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:07.609
Or something else?

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:12.569
Have you truly wanted to be a lawyer?

00:21:14.329 --> 00:21:15.930
If you can't find an answer to this,

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:19.129
it'll be hard for you to stay here.

00:21:44.849 --> 00:21:47.210
The escape room you picked
is horror-themed.

00:21:47.569 --> 00:21:49.250
Non-player characters
will appear anytime.

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:51.329
There are solo missions during the game.

00:21:51.609 --> 00:21:53.690
If anything happens, signal
the camera immediately.

00:21:56.329 --> 00:21:57.490
Horror-themed?

00:21:58.089 --> 00:22:00.104
We booked too late.
It was the only option left.

00:22:01.369 --> 00:22:03.089
Before starting,

00:22:03.089 --> 00:22:05.849
can we check the fire safety equipment
and the emergency exits,

00:22:05.849 --> 00:22:07.690
and eliminate other safety hazards?

00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:10.210
Is this

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:11.730
the liability waiver we'll sign later?

00:22:12.089 --> 00:22:14.329
If I suggest revisions,

00:22:14.329 --> 00:22:15.089
will it be fine?

00:22:17.129 --> 00:22:18.089
Now, I understand

00:22:18.089 --> 00:22:20.168
why service industries
dislike serving lawyers.

00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:21.529
Though I studied law,

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:22.769
I understand.

00:22:23.609 --> 00:22:24.849
This protects both parties.

00:22:25.369 --> 00:22:26.450
As the staff mentioned,

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:28.289
non-player characters
will appear anytime.

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:30.089
If any accident occurred,

00:22:30.329 --> 00:22:31.010
posing a danger,

00:22:31.129 --> 00:22:32.289
who would be to blame?

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:34.210
Jiang Chen, are you rambling

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:35.250
because you're scared?

00:22:35.849 --> 00:22:36.410
Of course not.

00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:38.129
I'm a staunch materialist.

00:22:38.129 --> 00:22:40.049
Supernatural stuff doesn't frighten me.

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:42.450
Then you lead the way.

00:22:42.609 --> 00:22:43.176
No way.

00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:15.569
There's a combination lock.

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:17.089
Shouldn't we

00:23:17.089 --> 00:23:18.529
find clues in this room

00:23:18.569 --> 00:23:19.809
to crack this 4-digit code?

00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:21.129
Then we can get out.

00:23:25.849 --> 00:23:27.089
Who painted this?

00:23:27.329 --> 00:23:28.210
Any clues?

00:23:28.609 --> 00:23:29.129
It's Durer.

00:23:32.049 --> 00:23:33.089
Good.

00:23:33.849 --> 00:23:35.930
You two are all-round students.

00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:38.970
I don't know about art.

00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:40.329
But I know this copyright case.

00:23:40.769 --> 00:23:42.609
His signature was unique.

00:23:42.609 --> 00:23:43.208
Look,

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:44.930
he combined his initials

00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:45.849
into this monogram.

00:23:46.089 --> 00:23:47.849
It attracted many imitators,

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:49.369
so he sued them in court

00:23:49.369 --> 00:23:50.609
to protect his copyright.

00:23:50.809 --> 00:23:52.072
No one dared to imitate again.

00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:55.809
You knew this too?

00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:59.129
I saw the original in New York once.

00:23:59.369 --> 00:24:00.609
It left a deep impression.

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:03.170
Impressive.

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:05.529
This painting seems incomplete.

00:24:12.369 --> 00:24:13.410
What are you doing here?

00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:14.250
I got scared.

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:16.849
This is the Relics Management Office.

00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:18.210
Everyone,

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:20.970
you all look like smart people.

00:24:21.529 --> 00:24:22.120
Come on,

00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:24.450
let's play a game.

00:24:25.049 --> 00:24:26.849
You've got three minutes.

00:24:27.289 --> 00:24:29.529
If you can't get out of here,

00:24:30.049 --> 00:24:31.730
then you'll stay here forever.

00:24:33.129 --> 00:24:34.250
No way!

00:24:34.329 --> 00:24:35.609
We compete at the law firm.

00:24:35.809 --> 00:24:37.609
We'll do it again at an escape room?

00:24:37.849 --> 00:24:39.569
He said
it was a horror-themed escape room,

00:24:39.569 --> 00:24:41.250
but never said
anyone would get eliminated.

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:42.529
So I totally wasted my money!

00:24:42.849 --> 00:24:44.569
Two and a half minutes left!
Find the clues!

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:47.210
One part of the code should be 34.

00:24:47.769 --> 00:24:49.450
Look at this four-by-four grid.

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:50.809
Aren't two numbers missing?

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:52.250
I just calculated.

00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:53.250
Every row and column,

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:55.089
including the diagonals,
all add up to 34.

00:24:55.369 --> 00:24:56.809
So we need to find two numbers

00:24:56.809 --> 00:24:58.609
that meet these conditions to fill in.

00:24:59.129 --> 00:25:00.129
Exactly.

00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:02.170
The two empty spaces are...

00:25:02.849 --> 00:25:04.010
15 and 14.

00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:06.049
That matches the year
the painting was created.

00:25:06.049 --> 00:25:07.690
But the sum is 34.

00:25:08.769 --> 00:25:09.809
So it's a magic square.

00:25:12.529 --> 00:25:14.170
If you're both so good at math,

00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:15.369
why did you study law?

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:16.569
Focus on finding clues!

00:25:17.529 --> 00:25:19.329
One minute left!

00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:23.250
Could it be 42?

00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:25.010
Look at this.

00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:27.129
Isn't it like the treasure map
from The Deer and the Cauldron,

00:25:27.129 --> 00:25:28.328
Sutra of Forty-two Chapters?

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:30.529
Count to see if there are 42 pieces.

00:25:30.769 --> 00:25:32.010
That's such a stretch!

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:33.490
We're almost out of time!

00:25:35.569 --> 00:25:36.450
It is 42.

00:25:37.529 --> 00:25:39.080
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:41.970
The ultimate answer
to life, the universe,

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:43.170
and everything is 42!

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:45.569
Ten seconds left!

00:26:05.089 --> 00:26:05.672
Quick!

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:07.369
Wait for me!

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:10.170
Wait for me!

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:11.112
Wait up!

00:26:12.609 --> 00:26:13.289
Stop!

00:26:13.289 --> 00:26:13.890
Listen,

00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:15.049
your business

00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:16.410
has a safety obligation.

00:26:16.529 --> 00:26:17.369
You're professional,

00:26:17.529 --> 00:26:18.369
but stop scaring me.

00:26:18.369 --> 00:26:19.129
If you do it again,

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:20.089
and anything happens,

00:26:20.089 --> 00:26:24.210
you'll be liable for compensation.

00:27:08.609 --> 00:27:09.170
Again!

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:10.890
It's you again!

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:45.849
You move pretty quickly.

00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:49.329
Don't take advantage of me.

00:27:49.329 --> 00:27:50.210
Why are you here?

00:27:52.809 --> 00:27:53.529
What do you think?

00:27:55.930 --> 00:27:56.809
Unlock me!

00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:05.650
It's fine.

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:06.490
Don't be scared.

00:28:06.730 --> 00:28:07.336
Relax.

00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:08.296
It's fake!

00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:17.089
Are you guys okay?

00:28:24.849 --> 00:28:26.410
- I-I'm handcuffed!
- Let me go!

00:28:26.529 --> 00:28:27.129
I'm handcuffed.

00:28:28.809 --> 00:28:29.369
Let go!

00:28:29.369 --> 00:28:30.250
I can't.

00:28:34.984 --> 00:28:35.624
Try this.

00:28:35.848 --> 00:28:36.369
Yeah!

00:28:36.609 --> 00:28:37.289
From below!

00:28:37.289 --> 00:28:37.896
Well,

00:28:38.049 --> 00:28:39.890
I really can't get out right now.

00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:41.809
Move your hand like this.

00:28:42.089 --> 00:28:43.529
No, yes! Right from the inside!

00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:45.170
What are you doing?

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:00.289
Are they showing PDA?

00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:06.730
So,

00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:07.970
let's go eat?

00:29:10.609 --> 00:29:11.730
I should head back.

00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:13.369
Got some work to finish.

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:14.490
- I'll never come again!
- I've got stuff too.

00:29:14.769 --> 00:29:15.656
I'll go get changed.

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:16.450
- Never come again!
- Everyone's busy, huh?

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:18.609
I'll never come again.

00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:20.690
Never again.

00:29:21.809 --> 00:29:22.450
Never.

00:29:22.609 --> 00:29:23.240
Xiaoyu.

00:29:23.769 --> 00:29:24.849
Don't rush off later.

00:29:25.089 --> 00:29:25.928
I'll buy you dinner.

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:27.170
Pick expensive food.

00:29:28.089 --> 00:29:29.369
Did you strike gold?

00:29:29.849 --> 00:29:30.930
Are you coming or not?

00:29:32.369 --> 00:29:33.049
Sure, why not?

00:29:33.569 --> 00:29:34.890
I don't want to go home anyway.

00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:36.369
What's wrong?

00:29:38.849 --> 00:29:39.490
Go get changed.

00:29:40.529 --> 00:29:41.609
I'll take you somewhere.

00:29:46.089 --> 00:29:48.809
This is the expensive restaurant
you recommend?

00:29:49.609 --> 00:29:50.529
Yeah, of course it is.

00:29:50.529 --> 00:29:51.809
Every time I come to see it,

00:29:51.809 --> 00:29:53.369
I must bring food and drinks.

00:29:53.569 --> 00:29:55.010
And now the treats it eats

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:56.529
cost more than my regular meals.

00:29:57.890 --> 00:29:58.690
Come feel it.

00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:01.129
It's so soft, cuddly, and well-behaved.

00:30:03.049 --> 00:30:04.129
It's adorable.

00:30:05.329 --> 00:30:06.289
Let's eat right here.

00:30:07.809 --> 00:30:09.089
Little puppy,

00:30:09.089 --> 00:30:10.129
go ahead and eat.

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:13.930
There's something I need to tell you.

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:16.170
Oh god, this kind of opening

00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:17.569
usually means bad news.

00:30:18.129 --> 00:30:19.010
Don't be nervous.

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:20.250
This is actually good news.

00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:22.930
At least, I think it's good.

00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:24.529
Definitely not bad news anyway.

00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:25.450
What is it really?

00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:27.089
Did you fight with your boyfriend?

00:30:27.089 --> 00:30:28.890
No, we've been good lately.

00:30:29.809 --> 00:30:30.849
Actually,

00:30:31.049 --> 00:30:32.690
though we used to fight constantly

00:30:32.849 --> 00:30:33.960
and even broke up once,

00:30:34.049 --> 00:30:35.089
I can still feel

00:30:35.089 --> 00:30:36.369
he's always cared about me.

00:30:36.569 --> 00:30:37.650
He's helped me so much too.

00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:39.250
Isn't that great?

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:40.329
That does sound positive.

00:30:41.769 --> 00:30:44.730
But something bothers me.

00:30:46.289 --> 00:30:47.250
Like, he always says

00:30:47.569 --> 00:30:50.049
that even after working at Jun An
for seven or eight years,

00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:51.369
I'd only become

00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:52.890
a slightly better-paid employee.

00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:54.650
He says my annual salary won't

00:30:54.890 --> 00:30:56.809
match his small project's earnings.

00:30:57.129 --> 00:30:57.809
I think

00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:00.450
while we're financially unequal now,

00:31:00.769 --> 00:31:02.250
I'm still working hard.

00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:04.049
He insists

00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:06.129
I should focus my energy on him

00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:08.010
and be more attentive.

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:10.049
He even says that after I marry him,

00:31:10.089 --> 00:31:11.210
I'll have to quit my job

00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:12.730
and focus entirely on our home.

00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:15.410
Otherwise, with both busy,

00:31:15.609 --> 00:31:17.529
having kids would be impossible.

00:31:19.529 --> 00:31:21.529
Why do guys always think like this?

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:22.809
No matter what they earn,

00:31:23.010 --> 00:31:24.089
they ask women

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:25.609
to quit jobs to focus on family.

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:26.529
They never consider

00:31:26.529 --> 00:31:27.890
how insecure that makes us feel.

00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:29.890
If feelings change someday,

00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:31.289
they keep money and careers,

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:32.328
but what do we have?

00:31:32.569 --> 00:31:33.490
Only a child!

00:31:33.569 --> 00:31:34.289
That's unfair!

00:31:36.289 --> 00:31:37.529
Yet I agreed.

00:31:39.650 --> 00:31:41.849
Because he proposed last night.

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:44.250
After all our time together,

00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:46.056
that was his first mention of marriage.

00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:48.170
I honestly thought

00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:50.450
he'd never remarry in his lifetime.

00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:53.410
So his decision for me

00:31:53.769 --> 00:31:54.930
really surprised me.

00:31:55.650 --> 00:31:56.369
So,

00:31:56.369 --> 00:31:57.089
what about Jun An?

00:31:57.369 --> 00:31:58.609
You'd give up this job?

00:31:59.490 --> 00:32:01.369
I'm thrilled
about making the next round.

00:32:01.609 --> 00:32:03.010
I really want to stay at Jun An.

00:32:04.809 --> 00:32:06.010
But marrying him

00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:08.049
is a long-held dream.

00:32:08.569 --> 00:32:09.490
I want to try it.

00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:12.450
I admit it's partly vanity,

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:15.329
but is vanity always wrong?

00:32:15.809 --> 00:32:17.690
I don't steal, just work honestly.

00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:19.129
I marry the one I love

00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:20.650
with a clear conscience.

00:32:21.410 --> 00:32:21.960
Right?

00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:25.809
Since you've thought it through,

00:32:26.849 --> 00:32:27.930
what else can I say?

00:32:29.809 --> 00:32:32.369
You're the only one I've told.

00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:35.170
I need your blessing, Xiaoyu.

00:32:35.609 --> 00:32:36.569
Among our group,

00:32:36.769 --> 00:32:38.369
only you and I are in relationships.

00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:40.129
You understand me, right?

00:32:48.809 --> 00:32:49.730
I wish you happiness.

00:32:51.289 --> 00:32:52.329
I hope you'll be happy.

00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:04.569
Is everyone here?

00:33:06.529 --> 00:33:07.730
Working on the Warm Nest case,

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:08.809
none of us slept well.

00:33:09.129 --> 00:33:11.049
But no one's late on a weekend?

00:33:11.410 --> 00:33:12.450
We wouldn't dare.

00:33:13.129 --> 00:33:13.930
Have some water.

00:33:15.369 --> 00:33:17.129
The community legal outreach

00:33:17.129 --> 00:33:19.089
is a good thing.

00:33:19.369 --> 00:33:21.210
We're definitely eager to get ahead.

00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:23.289
Also, during my graduate studies,

00:33:23.289 --> 00:33:24.010
I'd heard

00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:26.089
that you nearly did pro bono work
every month

00:33:26.329 --> 00:33:28.089
during your internship at the firm.

00:33:28.329 --> 00:33:29.730
Strong leaders have no weak teams.

00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:31.410
We must follow your example.

00:33:31.609 --> 00:33:32.650
Come on. Head back now.

00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:34.529
Don't flatter me.

00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:36.010
I've been there.

00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:37.609
I know exactly what's on your minds.

00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:40.490
Wanting to earn more points is fine.

00:33:40.552 --> 00:33:41.769
But remember this.

00:33:41.769 --> 00:33:43.930
Legal consultation
is a long-standing tradition.

00:33:44.170 --> 00:33:45.490
It started back with Mr. Zhuang.

00:33:45.809 --> 00:33:47.250
Ms. Bai and Mr. Song participated.

00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:48.970
So treat this seriously.

00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:50.690
Don't tarnish Jun An's reputation.

00:33:51.089 --> 00:33:51.609
Therefore,

00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:53.210
give it your proper attention.

00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:54.410
Never brush off anyone

00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:55.650
who seeks your advice.

00:33:56.329 --> 00:33:57.010
Don't worry.

00:33:57.210 --> 00:33:58.129
I've got experience.

00:33:58.490 --> 00:34:00.010
Our university did legal outreach

00:34:00.010 --> 00:34:01.210
at middle schools before.

00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:01.992
It was successful.

00:34:02.529 --> 00:34:03.569
I even received

00:34:04.369 --> 00:34:05.512
the Most Approachable Award.

00:34:07.849 --> 00:34:09.209
If there are no other questions,

00:34:09.370 --> 00:34:10.810
let's depart at 9:00 AM.

00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:11.330
Okay.

00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:11.976
Got it.

00:34:42.248 --> 00:34:43.080
(Guo Xiaoyu: Jiang Chen, Ren Jiatong,
you two did pro bono work.)

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:44.040
(Do you have any experience to share?)
(From: Talent Hunt Program Group)

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:45.256
(Huang Yue:
I'd like to ask for advice too.)

00:34:45.256 --> 00:34:46.184
(Li Ke: Please share your insights.)

00:34:46.184 --> 00:34:47.016
(Jiang Chen: We'll talk later.)

00:34:47.016 --> 00:34:48.232
(Ren Jiatong: We'll talk later.)

00:34:49.689 --> 00:34:50.370
Yan Da.

00:34:50.970 --> 00:34:51.729
Yan Da.

00:34:57.569 --> 00:34:58.850
This outfit is quite cute.

00:34:59.729 --> 00:35:01.064
It reminds me of you as a child.

00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:03.649
But you were chubbier back then.

00:35:04.330 --> 00:35:05.249
Now, you're too thin.

00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:08.850
Why didn't I know

00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:09.770
about our firm's

00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:10.810
pro bono work?

00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:11.890
Why did you meddle?

00:35:14.649 --> 00:35:16.410
You were so drunk last night.

00:35:17.129 --> 00:35:18.689
Can't you just rest at home?

00:35:19.890 --> 00:35:21.209
Can you stop controlling me?

00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:22.888
Fei.

00:35:24.049 --> 00:35:24.649
You want

00:35:25.089 --> 00:35:25.930
to prove yourself.

00:35:26.729 --> 00:35:27.609
I understand that.

00:35:29.290 --> 00:35:30.664
But as a child of the Yan family,

00:35:31.129 --> 00:35:33.169
you don't need to work that hard.

00:35:35.010 --> 00:35:36.689
I've already spoken to your leader.

00:35:38.169 --> 00:35:39.330
You mean Mr. Zhuang?

00:35:40.249 --> 00:35:41.450
Or one of the senior partners?

00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:43.970
I just don't get it.

00:35:44.689 --> 00:35:46.370
What's so great about being a lawyer?

00:35:46.729 --> 00:35:48.089
Working like a dog every day.

00:35:48.569 --> 00:35:49.410
Forcing smiles

00:35:49.609 --> 00:35:51.249
in front of difficult clients.

00:35:52.169 --> 00:35:53.850
Top two Red Circle Firms?

00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:55.729
It's still just the service industry.

00:35:58.129 --> 00:35:59.649
Why be the service provider

00:36:00.129 --> 00:36:01.330
when you could be the client?

00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:03.089
Yes, Mr. Yan.

00:36:03.529 --> 00:36:05.770
Being the client has made you

00:36:05.770 --> 00:36:07.410
feel entitled to parent me, hasn't it?

00:36:07.930 --> 00:36:08.552
Fei.

00:36:09.089 --> 00:36:09.649
I know you.

00:36:10.049 --> 00:36:11.649
You rarely ask for my help.

00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:13.089
But this time,

00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:16.649
you asked me to secure Eddie's funding
for Warm Nest.

00:36:18.169 --> 00:36:18.810
I don't care

00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:20.089
to know what happened.

00:36:20.729 --> 00:36:21.890
But I won't tolerate anyone

00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:23.850
exploiting my sister's kindness

00:36:24.249 --> 00:36:25.370
and our family's resources

00:36:25.569 --> 00:36:26.689
to realize their own goal.

00:36:28.169 --> 00:36:29.089
So after this round,

00:36:30.010 --> 00:36:31.129
leave Jun An

00:36:31.850 --> 00:36:32.770
gracefully.

00:36:37.330 --> 00:36:39.129
Yan Da, I'm telling you now.

00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:40.930
I love defying you.

00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:43.169
I never planned to stay long at Jun An.

00:36:43.609 --> 00:36:44.370
But now,

00:36:44.850 --> 00:36:45.689
I'm staying for sure.

00:36:57.810 --> 00:36:59.129
(Jun An Law Carnival)
Thank you, you look lovely.

00:36:59.770 --> 00:37:00.330
Bye-bye.

00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:01.000
Bye-bye.

00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:02.472
Fei.

00:37:03.850 --> 00:37:04.810
Come on.

00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:05.890
Why didn't you tell me?

00:37:07.912 --> 00:37:08.689
(Pro Bono Legal Aid)

00:37:08.689 --> 00:37:09.320
Where are they?

00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:10.850
What's with your outfit?

00:37:11.529 --> 00:37:12.810
Jiang Chen and Ren Jiatong

00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:14.169
are helping a madam move things.

00:37:14.169 --> 00:37:15.850
Huang Yue and Li Ke
are playing with kids.

00:37:16.049 --> 00:37:17.320
We just finished a legal play.

00:37:17.609 --> 00:37:18.770
I wore this Hanfu

00:37:18.850 --> 00:37:20.689
to draw more people over.

00:37:22.890 --> 00:37:24.649
What are you talking about?

00:37:24.649 --> 00:37:25.970
What's that about the legal play?

00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:27.209
- The play is...
- Yan Fei

00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:28.890
Help me.

00:37:30.169 --> 00:37:30.810
See you later.

00:37:32.529 --> 00:37:34.410
Come and look.

00:37:34.609 --> 00:37:36.370
Jun An's free legal consultation.

00:37:36.649 --> 00:37:37.410
Completely free.

00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:46.729
The community sent some water.

00:37:47.129 --> 00:37:48.729
As you can see, besides me...

00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:49.576
Right?

00:37:49.689 --> 00:37:50.248
I can't move.

00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:51.850
Help me carry some.

00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:53.450
Mr. Zhou.

00:37:54.010 --> 00:37:55.689
Your acting could use some work.

00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:58.169
You're pretending to be helpless
to give me a way out?

00:37:58.490 --> 00:37:59.890
But these props are terrible.

00:38:00.569 --> 00:38:01.890
I'll carry two cases later.

00:38:04.209 --> 00:38:06.609
You came all this way.
You must be thirsty.

00:38:08.169 --> 00:38:08.890
Since you know

00:38:08.890 --> 00:38:10.649
I came all the way here,

00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:12.410
why wasn't I included in this event?

00:38:12.649 --> 00:38:13.450
I did email you.

00:38:13.649 --> 00:38:15.649
Right, and I replied to that email.

00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:17.249
But you guys made a separate group.

00:38:17.249 --> 00:38:18.330
I wasn't in that group.

00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:19.529
May I ask why?

00:38:21.649 --> 00:38:22.729
I made a mistake.

00:38:23.169 --> 00:38:25.089
Since you're here,
let me brief you on the job.

00:38:26.209 --> 00:38:26.729
Take a look.

00:38:28.850 --> 00:38:29.609
Typically,

00:38:29.729 --> 00:38:31.049
people who seek legal advice here

00:38:31.330 --> 00:38:33.089
are mostly residents of this community.

00:38:33.209 --> 00:38:34.729
Rarely major cases.

00:38:34.850 --> 00:38:36.249
Just everyday domestic disputes.

00:38:36.810 --> 00:38:38.249
Some trivial matters

00:38:38.490 --> 00:38:39.169
you never met.

00:38:39.649 --> 00:38:42.056
The money they've lost
might be less than your bag's worth.

00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:43.330
But to them,

00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:45.490
it could represent
half a lifetime of savings,

00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:48.249
or their retirement fund,
even life-saving money.

00:38:48.529 --> 00:38:50.689
You've been talking in circles

00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:52.370
without badmouthing my brother

00:38:52.729 --> 00:38:54.370
or trying to drive a wedge between us.

00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:55.290
You're a good person.

00:38:55.970 --> 00:38:57.609
After we drank together last time,

00:38:57.609 --> 00:38:59.010
I thought we'd become friends.

00:38:59.129 --> 00:39:01.249
Turns out it was all one-sided.

00:39:01.729 --> 00:39:03.490
You won't offend Xingke's CEO

00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:05.450
to protect your legal career.

00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:07.129
That's very lawyer-like. Very proper.

00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:09.010
So today, just watch carefully

00:39:09.129 --> 00:39:10.890
how well I handle this consultation.

00:39:31.089 --> 00:39:32.010
It's gotten chubby.

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:34.010
Yeah, definitely.

00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:35.450
It has a big stomach.

00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:38.209
Seems even chubbier than last time.

00:39:38.649 --> 00:39:39.290
Absolutely.

00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:40.049
Looks nice.

00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:43.490
It eats the noodles

00:39:43.529 --> 00:39:44.850
that customers can't finish.

00:39:45.729 --> 00:39:46.810
It became much chubbier.

00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:49.930
I'm going to cook for you.

00:39:50.089 --> 00:39:50.770
Thanks.

00:40:04.456 --> 00:40:05.649
Why are you here alone?

00:40:06.209 --> 00:40:06.952
Where's Xiaoyu?

00:40:07.609 --> 00:40:08.970
Xiaoyu met a girl

00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:10.649
who's into Hanfu culture.

00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:12.450
Got called away by her later.

00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:13.290
That's all I know.

00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:14.344
Acting all mysterious.

00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:16.089
So I came by myself.

00:40:16.490 --> 00:40:17.970
I want to eat noodles.

00:40:19.410 --> 00:40:20.930
Noodles are ready!

00:40:21.049 --> 00:40:21.608
Thank you.

00:40:22.490 --> 00:40:23.049
Thanks.

00:40:23.569 --> 00:40:24.649
Glad you like to eat them.

00:40:25.049 --> 00:40:26.010
If you want,

00:40:26.049 --> 00:40:27.609
just message me on WeChat.

00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:28.810
I'll cook early.

00:40:28.810 --> 00:40:29.490
Once you arrive,

00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:30.609
you can eat then.

00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:31.432
Thanks.

00:40:32.089 --> 00:40:32.729
Enjoy your meal.

00:40:44.410 --> 00:40:45.089
How did you know?

00:40:45.649 --> 00:40:47.010
We've eaten together many times.

00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:48.008
I know your preferences.

00:40:48.569 --> 00:40:49.330
You put chili oil

00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:50.609
in everything.

00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:53.450
Same with coffee,
you only have Americanos, nothing else.

00:40:53.729 --> 00:40:54.728
Chugging cup after cup.

00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:57.729
Actually,
spiciness gives you a sense of pain,

00:40:57.729 --> 00:40:58.696
not a sense of taste.

00:40:59.010 --> 00:41:00.249
Are you into strong flavors?

00:41:00.729 --> 00:41:02.129
Or do you actually enjoy that pain?

00:41:02.729 --> 00:41:04.370
You notice such small details.

00:41:04.370 --> 00:41:05.770
If I didn't know you so well,

00:41:05.890 --> 00:41:07.272
I'd think you had a crush on me.

00:41:14.569 --> 00:41:15.240
What?

00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:19.649
To be frank, bashful boys

00:41:19.649 --> 00:41:20.529
are not popular now.

00:41:23.209 --> 00:41:24.290
Why are you blushing?

00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:26.450
Are you crushing on me?

00:41:26.609 --> 00:41:27.609
I'm not blushing.

00:41:27.850 --> 00:41:29.330
Did Guo Xiaoyu possess you?

00:41:29.330 --> 00:41:30.089
Or have you

00:41:30.089 --> 00:41:31.810
taken an interest in my hobby

00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:32.609
of observing people?

00:41:33.970 --> 00:41:34.664
Also,

00:41:35.169 --> 00:41:36.529
usually, skilled hunters

00:41:36.529 --> 00:41:38.049
disguise themselves as prey.

00:41:38.049 --> 00:41:38.890
Watch yourself.

00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:41.609
Are you saying you want to be my prey?

00:41:43.569 --> 00:41:44.330
You're insane.

00:41:47.770 --> 00:41:48.392
Water.

00:41:51.370 --> 00:41:51.970
The other day,

00:41:53.129 --> 00:41:54.010
I passed by your desk

00:41:54.569 --> 00:41:56.129
and saw a file on your computer.

00:41:56.609 --> 00:41:57.729
It wasn't a Jun An case.

00:41:58.689 --> 00:41:59.368
I'm telling you,

00:41:59.890 --> 00:42:00.890
we're in a competition.

00:42:02.049 --> 00:42:02.810
You have to focus.

00:42:05.729 --> 00:42:06.490
That?

00:42:07.410 --> 00:42:08.930
That's from an old friend of my dad's.

00:42:09.330 --> 00:42:10.370
He helped our family.

00:42:10.569 --> 00:42:12.129
He just needs some legal advice.

00:42:12.249 --> 00:42:13.010
I want to help.

00:42:13.729 --> 00:42:15.729
Aren't you worried I'll tell on you?

00:42:16.890 --> 00:42:18.920
If you wanted to,
you wouldn't have said all this.

00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:22.569
Listen,

00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:24.890
I'm not bringing this up as leverage

00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:25.890
for the competition

00:42:26.529 --> 00:42:27.850
or to accuse you of anything.

00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:29.529
We're competing now.

00:42:29.609 --> 00:42:32.049
I need you to focus and give your all.

00:42:32.249 --> 00:42:33.529
Your rival is right before you.

00:42:33.729 --> 00:42:35.410
Even though you give all of yourself,

00:42:35.770 --> 00:42:37.129
I doubt you could beat me,

00:42:37.410 --> 00:42:38.824
let alone when you're distracted.

00:42:39.129 --> 00:42:40.049
You underestimate me?

00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:44.104
Fine.

00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:46.169
Starting today,

00:42:46.689 --> 00:42:48.129
I'll take you seriously.

00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:51.209
Bitter girls

00:42:51.209 --> 00:42:53.169
aren't popular either.

00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:55.049
You're a quick learner.

00:42:55.208 --> 00:42:56.529
Learn to take care of yourself.

00:42:56.529 --> 00:42:58.410
Shut down your computer
when leaving your desk.

00:43:00.810 --> 00:43:01.704
Don't get emotional.

00:43:02.609 --> 00:43:03.569
I hate braised eggs.

00:43:11.496 --> 00:43:14.344
(Noodles)

00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:16.936
(The core value of the pro bono work.)

00:43:16.936 --> 00:43:18.216
(Answer: The pro bono work
aims to safeguard public interests)

00:43:18.216 --> 00:43:19.656
(and the rights of vulnerable groups.)

00:43:19.656 --> 00:43:21.416
(It involves nonprofit legal assistance
and activities provided by diverse entities.)

00:43:21.416 --> 00:43:23.048
(Essentially, it redirects legal resources
toward the public interest,)

00:43:23.048 --> 00:43:24.776
(filling the legal twilight gap unaddressed
by conventional legal services.)

00:43:24.776 --> 00:43:26.536
(This embodies
crucial legal professional ethics.)

00:43:26.536 --> 00:43:28.072
(It also serves as an indispensable mechanism
for a society governed by law.)
