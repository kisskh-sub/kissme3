Happy New Year, Jay.

00:02:05.898 --> 00:02:07.900
I feel like I’m going crazy.

00:02:08.126 --> 00:02:09.753
Or am I already crazy?

00:02:14.532 --> 00:02:17.785
So much has happened ever since
I wore this uniform.

00:02:45.117 --> 00:02:47.370
Section E!!!

00:03:25.895 --> 00:03:27.730
Why did you even do that, Jay-jay?

00:03:27.897 --> 00:03:29.648
You almost got carried away!

00:03:30.733 --> 00:03:31.709
You really are crazy!

00:03:31.734 --> 00:03:32.835
You’re weak!

00:03:52.713 --> 00:03:55.007
Later I’m going to
see the King of Assholes,

00:03:55.424 --> 00:03:57.009
and after that…

00:04:11.482 --> 00:04:13.192
I already accepted Yuri’s proposal,

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:15.986
so I shouldn’t have done that to Keifer.

00:04:16.403 --> 00:04:17.905
Control yourself, Jay.

00:04:18.072 --> 00:04:19.323
Jay?

00:04:20.241 --> 00:04:21.242
Yes?

00:04:23.548 --> 00:04:24.549
Wow!

00:04:24.995 --> 00:04:27.039
Jay, the room looks so nice.

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:29.335
Is this part of your New Year's resolution?

00:04:30.211 --> 00:04:33.840
Yes, Auntie.
A new look for a new life.

00:04:36.484 --> 00:04:38.734
By the way,
Yuri asked for permission.

00:04:38.923 --> 00:04:41.801
He said he'll pick you up,
he's probably downstairs already.

00:04:41.971 --> 00:04:44.490
Ah okay, I'll go down in a while.

00:04:44.515 --> 00:04:45.515
Alright.

00:04:52.273 --> 00:04:53.816
Yuri…

00:04:54.066 --> 00:04:55.359
Right.

00:04:55.609 --> 00:04:58.821
I’m already engaged, so I shouldn’t be
thinking about Keifer anymore.

00:05:08.693 --> 00:05:09.968
You can do this, Jay-jay.

00:05:14.253 --> 00:05:16.547
Let’s just forget
what happened on New Year’s.

00:07:06.657 --> 00:07:07.658
Good morning.

00:07:09.451 --> 00:07:11.287
Give that to me, I’ll carry it.

00:07:12.204 --> 00:07:14.498
No, it’s fine.
It's not heavy.

00:07:17.501 --> 00:07:20.838
Why did you pick me up?
I can bike on my own.

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:24.255
Of course—fiancé duties.

00:07:25.009 --> 00:07:26.468
Fiancé…

00:07:27.052 --> 00:07:29.346
Shit, it sounds so heavy.

00:07:29.427 --> 00:07:30.511
I’m not used to it.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:34.101
Let’s go.

00:07:34.727 --> 00:07:35.737
No.

00:07:36.603 --> 00:07:38.063
She’s not going with you.

00:07:38.314 --> 00:07:39.189
Leave.

00:07:39.189 --> 00:07:40.899
You're not the one
who's going to decide here.

00:07:41.525 --> 00:07:45.487
Aries, it’s okay.
I also want to talk to Yuri.

00:07:45.863 --> 00:07:48.866
If you had just listened to me,

00:07:49.127 --> 00:07:51.629
you wouldn’t have been
set up in that engagement.

00:07:51.744 --> 00:07:52.720
Right?

00:07:52.745 --> 00:07:54.121
Engagement...

00:07:54.496 --> 00:07:55.539
Set-up...

00:07:55.539 --> 00:07:56.540
Let's go.

00:08:28.663 --> 00:08:29.745
Are you okay?

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:31.272
You’ve been quiet.

00:08:32.842 --> 00:08:34.682
Of course, I’m fine.

00:08:35.204 --> 00:08:36.997
Have you talked to Angelo yet?

00:08:39.133 --> 00:08:41.927
I'm not ready to talk to him yet.

00:08:47.091 --> 00:08:48.092
I'm sorry, Jay.

00:08:48.634 --> 00:08:50.979
I wasn’t honest about
my feelings for you.

00:08:51.917 --> 00:08:55.003
But from now on,
I’ll be more honest.

00:08:57.059 --> 00:08:58.477
We’re engaged.

00:08:58.959 --> 00:09:02.462
So I should also be honest with him
about what happened on New Year’s.

00:09:03.049 --> 00:09:04.550
Uhmm, I need to confess something—

00:09:04.575 --> 00:09:06.535
Is it about Keifer?

00:09:08.704 --> 00:09:09.705
It's okay, Jay.

00:09:12.041 --> 00:09:13.417
I don’t want to hear it anymore.

00:09:15.795 --> 00:09:16.796
I'm sorry.

00:09:17.046 --> 00:09:18.547
You don’t need to apologize.

00:09:19.131 --> 00:09:20.591
I understand you,

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:23.854
but I’ll wait for you Jay
no matter how long.

00:09:25.056 --> 00:09:26.766
Even until the day of our wedding.

00:09:27.265 --> 00:09:28.724
If that's what it takes.

00:09:28.749 --> 00:09:29.750
Yuri.

00:09:35.398 --> 00:09:36.524
I'm okay, Jay.

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:38.776
Don't worry.

00:09:40.751 --> 00:09:44.156
My only wish is that
you give me a chance.

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:46.492
Please don't close off your heart.

00:09:47.368 --> 00:09:49.287
I hope you still choose me in the end.

00:09:57.211 --> 00:09:58.421
Honestly,

00:09:58.879 --> 00:10:01.382
I don’t even know what I feel for Yuri.

00:10:01.842 --> 00:10:03.177
Is it guilt?

00:10:03.426 --> 00:10:05.011
Because he’s kind to me?

00:10:05.598 --> 00:10:08.226
Or is it because of
my obligation to my family?

00:10:08.806 --> 00:10:10.892
Ugh, whatever.
Whatever happens, happens.

00:10:12.893 --> 00:10:13.894
Uhm...

00:10:15.313 --> 00:10:18.357
How are we going to
tell our classmates?

00:10:18.858 --> 00:10:20.818
I don’t think they need to know.

00:10:21.485 --> 00:10:22.564
Why?

00:10:22.611 --> 00:10:24.238
It’ll just cause chaos if they find out—

00:10:24.238 --> 00:10:26.907
especially since they know
Keifer has feelings for you.

00:10:28.284 --> 00:10:31.996
Yeah, you’re right.
It might cause trouble.

00:10:46.927 --> 00:10:48.262
Great idea.

00:10:51.182 --> 00:10:52.308
There.

00:10:53.184 --> 00:10:54.602
That’s good.

00:10:57.621 --> 00:10:58.706
Ouch!

00:10:58.731 --> 00:10:59.940
What was that for?

00:11:01.734 --> 00:11:03.798
I don’t want things
to be awkward between us, Jay.

00:11:03.986 --> 00:11:06.530
Act like the same Jay you are
whenever we’re together,

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:07.740
and I'll do the same.

00:11:09.241 --> 00:11:10.329
You’re right.

00:11:10.659 --> 00:11:12.203
Ouch! That really hurts!

00:11:12.995 --> 00:11:15.079
That’s not enough—
want one on your forehead too?

00:11:15.539 --> 00:11:17.291
Come on, let’s go.
We might be late.

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:18.350
Wait, wait, wait.

00:11:18.376 --> 00:11:19.126
- What?
- I forgot something.

00:11:19.126 --> 00:11:20.087
What?

00:11:27.009 --> 00:11:28.094
I'll go ahead.

00:11:30.554 --> 00:11:32.056
Can I ask for one more favor?

00:11:33.182 --> 00:11:34.212
What?

00:11:34.517 --> 00:11:36.352
Can you stop picking me up
and taking me home?

00:11:36.769 --> 00:11:40.356
Someone might,
you know, notice.

00:11:41.565 --> 00:11:42.566
Okay.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:43.901
Alright.

00:12:14.348 --> 00:12:16.725
Okay, Jay-jay.
We'll do what is right.

00:12:16.825 --> 00:12:19.495
You're already engaged to Yuri,
time to forget about Keif—

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:20.525
Fuck!

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:25.901
Tss. Profanity on
the first day back?

00:12:26.694 --> 00:12:28.446
Or did you just miss my lips?

00:12:29.738 --> 00:12:31.031
What? Keifer!

00:12:31.949 --> 00:12:33.784
- Stop this.
- Why?

00:12:33.951 --> 00:12:36.537
- What do you mean "why"? Keifer, please.
- Stop what?

00:12:37.288 --> 00:12:41.459
This! What you're doing right now.
Stop flirting with me.

00:12:42.334 --> 00:12:45.504
What's wrong if I flirt with you?

00:12:47.047 --> 00:12:49.341
What's wrong if I flirt
with the one I love?

00:12:52.803 --> 00:12:54.388
It's wrong.

00:12:55.389 --> 00:12:57.141
It's as if I'm cheating on Yuri.

00:12:58.017 --> 00:12:59.337
We're already engaged,

00:12:59.393 --> 00:13:00.478
stay away from me.

00:13:02.229 --> 00:13:03.439
Cheating?

00:13:04.288 --> 00:13:06.206
We're not in a relationship.

00:13:06.734 --> 00:13:08.527
So how are we cheating on him?

00:13:09.153 --> 00:13:11.113
You're not cheating on Yuri

00:13:11.822 --> 00:13:13.949
because we're not in a relationship.

00:13:20.623 --> 00:13:23.375
If that's the case,
then leave me alone!

00:13:25.211 --> 00:13:28.839
We're not in a relationship, but…

00:13:31.175 --> 00:13:32.510
you are mine.

00:13:33.093 --> 00:13:35.054
You know what, you're crazy.

00:13:35.971 --> 00:13:37.264
Crazy for you?

00:13:37.264 --> 00:13:38.933
Yeah, I think so.

00:14:09.588 --> 00:14:11.882
I’ll wait for you Jay no matter how long.

00:14:11.882 --> 00:14:13.509
Even until the day of our wedding.

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:19.515
Fuck!

00:14:25.521 --> 00:14:26.897
You'll pay for this!

00:14:36.365 --> 00:14:39.076
Welcome back, bro!

00:14:39.994 --> 00:14:41.453
Come on, hurry, let’s play.

00:14:44.665 --> 00:14:45.374
Jay!

00:14:45.374 --> 00:14:46.458
How was vacation?

00:14:47.126 --> 00:14:48.752
It was okay.
How about you and Mica?

00:14:49.378 --> 00:14:50.754
Obviously they ran out of condoms again—

00:14:50.754 --> 00:14:52.423
he even asked me for some.
Said it wasn’t enough.

00:14:52.423 --> 00:14:53.799
- He asked you?
- Idiot!

00:14:54.883 --> 00:14:55.426
Asshole!

00:14:55.426 --> 00:14:56.510
Unbelievable!

00:14:57.386 --> 00:14:59.138
- Ouch!
- Hey, Jay!

00:14:59.305 --> 00:15:01.223
Everyone already went on vacation
but you're still sour.

00:15:01.223 --> 00:15:02.224
Didn't you—

00:15:02.433 --> 00:15:04.643
Stop it!
It’s New Year, have you changed?

00:15:04.643 --> 00:15:05.853
- Of course, man!
- Yeah right!

00:15:06.312 --> 00:15:07.730
He gambled all his Christmas money.

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:09.732
- Obviously.
- You're really something, huh.

00:15:10.328 --> 00:15:11.819
You don't have money!

00:15:12.401 --> 00:15:14.695
Hey, hey! What’s going on?

00:15:15.195 --> 00:15:16.488
How’s Grace?

00:15:17.156 --> 00:15:18.449
She has lots of cravings.

00:15:18.574 --> 00:15:19.700
- She's always hungry.
- That’s normal.

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:20.634
Just like you.

00:15:20.659 --> 00:15:21.510
Oh really?

00:15:21.535 --> 00:15:22.453
Ouch.

00:15:22.453 --> 00:15:25.205
- Too early in the morning.
- You’re already annoying this early!

00:15:27.082 --> 00:15:28.085
Jay!

00:15:30.044 --> 00:15:32.630
Collect everyone’s contribution
for the food.

00:15:40.179 --> 00:15:42.348
Ignored? What’s his problem?

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.714
Hey, where’s Ci-N?

00:15:50.814 --> 00:15:53.275
He’s not here.
He’s not answering my calls.

00:15:53.692 --> 00:15:56.320
Huh? What happened to him?

00:15:56.612 --> 00:15:58.656
Should I go to their house later?

00:15:59.198 --> 00:16:01.825
But what if his grumpy
brother is there?

00:16:06.705 --> 00:16:07.831
Hi, Jay!

00:16:19.051 --> 00:16:20.427
Damn!

00:16:20.761 --> 00:16:22.304
What happened to your lip, bro?

00:16:22.304 --> 00:16:23.423
Did you get into a fight?

00:16:23.722 --> 00:16:25.474
Looks like your lips
saw some action, Keif.

00:16:25.474 --> 00:16:26.680
You want some lip balm?

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:30.890
You deserve it.

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:32.731
Tss.

00:16:33.065 --> 00:16:34.066
Hey, what's up.

00:16:35.984 --> 00:16:37.611
- Rory!
- Hey!

00:16:42.741 --> 00:16:45.452
If you look at us,
it seems like nothing has changed.

00:16:45.452 --> 00:16:46.495
Hey, that didn’t hit!

00:16:46.495 --> 00:16:48.205
Throw it!

00:16:58.006 --> 00:17:00.342
Asshole! Hey asshole!

00:17:02.761 --> 00:17:03.798
Fuck!

00:17:05.097 --> 00:17:06.180
Chill with that.

00:17:12.062 --> 00:17:15.065
But the truth is,
a lot has already changed.

00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:19.153
- Hey, bro.
- Ah!

00:17:20.112 --> 00:17:21.572
Settle down, settle down.

00:17:25.483 --> 00:17:26.860
Welcome back, class!

00:17:32.666 --> 00:17:35.794
We’ve already started
planning your retreat.

00:17:36.128 --> 00:17:37.588
We’re included in that, Sir?

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:42.468
All students join the retreat
before graduating.

00:17:42.468 --> 00:17:44.970
For real?
So we’re actually graduating?

00:17:47.598 --> 00:17:49.683
All I can say is,

00:17:49.683 --> 00:17:51.704
there will be lots of activities
during the retreat.

00:17:52.728 --> 00:17:53.812
When is it, Sir?

00:17:53.812 --> 00:17:57.691
No definite date yet,
but earlier than the usual retreat.

00:17:57.691 --> 00:18:00.778
It’s just a bit tricky because
of the post-final exams.

00:18:03.614 --> 00:18:05.407
What’s the post-final exams?

00:18:05.908 --> 00:18:07.701
There’s a fifth exam.

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:10.496
And that determines whether
a student passes or not.

00:18:10.496 --> 00:18:11.298
Huh?

00:18:11.323 --> 00:18:12.658
Why is there even a fifth exam?

00:18:13.081 --> 00:18:16.251
So if a student doesn’t pass,
they won’t graduate?

00:18:18.212 --> 00:18:20.547
Don’t worry Jay, I got you.

00:18:20.756 --> 00:18:21.805
You will graduate.

00:18:31.934 --> 00:18:33.894
Food, food, food!

00:18:34.478 --> 00:18:36.438
That's all?

00:18:36.605 --> 00:18:38.148
That’s all we have left.

00:18:38.398 --> 00:18:40.000
You guys still haven’t
pitched in for the groceries.

00:18:40.025 --> 00:18:41.585
- True!
- You’re really something, huh!

00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:42.753
Alright, alright.

00:18:42.778 --> 00:18:45.727
Wow, you're quick to dodge
when it's time to chip in!

00:18:46.365 --> 00:18:47.241
Do you hear anything?

00:18:47.241 --> 00:18:48.408
One at a time!

00:18:51.428 --> 00:18:52.288
Fine, here.

00:18:52.313 --> 00:18:53.649
- Let's split it.
- Ah!

00:18:54.915 --> 00:18:55.916
Plate.

00:18:58.460 --> 00:18:59.571
Dish.

00:18:59.837 --> 00:19:00.868
Rice.

00:19:01.964 --> 00:19:02.977
More.

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:07.911
Just eat it already.

00:19:13.934 --> 00:19:15.143
Move aside.

00:19:15.519 --> 00:19:16.937
And if I don’t want to?

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:25.946
Do you want me to tell them what
we did last New Year’s Eve?

00:19:27.698 --> 00:19:28.991
What do you want?

00:19:30.117 --> 00:19:31.118
Nothing.

00:19:31.118 --> 00:19:32.411
You just look cute when you eat.

00:19:32.411 --> 00:19:33.704
Is it bad to watch?

00:19:34.413 --> 00:19:35.831
Yes! Go away!

00:19:37.833 --> 00:19:39.001
Bro, let's share.

00:19:39.501 --> 00:19:40.669
All of that is yours?

00:19:43.589 --> 00:19:44.756
Is there a problem, Jay?

00:19:46.967 --> 00:19:49.803
Ah nothing, he’s just teasing me.

00:19:50.137 --> 00:19:51.166
You sure?

00:20:01.189 --> 00:20:03.817
Remember, you are mine.

00:20:09.448 --> 00:20:10.282
Jay!

00:20:10.282 --> 00:20:11.575
No one follow me!

00:20:11.575 --> 00:20:13.035
No one is following you.

00:20:28.258 --> 00:20:30.469
There, nice!

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:32.888
So refreshing!

00:20:33.764 --> 00:20:37.601
I'm sure nobody will bother me here.

00:20:39.144 --> 00:20:40.562
Let me call that brat.

00:20:52.282 --> 00:20:53.659
He won’t answer.

00:20:57.463 --> 00:20:58.646
Ugh!

00:20:59.348 --> 00:21:00.349
Fuck!

00:21:00.374 --> 00:21:01.416
Who’s that?

00:21:03.001 --> 00:21:05.212
Oh, Edrix!

00:21:05.837 --> 00:21:07.547
I thought it was someone else!

00:21:07.756 --> 00:21:09.049
What are you doing here?

00:21:16.056 --> 00:21:17.265
Sorry.

00:21:17.933 --> 00:21:19.393
I just couldn’t help it.

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:24.147
Do you have a problem?

00:21:27.317 --> 00:21:28.527
I’m mad at myself!

00:21:30.153 --> 00:21:31.238
I'm such a coward!

00:21:33.699 --> 00:21:34.716
Why?

00:21:36.702 --> 00:21:39.079
Unrequited love is just
so damn hard!

00:21:39.246 --> 00:21:40.622
I can’t even tell her…

00:21:41.623 --> 00:21:42.874
or show her.

00:21:46.169 --> 00:21:47.713
Yeah, that’s really hard.

00:21:48.839 --> 00:21:50.924
But at least you’re sure.

00:21:51.508 --> 00:21:52.843
It’s only one person.

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:56.555
It's harder when you're stuck
between two.

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:02.019
But who is it anyway?

00:22:07.941 --> 00:22:10.610
Wow, she’s pretty!

00:22:11.236 --> 00:22:12.529
Freya really is pretty.

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:15.699
Yeah, she’s really—WHAT?

00:22:17.909 --> 00:22:18.994
That's Freya?

00:22:22.456 --> 00:22:23.932
F-Freya is the one
you’re talking about?

00:22:23.957 --> 00:22:24.975
Yeah.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.193
It's been a long time Jay.

00:22:27.794 --> 00:22:30.589
Wow, what a revelation.

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:32.716
But...

00:22:33.425 --> 00:22:35.010
let’s keep this between us, okay?

00:22:36.136 --> 00:22:37.201
Promise?

00:22:49.232 --> 00:22:50.484
You don’t have food?

00:22:52.069 --> 00:22:52.652
That’s food?

00:22:52.736 --> 00:22:55.297
Yeah, we were eating downstairs.

00:22:55.322 --> 00:22:56.873
And you’re here being dramatic.

00:23:08.126 --> 00:23:08.935
Whose is this?

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:11.546
- Auntie, I’m really starving promise.
- Looks like it.

00:23:11.713 --> 00:23:13.340
Don’t worry, there’s another box there.

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:14.674
All of that is for you.

00:23:14.966 --> 00:23:16.009
We have a visitor?

00:23:16.468 --> 00:23:19.179
Relax, there’s more in the kitchen.

00:23:20.013 --> 00:23:21.264
- This tastes so good, Auntie.
- Good?

00:23:21.515 --> 00:23:22.529
Ci-N?

00:23:25.894 --> 00:23:26.937
You idiot!

00:23:27.104 --> 00:23:28.357
What happened to you?

00:23:28.772 --> 00:23:31.233
Do you know how
worried I was, you brat?!

00:23:31.441 --> 00:23:32.275
Really?

00:23:32.275 --> 00:23:33.466
You were concerned about me?

00:23:33.652 --> 00:23:35.987
Wow, you’re so sweet, Jay.

00:23:36.279 --> 00:23:37.656
Don’t be like that, Jay-jay!

00:23:37.656 --> 00:23:38.657
Sorry, Auntie.

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:40.492
This kid didn't attend school today.

00:23:42.244 --> 00:23:44.704
I’ll leave you two to catch up.

00:23:44.871 --> 00:23:46.248
I’ll prepare dinner.

00:23:46.289 --> 00:23:47.499
Thank you, Auntie.

00:23:51.128 --> 00:23:52.462
You've got some nerve!

00:23:52.504 --> 00:23:53.672
Enjoying the food too much, huh?

00:23:53.672 --> 00:23:54.631
Why weren’t you in class?

00:23:54.673 --> 00:23:55.522
It hurts, Jay!

00:23:55.547 --> 00:23:56.966
- Oh really!
- I’ll tell Auntie!

00:23:57.342 --> 00:23:58.607
What happened to you?

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:04.182
What’s the problem?

00:24:06.393 --> 00:24:07.396
Because…

00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:09.688
my brother locked me up.

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:11.740
He said...

00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:15.110
he’s sending me to London
because I keep on causing trouble.

00:24:15.402 --> 00:24:17.487
Said I’m wasting my potential.

00:24:18.238 --> 00:24:19.823
Of course
I wasn’t going to allow that.

00:24:19.823 --> 00:24:22.367
So yeah,
he locked me in my room.

00:24:24.327 --> 00:24:25.829
I was worried about you.

00:24:27.289 --> 00:24:27.956
Sorry…

00:24:27.956 --> 00:24:29.833
He confiscated my gadgets,

00:24:29.833 --> 00:24:30.959
I couldn’t message you.

00:24:31.418 --> 00:24:32.836
Is that all he did?

00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:34.087
He didn't hit you?

00:24:34.087 --> 00:24:35.105
No!

00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:36.006
You know why?

00:24:36.006 --> 00:24:36.464
Why?

00:24:36.464 --> 00:24:37.757
Because I ran away.

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:40.051
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

00:24:40.552 --> 00:24:43.430
He said if I won’t listen,
I should just leave.

00:24:44.139 --> 00:24:45.765
Where would you go?

00:24:45.932 --> 00:24:46.933
Here. With you!

00:24:47.142 --> 00:24:49.035
That’s not allowed, are you crazy?!

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:50.854
Why not?
Angelo said it was okay.

00:24:50.854 --> 00:24:52.105
What Angelo?

00:24:52.189 --> 00:24:53.023
You made that up!

00:24:53.023 --> 00:24:54.983
Right Angelo, it’s okay?

00:24:55.275 --> 00:24:56.443
Yes, that’s true.

00:24:57.152 --> 00:24:58.945
Oh—see?

00:25:00.113 --> 00:25:01.698
That hurts!

00:25:09.915 --> 00:25:11.166
My new home.

00:25:14.336 --> 00:25:15.629
Won’t they look for you?

00:25:15.837 --> 00:25:17.297
No, Mom knows.

00:25:17.297 --> 00:25:18.373
I told her.

00:25:18.506 --> 00:25:19.507
Wow.

00:25:19.966 --> 00:25:21.760
Of all the people who left home, you're
the only one who asked for permission.

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:22.444
Amazing.

00:25:22.469 --> 00:25:24.137
Of course—
so Mom knows where I’m going.

00:25:26.806 --> 00:25:28.279
Where are you even going to sleep?

00:25:28.642 --> 00:25:29.851
Angelo said in your room.

00:25:30.185 --> 00:25:31.353
My room?

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:33.897
- Do you want some?
- Yeah.

00:25:34.522 --> 00:25:36.233
Race you to your room!

00:25:36.233 --> 00:25:38.985
Idiot! No eating there!

00:25:38.985 --> 00:25:39.986
Hey!

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:41.076
Ci-N!

00:25:43.198 --> 00:25:45.951
[Ci-N singing]

00:25:53.833 --> 00:25:55.210
Ci-N!

00:26:10.141 --> 00:26:12.394
Good morning.

00:26:14.521 --> 00:26:17.440
Get up!
Your pillow is soaked with your drool.

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:30.078
Ci-N, you're so noisy!

00:26:30.078 --> 00:26:31.329
So early in the morning!

00:26:40.005 --> 00:26:40.714
I'll go ahead, Jay.

00:26:40.714 --> 00:26:41.798
Going downstairs to eat.

00:26:47.095 --> 00:26:49.848
Wow, feel at home.

00:27:00.358 --> 00:27:01.373
Ouch.

00:27:21.546 --> 00:27:23.173
Did Aries do something to you?

00:27:26.926 --> 00:27:29.054
What? What did he do?

00:27:33.975 --> 00:27:35.091
Let’s go.

00:27:35.143 --> 00:27:36.162
Huh?

00:27:49.282 --> 00:27:52.452
Ci, wait—talk to me.

00:27:52.994 --> 00:27:55.038
What did Aries do to you?

00:27:56.039 --> 00:27:57.107
Is it true, Jay?

00:27:57.415 --> 00:27:58.630
You’re leaving Section E?

00:28:00.377 --> 00:28:01.920
Did Aries tell you that?

00:28:02.879 --> 00:28:06.508
He said I should stay away
from you because you’re leaving.

00:28:07.884 --> 00:28:09.694
No, don’t stay away from me.

00:28:09.719 --> 00:28:11.679
- Crazy.
- Don’t listen to him.

00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:13.264
Who said that?

00:28:13.839 --> 00:28:15.299
Who said you'll leave Section E?

00:28:18.103 --> 00:28:18.912
Who's fighting?

00:28:18.937 --> 00:28:20.313
Is there a cockfight?

00:28:20.397 --> 00:28:22.565
Jay, you’re leaving Section E?

00:28:23.191 --> 00:28:24.667
No!

00:28:24.692 --> 00:28:26.361
But that’s what he said!

00:28:26.569 --> 00:28:28.655
Why would he say that?

00:28:28.947 --> 00:28:30.615
You don’t want to be with
us anymore, Jay?

00:28:30.657 --> 00:28:32.909
We can still tolerate your sour attitude.

00:28:32.992 --> 00:28:35.161
I thought we were solid Section E.

00:28:35.328 --> 00:28:37.580
- Ouch!
- Yeah.

00:28:37.789 --> 00:28:41.584
We thought nothing could break us.

00:28:41.793 --> 00:28:43.294
- Exactly.
- So dramatic!

00:28:43.294 --> 00:28:44.479
It’s not like that!

00:28:44.504 --> 00:28:45.513
Was it Aries?!

00:28:46.256 --> 00:28:47.841
Keifer, stop!

00:28:47.841 --> 00:28:50.552
Jay, don’t leave!
Stay in Section E!

00:28:50.552 --> 00:28:52.345
- Don’t leave!
- Ci, enough!

00:28:52.345 --> 00:28:53.863
- I don’t care!
- Jay, please don’t!!

00:28:53.888 --> 00:28:55.198
What is happening here?!

00:28:55.223 --> 00:28:56.975
Jay-jay is leaving Section E!

00:28:57.142 --> 00:28:58.268
- Stop!
- Jay, please!

00:28:58.268 --> 00:28:59.285
Is that true?

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:00.061
I’m not!

00:29:00.061 --> 00:29:01.896
Look—I’ll explain later!

00:29:01.896 --> 00:29:04.691
Go to Keifer first,
he might go after Aries! Hurry!

00:29:05.024 --> 00:29:06.860
- Ci, no one's leaving!
- Jay please please!

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:08.027
I’m not leaving!

00:29:09.571 --> 00:29:10.780
- So dramatic!
- Really?

00:29:11.021 --> 00:29:12.940
Yes! That's what I've been saying!

00:29:13.158 --> 00:29:14.367
Aries told me to choose:

00:29:14.367 --> 00:29:15.618
Either I leave Section E,

00:29:15.618 --> 00:29:17.454
or he won't give me
my Dad's number.

00:29:17.454 --> 00:29:20.165
But I chose you guys, okay?!
Happy now?!

00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:22.667
Let's go, we need to follow Keifer!

00:29:22.667 --> 00:29:23.710
Hurry!

00:29:23.751 --> 00:29:25.837
- Let’s go!
- I don’t want to! Why?

00:29:25.837 --> 00:29:27.505
Are you paying me for this?
I don't want to!

00:29:31.217 --> 00:29:32.263
Get up!

00:29:43.021 --> 00:29:44.037
Come here.

00:30:02.081 --> 00:30:03.541
Is that it, huh?!

00:30:10.465 --> 00:30:11.758
Let's go, quickly!

00:30:15.094 --> 00:30:16.846
What?
Let's finish this here now!

00:30:16.846 --> 00:30:17.764
Okay, let's end it here.

00:30:17.764 --> 00:30:18.640
Can someone stop them?!

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:21.267
Enough!
Stop it already!

00:30:21.518 --> 00:30:24.854
I guess the rumors are true,
it's really a mess here.

00:30:25.396 --> 00:30:27.690
Can those losers get out of here already?

00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:28.358
Especially you!

00:30:28.399 --> 00:30:31.027
Enough!
Don't you dare speak to Jay-jay like that!

00:30:31.236 --> 00:30:32.904
Jay-jay, you need to leave.

00:30:33.196 --> 00:30:35.169
Things are getting out of
control because of you.

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:40.130
As if.

00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:42.413
Stop it already, let's go.

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:44.290
Not until you swear!

00:30:44.457 --> 00:30:46.834
Swear in front of Aries,
you'll never leave us!

00:30:48.795 --> 00:30:50.004
Now!

00:30:54.552 --> 00:30:55.553
Sorry.

00:31:03.768 --> 00:31:05.103
I'm sorry, Aries.

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:09.816
I've said this before,
and I'll say it again.

00:31:11.317 --> 00:31:12.986
I'm not leaving Section E.

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:18.866
Yes!

00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:20.474
Won’t karma get you for that?

00:31:20.743 --> 00:31:22.161
That's your decision.

00:31:22.161 --> 00:31:24.163
I hope you won't regret it.

00:31:25.248 --> 00:31:27.542
You just lost your chance to
be with your father.

00:31:29.752 --> 00:31:30.962
So stupid!

00:31:33.089 --> 00:31:35.216
That's what you used to blackmail Jay-jay?

00:31:37.927 --> 00:31:39.429
Are you forgetting who I am?

00:31:39.721 --> 00:31:41.222
I always get what I want.

00:31:42.473 --> 00:31:43.521
Tss.

00:31:46.519 --> 00:31:47.145
Don't worry, Jay.

00:31:47.145 --> 00:31:49.522
I promise I'm gonna
connect you to your father.

00:32:19.302 --> 00:32:21.220
How did you know I was here?

00:32:21.811 --> 00:32:25.273
Uhh, Edrix said you're hanging out
here to get some air.

00:32:28.019 --> 00:32:30.813
It hasn't even been a week of classes,
yet you got into a fight already.

00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:37.278
My hands hurt.

00:32:38.237 --> 00:32:39.405
Do it for me.

00:32:48.956 --> 00:32:49.932
Ouch!

00:32:49.957 --> 00:32:51.167
Be gentle!

00:32:51.918 --> 00:32:54.545
Who told you to get into a fight then?

00:32:55.004 --> 00:32:56.339
Always losing your temper.

00:33:02.679 --> 00:33:03.705
I'm sorry.

00:33:06.307 --> 00:33:09.686
Wow!
You're getting good at apologizing, huh.

00:33:09.977 --> 00:33:10.895
"I'm sorry".
Say it one more time.

00:33:10.895 --> 00:33:12.480
One more, come on.
One more time.

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:13.773
Stop making fun of me.

00:33:13.898 --> 00:33:15.233
I only apologize to you.

00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:17.318
Why just me?

00:33:17.318 --> 00:33:20.154
I'm sure you've got a long list of people
you need to apologize to.

00:33:20.154 --> 00:33:22.073
Who's first?
Aries, and then—

00:33:22.073 --> 00:33:23.199
I don't care.

00:33:23.533 --> 00:33:25.451
I don't have feelings for any of them.

00:33:26.327 --> 00:33:27.412
Only for you.

00:33:40.967 --> 00:33:42.049
Whatever!

00:33:45.596 --> 00:33:47.014
Please stay.

00:33:56.107 --> 00:33:57.859
Please stay.

00:33:58.234 --> 00:33:59.252
Keifer…

00:34:07.243 --> 00:34:08.911
I'm not giving up on you, Jay.

00:34:12.665 --> 00:34:14.250
I'll fight for you.

00:34:28.055 --> 00:34:29.515
What kind of dream was that?

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:34.562
That didn't happen,
but it felt so real.

00:34:36.063 --> 00:34:38.608
Enough, Jay-jay!

00:34:44.605 --> 00:34:47.149
Good morning, Jay! See you.

00:34:57.543 --> 00:34:58.572
Ci-N?

00:34:58.596 --> 00:35:08.596
(Watch on www.dramacool.club Support Admin)

00:35:14.852 --> 00:35:16.037
I went ahead, Jay!

00:35:16.062 --> 00:35:18.439
You’re impossible to wake,
you just kept on groaning.

00:35:19.482 --> 00:35:20.525
Shit!

00:35:23.694 --> 00:35:25.655
That brat's really gonna get
it from me later.

00:35:27.532 --> 00:35:29.242
He actually left me?

00:35:29.242 --> 00:35:31.260
And even brought my bike with him!

00:35:34.494 --> 00:35:36.541
- What?
- Looks like you're late too.

00:35:36.916 --> 00:35:39.335
I woke up late,
how about you?

00:35:39.502 --> 00:35:40.962
I woke up late, too.

00:35:41.712 --> 00:35:42.922
Okay, let's go.

00:35:46.384 --> 00:35:47.401
What’s with you?

00:35:47.426 --> 00:35:48.427
Don’t look back.

00:35:48.594 --> 00:35:50.221
- Why?
- Someone's following us.

00:35:51.389 --> 00:35:53.683
Wait, don't look.

00:35:54.482 --> 00:35:55.511
What?

00:35:58.437 --> 00:35:59.522
Call Keifer.

00:35:59.856 --> 00:36:00.863
Huh?

00:36:02.108 --> 00:36:03.136
Quickly.

00:36:03.359 --> 00:36:04.371
Wait, wait.

00:36:12.827 --> 00:36:14.203
There's the girl.

00:36:14.203 --> 00:36:15.413
Jay, run!

00:36:16.455 --> 00:36:17.348
Hey!

00:36:17.373 --> 00:36:19.750
Jay-jay, I told you to leave,
why are you still here?

00:36:20.668 --> 00:36:21.752
Jay, leave!

00:36:23.838 --> 00:36:24.922
The girl!

00:36:28.009 --> 00:36:29.594
I won't leave you alone here!

00:36:34.682 --> 00:36:36.267
Go!

00:36:39.353 --> 00:36:40.313
Are you okay?

00:36:40.313 --> 00:36:42.189
I'm good, are you okay?

00:36:43.566 --> 00:36:44.901
What was that?!

00:36:48.905 --> 00:36:50.865
You thought you won already?

00:36:50.865 --> 00:36:52.332
That's just a hint of what's about to come.

00:36:52.533 --> 00:36:53.659
What do you need from us?

00:36:54.368 --> 00:36:55.536
Her.

00:36:56.162 --> 00:36:58.055
We know she's Keifer's girlfriend.

00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:00.541
Huh?! He's not my boyfriend!

00:37:00.541 --> 00:37:02.627
He said it so himself that
we're not in a relationship!

00:37:03.169 --> 00:37:05.004
Do you think we'll believe you?

00:37:06.088 --> 00:37:08.424
Jay, we need to escape them.

00:37:08.799 --> 00:37:09.483
How?

00:37:09.508 --> 00:37:12.845
Just surrender Keifer's girlfriend
to us so it's over with.

00:37:13.054 --> 00:37:14.055
This guy's annoying.

00:37:14.055 --> 00:37:16.515
Insist it all you want,
I'm not his girlfriend!

00:37:17.725 --> 00:37:20.353
And it'll be a bigger mess
if I give her to you.

00:37:23.189 --> 00:37:24.253
Jay!

00:37:36.619 --> 00:37:38.204
We’ll go ahead.

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:52.472
Where are you?

00:37:53.177 --> 00:37:55.554
Why do I feel like something is wrong?

00:38:11.484 --> 00:38:13.355
Were you able to contact her?

00:38:22.621 --> 00:38:24.709
You don't have to hide it from me.

00:38:25.001 --> 00:38:26.127
I already know.

00:38:26.585 --> 00:38:28.587
I'm saying this so it's clear…

00:38:29.088 --> 00:38:30.339
I'm not backing down.

00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:33.009
Even if we're engaged already?

00:38:33.384 --> 00:38:34.677
I don't care.

00:38:34.969 --> 00:38:36.554
Let Jay-jay decide.

00:38:36.929 --> 00:38:38.816
I'll only stop when she tells me to.

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:51.652
Why is Jay-jay still not here?

00:38:52.778 --> 00:38:54.280
Do you know where she is?

00:38:54.822 --> 00:38:55.715
No.

00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:57.199
Keifer!

00:38:57.658 --> 00:38:59.869
The tracker shows Jay-jay
is in the hospital.

00:39:01.078 --> 00:39:02.079
What?!

00:39:07.293 --> 00:39:08.627
Drix, go!

00:39:10.546 --> 00:39:11.756
What?!

00:39:12.173 --> 00:39:14.592
Boys, over here!

00:39:22.266 --> 00:39:23.517
Where are you Jay?

00:39:23.684 --> 00:39:24.935
I'm going crazy.

00:39:26.979 --> 00:39:29.023
Miss, is there a Jasper
Jean Mariano here?

00:39:29.023 --> 00:39:30.566
Wait Sir, I'll check.

00:39:31.817 --> 00:39:33.110
Faster, Miss!

00:39:33.527 --> 00:39:34.503
I don't have time!

00:39:34.528 --> 00:39:36.072
Sir, there's no Jasper
Jean Mariano admitted here.

00:39:36.072 --> 00:39:37.698
- Huh?
- What time was she admitted?

00:39:37.698 --> 00:39:40.576
A while ago, check it again!
Faster!

00:39:40.743 --> 00:39:41.660
Sorry Sir, but there's—

00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:43.704
Miss, check it again please.

00:39:44.872 --> 00:39:46.332
Guys, here!

00:39:47.958 --> 00:39:48.980
Jay!

00:39:50.902 --> 00:39:51.754
Jay, I’m coming.

00:39:51.754 --> 00:39:53.422
Good thing the wound isn't that deep.

00:39:53.422 --> 00:39:57.134
You shouldn't be lifting
heavy things for one week.

00:40:05.267 --> 00:40:06.727
Where's Jay-jay?

00:40:10.356 --> 00:40:11.824
She was right there a while ago.

00:40:12.599 --> 00:40:14.810
She disappeared all of a sudden,
she was probably shocked by all the blood.

00:40:15.444 --> 00:40:16.570
What did you say?

00:40:16.904 --> 00:40:17.571
I don't know, bro.

00:40:17.571 --> 00:40:20.324
She just started shaking
when she saw me bleeding.

00:40:20.616 --> 00:40:22.660
She didn't talk...

00:40:23.244 --> 00:40:24.453
she just kept on crying.

00:40:24.495 --> 00:40:25.503
Fuck.

00:40:25.871 --> 00:40:28.415
Ever since Ram's gang weakened,

00:40:28.958 --> 00:40:30.709
everyone popped out of nowhere.

00:40:30.709 --> 00:40:32.920
And they all want to get Jay-jay

00:40:34.171 --> 00:40:35.923
because she's Keifer's girlfriend.

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:38.847
I don't even know.

00:40:39.093 --> 00:40:42.429
I'm just grateful that
David came to help us.

00:40:43.389 --> 00:40:45.975
If it wasn't for him,
we wouldn't even reach the hospital.

00:40:47.434 --> 00:40:49.228
Rory, your coffee.

00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:57.111
Next time, call me.

00:40:57.111 --> 00:40:59.196
Don't try to be a fucking hero.

00:41:13.544 --> 00:41:14.558
Hello?

00:41:15.303 --> 00:41:16.472
How is she?

00:41:17.173 --> 00:41:19.383
She looked terrified
when I found them.

00:41:19.842 --> 00:41:22.261
With all that blood,
I thought it was her who got stabbed.

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:24.555
But she was just hugging Rory.

00:41:24.763 --> 00:41:26.348
Why did this happen?

00:41:26.849 --> 00:41:30.060
What stupid shit did Keifer do this time
for Jay-jay to get involved again?

00:41:30.728 --> 00:41:33.981
They all want to use
Jay-jay to beat Keifer.

00:41:34.398 --> 00:41:35.433
Huh?

00:41:35.691 --> 00:41:37.902
Keifer never uses his head!

00:41:39.026 --> 00:41:42.082
So, what's your plan?

00:41:42.823 --> 00:41:44.158
None yet.

00:41:44.158 --> 00:41:48.204
But when I get back,
they better prepare themselves.

00:42:00.466 --> 00:42:02.092
Why?

00:42:02.218 --> 00:42:04.470
Why didn't I black out?

00:42:05.179 --> 00:42:09.099
Why didn't I attack them
like how I did to Cyrus and Ram?

00:42:11.685 --> 00:42:14.188
A lot has happened ever since
I wore this uniform.

00:42:14.188 --> 00:42:16.106
Stop it!

00:42:16.941 --> 00:42:20.152
Stop it!

00:42:26.450 --> 00:42:30.829
But among all of them,
this one's the worst.

00:42:37.836 --> 00:42:39.672
Jay!

00:42:46.845 --> 00:42:48.347
Keifer…

00:42:49.431 --> 00:42:50.724
No, no.

00:42:51.225 --> 00:42:54.061
Don't cry.

00:42:54.061 --> 00:42:56.772
I'm here, don't cry.

00:42:57.815 --> 00:42:59.526
Please don't cry, I'm here.

00:43:07.408 --> 00:43:10.494
Don't cry, it's okay.

00:43:10.661 --> 00:43:11.662
I'm here.

00:43:11.954 --> 00:43:12.963
Don't cry.

00:43:13.539 --> 00:43:15.165
It's okay.

00:43:22.923 --> 00:43:24.550
Is this your blood?

00:43:24.925 --> 00:43:26.302
Are you hurt?

00:43:27.678 --> 00:43:28.768
No.

00:43:30.389 --> 00:43:33.267
I thought the same incident
with Ram would happen again.

00:43:34.018 --> 00:43:35.690
I was scared.

00:43:36.145 --> 00:43:38.063
It's okay, everything's okay.

00:43:38.147 --> 00:43:39.315
Everything’s okay.

00:43:39.732 --> 00:43:40.816
Stop crying.

00:43:42.276 --> 00:43:43.210
It's okay.

00:43:43.235 --> 00:43:45.654
I saw lots of blood

00:43:46.238 --> 00:43:50.034
but I didn't faint nor harm anyone.

00:43:50.385 --> 00:43:52.411
And we'll figure out why.

00:43:53.954 --> 00:43:57.750
But for now,
let's get you cleaned up.

00:43:58.307 --> 00:44:01.754
I know this is wrong because
Yuri's my fiancé already.

00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:06.425
But why do I feel this way?

00:44:07.092 --> 00:44:09.011
When it comes to Keifer,

00:44:09.553 --> 00:44:11.764
my feelings are certain.

00:44:25.319 --> 00:44:27.988
Wait, what are you going to do?

00:44:28.739 --> 00:44:30.157
You need rest.

00:44:30.157 --> 00:44:31.825
Just shut up and let me.

00:45:28.715 --> 00:45:32.386
I'm not giving up on you, Jay.

00:45:35.764 --> 00:45:37.182
I'll fight for you.

00:45:41.478 --> 00:45:43.147
Is this still a dream?

00:45:43.856 --> 00:45:45.899
Shit, someone wake me up!

00:45:47.192 --> 00:45:48.861
Game on.

00:46:52.674 --> 00:46:54.843
Don’t just let them take what’s yours.

00:46:55.029 --> 00:46:57.031
Just because they dared
to make a bold move.

00:47:01.135 --> 00:47:02.009
Follow your heart.

00:47:02.034 --> 00:47:04.648
Don't listen to distractions
and don't give them an inch.

00:47:04.673 --> 00:47:06.007
Were you the one who taught them?

00:47:06.188 --> 00:47:08.857
Out of all the boys in Section E,
five of us can do Martial Arts.

00:47:08.957 --> 00:47:10.907
Six if you include Mayo too.

00:47:10.932 --> 00:47:11.860
Oh "kapour"!

00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:14.696
- "Kapour!"
- Parkour!

00:47:14.696 --> 00:47:15.364
You said "kapour"!

00:47:15.364 --> 00:47:16.715
Stupid, it's parkour!

00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:18.116
If I'm the stupid one,
then what are you?

00:47:18.116 --> 00:47:18.742
Attention-seeker!

00:47:18.742 --> 00:47:19.368
Asshole!

00:47:19.368 --> 00:47:20.471
Profanity.

00:47:23.872 --> 00:47:25.207
I'm jealous.

00:47:25.457 --> 00:47:27.042
I can't help it, Jay.

00:47:27.042 --> 00:47:29.503
You agreed to be my fiancée.

00:47:34.316 --> 00:47:35.734
Fuck, it's because of Jay-jay?!

00:47:35.759 --> 00:47:36.876
Wait, no!

00:47:36.901 --> 00:47:37.678
It isn't what it looks like!

00:47:37.678 --> 00:47:38.971
Kit!

00:47:38.971 --> 00:47:40.339
Even blaming Kit!

00:47:40.364 --> 00:47:42.283
Stop talking to Jay-jay like that!

00:47:42.349 --> 00:47:45.727
Go flirt with everybody in Section E!

00:47:46.566 --> 00:47:48.807
You're no different from Ella,
anyway!
