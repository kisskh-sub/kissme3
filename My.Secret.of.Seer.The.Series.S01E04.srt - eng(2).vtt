Sure, no problem.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.040
Is it urgent?

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.080
I'll send you the files tonight.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.936
Okay. I'll make sure
I send them to you tonight.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:34.960
Hey.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.920
Are you aware that
bad luck is coming your way?

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.400
Sorry, I'll get back to you.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.440
What do you mean by that?

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.400
Someone in your family
will suffer serious misfortune.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.000
Is there a way out of this,
fortune teller?

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.920
What do you mean?

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.520
You can't look after my dad for me?

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.560
I already have,

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.960
but I have my own work to do, too.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.680
I get that,

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.960
but do you know what time it is?

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.920
Why don't you

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.560
hire an actual caretaker
for your dad?

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.960
I'm your boyfriend, remember?

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.760
I only stopped by a shrine
for a minute or two.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.200
I'm heading home soon.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.360
What nonsense
are you talking about?

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.400
Stop believing in
those ridiculous ideas.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:36.600
Job.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.480
Yes?

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.800
Have you prepared
for the shooting location yet?

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.720
Yes, I have.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.840
Mm.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:43.880
Get to work, then.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.640
Understood.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.440
Win.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.000
Nokphaeng absolutely enjoyed
your last night's livestream.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.280
He says you have
a naive, sweet personality,

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.760
and that Phloeng knows
how to get people engaged, too.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.359
Our show's rating
is going to shoot up

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.920
to the moon at this rate.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.400
It's "their" show.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.680
What do you mean it's ours?

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.680
Right. It's whatever,

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.120
but we're both getting paid

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.640
and growing a fan base.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.200
We'll then have passive income.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.600
See that, Win?

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.360
I think our luck
is at an all-time high.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.440
Every card you see
will be a Pentacle,

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.280
guaranteed by yours truly.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.840
You're saying that
in my bad luck year,

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.640
when a potted plant
almost killed me on the spot?

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.640
Hey, guys!

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.920
Someone bought our whole stock.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.560
We have to celebrate
the success, right?

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.000
Later.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.760
When is my last client?

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.440
Hold on.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.920
It's May next year.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.400
I'm going to pass out.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.040
Come on.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.920
Just stick to your goals.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.880
You should also inform your clients.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.440
I think they'll get it.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.880
Just stick to ten clients per day,
for funsies.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.800
(Tul: Schedule Win a meeting for me.
(It's about the show)

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.200
By the way, Namo,

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.560
when is the next show's recording?

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.440
This Friday.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.920
Okay, a two-day rest
is better than nothing.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.320
Oh, right...

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.920
I've got to go now.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.600
What?

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.640
Where are you going?

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.120
A secret.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.000
See you.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.680
Judging from how you dress,
it must be a date.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.560
I'm wearing all black.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.920
I'm attending a funeral, damn it.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.440
Be seeing you.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.400
Oh, I almost forgot.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.840
I'm coming home a bit late tonight.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:11.880
Bye.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.920
Oh, Win...

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.240
I forgot to tell you something.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.360
You have a meeting with Tul today.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.520
Thank you.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.680
Hello, Tul.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.560
Hello, Master.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.600
Please take a seat.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.840
Uh...

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.920
Why do you call me
for a meeting today?

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.960
Is it about the livestream?

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.080
That's right.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.120
I've done a live show
as you told me.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.400
How was it?

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.920
The reception was amazing.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.800
You looked so natural.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.480
Is it a good thing?

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.160
It is.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:23.920
That's lovely.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.400
What are you saying, Tul?

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.800
I was just doing my work.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.280
Doing so much reading in one go

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.120
is very exhausting, though.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.600
Is it, Master?

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.320
I'm really sorry.
I never knew that.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.920
Oh, it's totally fine.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:43.920
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.520
- Enjoy, Master.
- Thank you.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.680
Is that

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.240
an injury from that day?

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.080
Oh...

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.720
It is.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.080
No need to worry, though.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.640
It's nothing serious.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.040
Just a second.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.560
Yes?

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:14.440
Here.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.480
Let me change it up.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:17.880
Sure.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.400
Thank you.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.880
It's me who has to thank you

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.400
for saving me on that day.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:52.720
Look at you.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.360
You got hurt because of me.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:56.800
It's totally fine.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.560
Uh...

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.560
I think we should dig in.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.640
- Right.
- Enjoy.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.880
How is it? Is it good?

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:12.960
It is.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.680
- This way.
- Thank you.

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:35.160
Thank you very much, Tul,

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.200
for treating me to this meal.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.600
Don't mention it.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.320
It's me who has to thank you.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.240
You helped make my show go viral.

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:43.920
Right.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.400
If that's everything,

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.920
I'm bidding you farewell.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.920
Should I drive you home?

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.640
Well...

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.360
It's okay.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.920
Don't let me stop you
from your work.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.040
Sure.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:06.520
Well then...

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.920
Let's do this again sometime.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Sure.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.680
- I'll be seeing you soon.
- Right.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.640
Aww...

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.360
You're beaming, Win.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.920
Who's beaming, Toh?

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.200
And where have you been?

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:26.760
Been seeing a girl?

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:29.880
It's just the usual.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.640
I've been wandering
around where I died.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.400
You knew that

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.840
I rode my motorbike

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.560
and got cut to death by wires.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.400
My skull was completely exposed.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.520
The temple is as far as I can go.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.440
I don't want to go there, however.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.440
The ghosts there always torment me.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.920
What are you doing here?
Are you lonely?

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.120
I'm not.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.560
You're free tomorrow.

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.280
Please make merit for me.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.480
I'm hungry.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.640
Sure, I'll do that just for you.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.200
I'm kind of wealthy now.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.320
You are?

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.560
If so...

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:11.920
Can you do me a favor?

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:13.920
I want to see

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.920
a stripper

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:17.920
with big breasts?

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.920
My reincarnation can wait.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:23.360
I'm so thirsty for them right now.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.776
- You're such a pervert, Toh.
- Ow!

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.720
I wasn't talking
about someone else's, you know?

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.720
- I'm talking about your breasts.
- Hey!

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.120
Ouch!

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.360
How can someone be
this adorable talking to himself?

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:58.760
What?

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.920
You promised me
you'd take me there.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.680
You're always like this.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.640
Your excuse is work? Again?

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.360
Have you ever kept your promises?

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.880
Oh, so you're saying
I'm in the wrong?

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.920
We're done talking, then.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.440
Oh?

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.480
Job!

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.480
Oh, Master.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:40.360
What...

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.200
What brings you here?

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.640
Oh, I'm on my way to a market

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:45.840
to get an offering.

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:48.440
Why, though?

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.560
My dad's sick.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.160
My mom visited a fortune teller.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.040
She was told
to get an offering for the shrine.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.560
I've tried everything,

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.520
from doctors to superstitions,

00:11:58.560 --> 00:11:59.880
just like Chai said.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.640
My dad is still doing fine, though.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:03.880
Would you like to come with me?

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:06.640
Are you sure?

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.520
Why are we stopping here, Job?

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.240
We're in the middle of the woods.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:33.480
To make an offering to the shrine.

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:34.640
There.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:38.640
Shit...

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.440
It's situated
at a three-way junction.

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.400
Mm, that's right.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:52.960
Let's get it done
before it gets dark.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:54.600
Sure.

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.000
I was told to place
the offering in front of the shrine

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.520
and put some incense on the food.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.320
How many?

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:16.760
A single incense stick.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.400
Shit...

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:19.776
These are for ghosts, I'm sure.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.640
Huh? What was that?

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.320
Nothing.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.560
She told me that once I was done,

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.480
I should turn around
and leave immediately.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.360
Let's just get this done.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:31.640
Okay.

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.000
Can I ask you a question?

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.240
Why do we need to hurry?

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.600
Just do as I said.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:01.960
Okay.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.080
Master...

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Is there a problem?

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.200
I think I might've left
my phone by the shrine.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.360
Damn it.

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:21.920
And...

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.680
Is it that important?

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:25.040
Of course, it is, Master.

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:26.480
It's my phone.

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:27.880
You're right.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.400
Here's the plan.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.400
I'll fetch it for you.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.160
Sure.

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:52.800
(Husband)

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:03.280
Go away!

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.880
Remember me?

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:06.960
I don't know who you are!

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:19.320
Job!

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:20.360
Here's your phone.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.320
Master?

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:26.800
Are you coming back?

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.320
Why have you gone silent?

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.000
Do you really think
you can do anything to me?

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:33.640
Don't think that
being with a highly virtuous soul

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:35.480
would protect you from me.

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.640
Fucking tell me who you are

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:39.920
and what you want!

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.440
I'll never tell you.

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.200
Master!

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.240
Master Win!

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:46.600
I'm right here.

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:48.760
Phloeng?

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.400
That's Phloeng's voice.

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:00.360
Are you good, Master?

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:05.520
I hurt my knee.

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:08.040
What trouble
did you just get yourself into?

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.840
I forgot my phone at the shrine,

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:12.240
so I asked him to get it for me.

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:15.320
Here.

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:16.600
Thank you very much.

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:18.840
Can you walk?

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.360
No need to carry me, Phloeng.

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:23.520
Who says that I will?

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.360
You were about to do that.

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:28.920
Has all the card reading
made you lose your mind?

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:31.520
Fine, I guess.

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.640
I'm not going to ask you to do that.

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.040
I'd better call Tul.

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.640
Let me escort you to your condo.

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:40.360
I can go home by myself.

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:48.800
Fine...

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:50.720
Get me home.

00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:58.440
Fuck...

00:17:58.520 --> 00:17:59.560
I'm screwed.

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.640
I turned and looked at the shrine.

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.240
Goddammit.

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:19.880
No matter how many times,

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:21.640
you always end up getting hurt.

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:25.400
It's not like I want
to get hurt, you know.

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:28.400
Next time I see you get hurt again,

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.400
I'll take it as a sign
you're hitting on me.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:34.760
Nonsense.

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.280
You're actually quite heavy, Master.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:42.760
If that's the case,

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.560
you can just put me down.

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:45.720
I can walk.

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:51.800
How can I let you go?

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.440
I'm going to take your body.

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.560
I can't do anything to you for now,

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:06.960
but the ones around you

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.040
will all be dead.

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:20.640
Are you alright?

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:22.920
Yes.

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.360
Did we arrive a while ago?

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:34.520
Yes.

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.120
You were sleeping,

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:37.680
so I didn't want to wake you.

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:50.200
You should see a doctor, Master.

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.360
Oh, it's fine.

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:56.680
I've got a medical kit in my room.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.440
Thank you for driving me home.

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:11.520
Would you like
to get a drink in my room first?

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.440
That'd be nice.

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.480
I can walk, actually.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:38.920
I wouldn't get a drink

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:40.480
if I let you walk
on your own, would I?

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:42.320
Win.

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:45.360
Yes?

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:46.960
What happened to your leg?

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.440
Why is it in this state?

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:50.680
I fell over.

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.680
- Oh.
- So my colleague drove me here.

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:54.720
It's a relief that you're fine.

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:57.640
I've heard that
you're employed, aren't you?

00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:00.200
You didn't tell me about that
when you came to my room.

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:01.920
- I'm so happy for you.
- Right.

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:03.680
Thank you.

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:06.360
By the way,
my door's is locked again.

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:07.720
Can you help me with that?

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.320
I'll look into that for you.

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.800
Please hang tight, okay?

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:12.320
Sure thing.

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.280
(Tul: Are you back in your room?)

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:21.880
Oh?

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:23.320
Where did she go?

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.640
Let me take care of
the door first, okay?

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:32.920
Sure.

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.000
It hasn't broken down or anything.

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:07.120
Hey!

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:08.240
Chakart!

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:10.280
Chakart...

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:11.520
Chakart!

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:12.920
Hey!

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.200
Phloeng...

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.440
What do we do?

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:18.520
Calm down, Win.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.080
I'm going to call the police.

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.240
Hello.

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:29.000
Someone's found dead

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:30.040
in a condo.

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:31.680
Please come here right now.

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:33.720
Right.

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:38.960
Is it true, Win?

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.400
As soon as the water recedes,
I'll rush to you.

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:42.920
No need, Waew.

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:45.600
Don't cross the water.
It's dangerous.

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:48.400
Moreover, she's already passed.

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:50.960
You returning here
won't change anything.

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:55.320
I think we simply help her
in ways that we can.

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.120
How is it going on your end?

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:09.280
The police assume that

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:11.560
she had acute heart failure.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.440
She passed away over six hours ago.

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:19.920
Still, it's very strange.

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.720
None of the security cameras
are working.

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.400
She must've met a peaceful end.

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:30.280
Waew...

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:32.560
Once everything's over,

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.400
please rush back to me, okay?

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:36.600
I think something is not right.

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:11.520
Thank you for walking me to my car.

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:14.000
Please get some rest.

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:21.960
Yes?

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:33.120
Phloeng, for this scene,
you need to sit in the tub.

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:35.400
It's a scene
where you'll be meditating.

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.880
I need to face
the camera B, correct?

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:39.120
Yes, sit...

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:41.656
- Sit on the right, the camera's right.
- Would you like a drink?

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:42.680
Give us a moment.

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:43.880
Okay.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:47.960
Want a drink?

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:50.520
You're scared of ghosts?

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:53.640
No, the smoke is hurting my eyes.

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.480
So, a drink or no?

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:00.600
Yes, please.

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:13.680
Get in the car.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:17.600
And...

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.176
If you're afraid of ghosts tonight,

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.400
stay in my room, okay?

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:46.840
Has your leg gotten better now?

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:49.760
It's gotten way better now.

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:52.240
Wait here, okay?

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:54.960
Cause no trouble, alright?

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:22.840
What are you doing, Phloeng?

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:24.080
Stay still.

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.440
I can do it myself, you know?

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:37.560
Don't move.

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.320
I don't want to bother you.

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:43.360
Let me do it myself.

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.680
If you don't want to bother me,

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:47.480
be careful next time.

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.720
I tried, you see.

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:53.400
Then why did you fall over?

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:56.320
You won't get it.

00:26:58.800 --> 00:26:59.800
And...

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:01.280
What don't I get?

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:03.720
If you don't believe in ghosts,

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:06.480
then why are you
making a living off of them?

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:11.680
Well, it makes me a ton of money.

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:14.840
I thought
I was going to do it just for fun,

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:17.800
but after a while, people started
enjoying the content,

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:19.560
which earned me a fortune.

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.920
We all love money, don't we?

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:25.920
I see.

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:27.800
But...

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:29.520
Don't you feel uncomfortable?

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:32.760
You're a host of a ghost show
who doesn't believe in ghosts,

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.920
and here you are,
making a career out of them.

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:38.840
Well...

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:40.600
I see it

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.520
as listening to horror fiction.

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:44.680
But what they told you

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.800
wasn't fictional, Phloeng.

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:49.800
How can you be sure

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.160
that it wasn't just fantasy?

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:54.480
Ghosts are real.

00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:58.480
If they are,

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.360
show them to me, Master.

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:15.920
Excuse me...

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:25.640
What are you looking at?

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.200
Do you want to make merit?

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.480
Are you asking me to go on a date?

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:34.560
Not that.

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:36.920
I accept.

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:39.440
Just tell me the date, okay?

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:55.680
Excuse me...

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.640
Hey, Yok...

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:02.640
Uh...

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.720
I still can't bring myself
to tell your father about you.

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:12.800
I'm afraid that he'd get mad.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.680
He won't. He's a kind man.

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:18.680
How about this?

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:20.800
I'm taking your father
to make merit.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.960
He'll make merit for you.

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:24.960
I'll get to do it for you as well.

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.560
We'll make a lot of merit for you.

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:29.880
I'll also offer you dolls, toys,

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:31.920
and tasty treats.

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:35.000
This way, you'll receive
both merit and toys.

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:36.240
Is that okay?

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:38.480
I accept your offer!

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:12.720
(Tul: Master, are you okay?)

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.080
(Tul: You're probably busy, right?)

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:16.840
(Tul: Leaving me on read?
(Good night, then)

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:33.360
Hello, Master.

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:35.080
Do you feel better now?

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:36.920
I'm alright.

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:39.120
You're still awake, Tul?

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:41.560
I am.

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:43.280
I'm actually at the office.

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:45.920
You should get some rest.

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:47.680
You go and get some rest, Master.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.200
Rest well, okay?

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:51.120
We've got a show
to work on tomorrow.

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:52.920
Right.

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:08.320
How is he?

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:12.640
You...

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:16.920
Are you two still friends?

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:18.760
Of course, we are.

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:21.680
Why did you ask me that?

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:24.680
You seem like
you don't care about him at all.

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:26.640
It's not that I don't.

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:29.920
He says that
he doesn't want to see anybody.

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:32.640
Also, you called me here.

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.240
I'm no longer interested in you.

00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:58.840
I'm going to claim Win as mine.

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:04.400
Good for you.

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:07.240
You're actually not that hot,
you know?

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:39.400
And you said
you're no longer interested in me.

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:43.920
Come on in.

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:53.720
Whoa! Phloeng!

00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:56.920
Why did you open the door
without pants on?

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:58.200
What?

00:33:58.360 --> 00:33:59.360
Who would've known?

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:02.600
I didn't know that
you were barely dressed.

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:04.920
Is that so?

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:07.120
I thought you wanted
to look at my chest,

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:08.520
so I opened the door.

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:10.720
It's not like that.

00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:16.360
You...

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:17.920
You actually looked?

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:20.560
I...

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.040
Go and wait downstairs.

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:30.640
I'll cook something for you.

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:32.600
I just want

00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:35.200
a cup of instant noodles
and hot water.

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:36.680
Gosh...

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.680
I don't have junk food like that.

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:53.560
Here you go.

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:04.000
You can go and rest.

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:05.600
I'll wash the dish myself.

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:07.440
Whoa.

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:09.200
You're dismissing me
after getting the food?

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:11.000
I'm not.

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:13.040
It's almost two in the morning.

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:15.480
I've already caused you trouble
for the whole day.

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:17.680
It's fine.

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:19.280
I'll just play
video games while I wait.

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:48.920
Thank you

00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:51.320
for letting me stay here.

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:54.160
Right.

00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:58.840
Do you think

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:00.720
it's because of my bad luck year?

00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:03.600
If it's your bad luck year,

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:06.000
how come someone else died?

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:08.720
You've got a point.

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:11.880
People die every day.

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:14.360
As for your bad luck year...

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:16.360
It's just you turning 25.

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:18.360
I'm 26 now.

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:22.080
Then why are you worried
about having a bad luck year?

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:25.960
Venerable Father said

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.400
my bad luck year started
when I turned 26.

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:32.600
It's not considered
a bad luck year, then.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.200
We believe that
it happens at the age of 25.

00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:37.640
I'm done arguing with you.

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:05.480
Done?

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:07.440
You're still awake?

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:09.720
I was waiting for you.

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:21.360
Good night.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:23.240
Likewise.

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:38.000
With this strong energy,

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:39.640
how am I supposed to fall asleep?

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:48.200
Everything happens

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:49.240
because of you?

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:57.640
What do you want?

00:37:58.040 --> 00:37:59.200
My life?

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:04.600
Fine.

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:05.920
Gone quiet?

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:13.200
You'll die eventually.

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:15.000
If I have to die,

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:17.280
then you're coming with me!

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:32.360
Whoa, Yok!

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:35.376
Don't show up and sit
at the end of the bed like this.

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:37.240
You woke up late.

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:41.960
Your father's room
is extremely chilly.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.000
And...

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:46.560
Where is your father?

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:16.640
I don't understand the reading.

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:20.360
However, when The Tower
and The Ten of Swords appear together,

00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:22.680
something bad is bound to happen.

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:48.320
(I'm off for work.

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:52.040
Simply reheat the breakfast
I've prepared for you.

00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:53.320
See you.
(From Phloengnathitorn)

00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:58.280
Phloeng?

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:01.200
Dry your hair first,

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:02.240
or you'll catch a cold.

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:03.720
I'll be fine.

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:05.160
I'm in a hurry.

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:06.360
I'll be off soon.

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:08.640
Thank you very much

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.760
for allowing me
to spend a night here.

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:12.360
We'll leave together.

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:14.480
We've got a meeting together.

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:17.360
Right.

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:19.080
Go blow-dry your hair.

00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:33.120
What's that noise?

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:38.040
Is it a ghost?

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:41.400
Alright...

00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:15.200
Luck hasn't been
on your side, has it?

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:20.360
Me?

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:39.440
About Win...

00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:40.960
Should I confess my love to him?

00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:43.056
This time,
we're shooting outside the city.

00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.056
However, we don't know
what province we'll be going to.

00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:46.200
This trip of yours...

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:47.360
You will not make it back.

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:50.600
Yesterday, it was Chakart.

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:51.840
Today, it's the housekeeper.

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:53.336
There's no place
to cremate bodies at this rate.

00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:54.960
What the hell are you doing?

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.600
It's for dealing
with my karmic creditor.

00:41:58.120 --> 00:41:59.480
Please let me be yours.

00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:01.840
Hatred ceases
by smashing it to bits!

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:03.760
You have nothing left.

00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:05.200
I think...

00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:06.720
I've found my karmic creditor.

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:15.200
Is it the work of destiny or fate?

00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:22.920
I have no choice but to accept it

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:32.040
I've tried so hard,
but it's impossible to run away

00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:37.880
I have to accept that
things are here to stay

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:44.520
I've always thought that
love was just a ruse

00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:51.880
I've never thought that
my true love would be you
