[Reborn from the Ashes]

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.440
[Episode 4]

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.760
Welcome the eldest daughter back home.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.180
Doesn't the Su Family already
have an eldest daughter?

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.440
Then who is this newcomer?

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.440
Maybe she's a fraud.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.840
She must be after the Su Family's
wealth and honor.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.510
My father raised me in the countryside
since I was young.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.670
He feels deeply remorseful about it.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.590
This good luck is for everyone to share.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.230
One petal

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.840
for one coin.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.110
Collect as many as you can

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.230
and then bring them

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.360
to my mansion to exchange
with my father.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.710
Come and share some good luck.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.710
One petal for one coin!

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.440
Collect silver coins from Master Su.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.190
The show

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.230
is about to begin.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.920
Master!

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.150
Master!

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.150
Why are you in such a hurry?

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:06.320
There's someone outside

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.690
claiming to be the legitimate daughter
of Su Family.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:10.510
The legitimate daughter?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.030
Master,

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.510
looks like Qingran has come back.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.230
Then come back.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.480
What's the big deal about it?

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.840
But she brought a crowd of people
with her

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.280
to ask you for auspicious gifts.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.400
Each one holds a flower petal in hand.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:27.840
They say one petal

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.280
can be exchanged for one coin.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:30.710
What?

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.030
They want silver coins?

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.230
A crowd of people?

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.510
The lady and those people have been
strolling the streets all day.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.460
They strolled back and forth
four or five times.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.840
Now, everyone in the city knows

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.380
[Su Mansion]
that the eldest daughter

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.190
we abandoned in the countryside

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.800
has returned.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.320
I will go outside
and welcome the lady back.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.190
At the same time,

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.920
I will teach her the proper manners.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.280
Is this the former home of Zhijin?

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.230
My Lady, you refused
to get off the carriage,

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.710
making such a big scene.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.590
Are you trying to let the whole city

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.190
laugh at the Su Family?

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:38.760
Who are you?

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.960
I am send

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.840
by the Madam to invite you inside.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.920
You...

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.150
Madam?

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.760
I did not even know

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.920
that my father had remarried
after my mother passed away.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.580
Or did you deliberately
damage the reputation of Su Mansion

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.550
in front of others?

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.670
You...

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.490
You've clearly been living rough
in the countryside.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.110
As the lady of Su Mansion,

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.280
you're behaving so uncouthly.

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.550
If you have the guts, get off.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.360
I'll teach you some proper manners.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.510
Just wait and see.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.550
You're just a servant,
yet you dare defy me?

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.030
You hit me again?

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:26.880
I won't just hit you;

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.550
I'll have to kick you too.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.630
You...

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.550
I represent Concubine Gong.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.110
Stop barking like a dog here.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.150
Bring your master to me at once.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.190
Qingran, no need to be so aggressive.

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.280
You just got back,

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.840
and you've already hurt my servant.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.190
How impressive.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.480
So this is the Concubine Gong
whom Zhijin mentioned.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:05.920
Pay my greetings to you,

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:07.150
Father,

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:08.590
Grandmother.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.060
Why not return to the mansion?

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.580
What are you making a fuss about here?

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.550
Master, you must stand up for me.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.150
I went out to greet the lady.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.670
I never expected to be beaten
like this by her.

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.400
I have served the Su Family

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.400
diligently for decades.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.840
The lady's doing is truly heartbreaking.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.230
Qingran, if you have any grievance
with me, just say it.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.880
Right in front of all these people,

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.710
you humiliated a servant.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.880
This truly brings shame
to the Su Mansion.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:38.760
Your servant,

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.150
at the gate of Su Mansion,

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.220
slandered the legitimate daughter
of the Su Family.

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:43.230
That is not bad enough.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.110
Yet she threw Su Mansion's honor aside

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.510
and spouted nonsense right at the gate.

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.280
As the legitimate daughter, how could I
just stand by and watch?

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.230
That wretched servant just now

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.400
actually dared to call you "Madam".

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.920
Though I grew up in the countryside,

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.070
I still understand this much:

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.630
a wife is a wife,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.250
and a concubine is a concubine.

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:04.840
They can never be the same.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.510
You...

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:09.630
What?

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.510
Concubine Gong,

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.070
did I say something wrong?

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.920
The little brat intimidated me
as soon as she got back.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.510
If it weren't for making you marry
in place of Feiyi,

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:20.940
you would have died in the brothel.

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.800
I will keep today's matter in mind

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.400
and settle this with you another day.

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.030
Madam, Master,

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.920
today's incident is my fault.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.110
I failed to manage my servant properly.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.650
It's all because of this lowly servant
ruining my reputation

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.000
and stirring trouble
between Qingran and me.

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:40.070
Someone!

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.710
Give Wang Cuihua 30 lashes
with the cane.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.130
Then send her to a village
in the countryside.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.150
Concubine Gong, please have mercy!

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.630
For my loyalty over these ten years,

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.400
please spare me this once.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.440
Concubine Gong.

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.440
Concubine Gong.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.280
No, please!

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:59.280
Let me go.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.320
I'll leave on my own.

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:08.400
Qingran,

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.000
now that you've returned.

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.260
Concubine Gong has found a good match
for you.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.480
The marriage alliance
with the Prince Zhenbei's Mansion

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.390
is something
that countless prestigious families

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:17.550
in Yunzhou City dream of.

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.000
Such a perfect match.

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:21.510
Why not give it to my sister?

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:24.550
You are the eldest daughter.

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:26.510
A younger sister can't marry

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.440
before her old sister.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.000
I heard my sister has returned.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.670
Su Feiyi?
She's actually Zhijin's sister?

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:46.440
You...

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:48.320
You're not Su Qingran.

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:49.840
You're that vile woman.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.190
Are you crazy?

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.510
She's crazy.

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.110
As a daughter of a concubine,

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.110
she dares to insult me.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.550
Bad example from the top
leads to ruin below.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.550
Wen Yueqian had her eyes gouged out,

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:05.760
then was thrown off a bottomless cliff.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.000
There's no way she survived.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.030
It's hard to believe

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:12.230
there could be two people so alike
in this world.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.800
Feiyi, who do you think I am?

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.030
You seem quite afraid of my appearance.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.000
Everyone is staring at you.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.960
Let's talk about this back
at the mansion.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:23.550
Don't embarrass yourself here.

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.150
In front of all the city's residents,

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.840
that mother and daughter dare treat me
this way.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.840
If we return to the mansion
and close the doors,

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:32.840
who knows what they might do to me?

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:33.770
What do you all think?

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:34.440
Isn't that right?

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.280
Yes, yes, that's exactly it.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:37.840
Father,

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.840
if outsiders find out,

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.480
they'll say

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.360
you can't tell your wife
from your concubine,

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.110
favoring the concubine over the wife.

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:58.000
Feiyi, apologize to your sister.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.130
Show her some respect first.

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:03.070
After she marries that sickly one
who won't live long,

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.110
she will suffer a lot.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:06.800
So that's how it is.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.230
I was wondering why Su Feiyi didn't
marry Wanyan Qi

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:10.710
and they brought Zhijin back home.

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:11.590
It turns out

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:14.000
that Wanyan Qi's illness has relapsed
and he won't last long.

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:16.030
Qingran,

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:17.350
I was wrong.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:18.880
Please forgive me.

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:21.000
Since you admit your mistake,

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:23.640
I won't hold it against you.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:25.920
From today on,

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:28.520
I am the only legitimate daughter

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.960
of the Su Family,

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:32.430
Su Qingran.

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.320
Good.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.470
This is quite interesting indeed.

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:41.310
My Lord,

00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:44.000
she was the courtesan
in the brothel yesterday,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.110
and she has become
Su Family's daughter today.

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:48.880
She's really extraordinary.

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:51.840
I have returned to the mansion.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.070
Step aside at once.

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:01.800
Master Su, please don't leave.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.250
You still owe us silver coins.

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:04.960
One petal for one coin.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.560
Zhijin, these are your family.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:14.070
In their eyes,
you're only a replacement.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.370
They know the path ahead
is a pit of fire,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.470
but they won't hesitate to push you in.

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:32.150
Stop.

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:36.390
This ends now.

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.270
This is an order from Concubine Gong.

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:42.840
Concubine Gong has really tamed you
to forget your place.

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:44.640
I am the legitimate daughter

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.270
of the Su Family.

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:48.230
Even if Concubine Gong stands here,

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:50.000
I am still the one to be respected.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:52.680
Now leave at once.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.880
It must feel awful
to follow the wrong master.

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:10.960
You gave your all for someone

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:13.310
who then discarded you like an old shoe.

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:15.760
Right now, there's an opportunity.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.760
It's up to you whether to take it.

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:20.150
Work for me.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:24.270
What a spendthrift!

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:27.230
She has cost me dearly.

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:29.070
Father.

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.470
Father,

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.430
she suffered such grave injuries.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:35.920
It's best not to punish her.

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:38.470
Why not let her follow me from now on?

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:41.350
If you like,

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:42.470
she can follow you.

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:44.190
Father.

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:46.190
What is it now?

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.150
I still don't know

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:50.230
where I will stay.

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:53.440
Stay at Qinyuan Garden for now.

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:01.390
Oh no, I've never been here before.

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:03.350
Where exactly is Qinyuan Garden?

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.660
Get up quickly and go back
to Qinyuan Garden with me.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:06.720
Hmph.

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:17.000
Get up quickly.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.170
Qinyuan Garden is this way.

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:25.100
I'll go back with you.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.030
My Lady,

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:46.270
this is some fresh cherries
I just picked.

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:47.800
Try some while they're fresh.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.150
If you need anything else,
just let me know.

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:52.760
Thank you for your kindness, Cuihua.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.070
I don't like eating cherries.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.030
My Lady,

00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:00.110
I remember you love cherries the most.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:05.270
Eating cherries will make me
break out in red rashes

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:06.390
and not catch my breath.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.780
I didn't expect Zhijin to like cherries
so much.

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.680
Looks like I have to be more careful
in the future,

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.390
to avoid raising any suspicions.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:15.960
Maybe it's because

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.920
I ate too many wild cherries
in the countryside.

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:21.230
Once, my tooth got sensitive
from the sourness.

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:22.110
After that,

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:23.390
I rarely ate them.

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:24.230
Put it here for now.

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:25.640
I'll eat it later.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:28.840
It is my fault for being careless.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.000
These past few days,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.010
thanks for your hard work.

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:33.000
Go and rest first.

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.270
I'm more than happy

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:36.430
to serve you.

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:37.520
I'm not tired at all.

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:39.390
Oh, right, My Lady,

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.350
in a few days will be Lady Feiyi's
birthday.

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:42.310
Master and

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.520
Concubine Gong

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.800
will host a birthday celebration
for Lady Feiyi.

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:46.960
I've also prepared

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.110
several new outfits for you.

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:49.800
How about

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.510
I bring them over
and have you try them on?

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:52.760
Go ahead.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.410
Bring them over so you can try them.

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:02.000
Bring them over so you can try them.

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:11.960
My Lady, please rest assured.

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.540
If Lady Feiyi and Concubine Gong dare
to bully you,

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:15.820
I'll be the first to oppose them.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:16.600
I,

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:17.640
Wang Cuihua,

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.270
swear to protect you to the death.

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:21.230
Go now.

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:22.030
Alright.

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:28.800
Birth

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:29.640
day

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:31.190
celebration.
