00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.720
The things you gave me…

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.480
I’m returning them.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.080
Ice.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.960
Ice.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.480
Actually,

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.800
my dad forced us to be in a fake relationship.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.200
There’s someone else I like.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.400
I never wanted to kiss Warm.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.280
Because the only person I want to kiss

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.680
is you.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.000
Let go of me.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.040
It's not my fault.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.120
I never thought

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.680
Warm would do something like that to me.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.640
I’m sorry

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.560
for letting you go through something dangerous again.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.000
If you had known beforehand,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.920
would you have let me be in danger like that?

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.720
Thank you so much.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.280
Right now Warm is no longer a student.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.320
With all the charges he got,

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.520
he’ll probably be in jail for a long time.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.720
His future is really over this time.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.200
Saint.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.680
Take care of Ice for now, okay?

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.160
At least until the filming day.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I’ll probably be busy with pre-production.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.000
It’s fine.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.640
I’m getting discharged this evening anyway.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.520
Let someone else help for once.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.720
Just take it as me asking.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.720
Ahem.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.160
The next group of visitors is coming now.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.600
So the previous group,

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.039
please step out.

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.920
See you later.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.120
Take care of Ice for me, okay? Yeah.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.720
Bye.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Bye-bye. Bye bye.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.960
See you. See you.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.400
Stay strong, man.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.280
Let’s go.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.800
Ice. Hi.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.880
How are you feeling?

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.280
Are you okay now?

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.920
I’m okay.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.520
If you’re okay,

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.479
when you leave the hospital,

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.800
I want you to stop by to see my dad.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.039
My dad is a music therapist.

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:00.640
I think he might be able to help you.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.680
Thank you.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.680
But I feel bad.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.680
I’m okay, really.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.600
Uh…

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.800
fine, I’ll go.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.200
Maybe meeting your dad

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:18.079
would be good.

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:18.720
Great.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.600
Okay.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.280
Mm…

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.280
But there’s one thing I really don’t understand.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.280
How did you end up dating Warm?

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.400
Anyway,

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.560
I hope from now on you meet good people.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.280
Like someone like Phas, for example.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.440
He’s still single too.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.160
You asshole. Sorry.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.640
Oh, one more thing.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.760
Maybe this isn’t the right time,

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.000
but I want to ask

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.560
if you still want to submit your song to the contest.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.680
Of course I’m interested.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.800
But when’s the deadline?

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.920
Yeah, the deadline is actually today.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.360
Before tonight.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.400
How much have you finished?

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.800
I only finished the hook.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.760
Only the hook?

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.080
Since all of us are here anyway,

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.720
why don’t we write it together?

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.600
Yeah.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.160
Right?

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.000
You’re not busy, right?

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.560
Shall we start?

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.040
Yeah, so we can finish it today. Ah.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.840
Really?

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.800
Come on, sit down.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.240
I’ll send you the track then.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.320
Okay.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.320
What you wrote is something like

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.960
I’ll repay you with all the love in my heart.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.240
What’s wrong?

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.159
Just tired.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.960
I already told you that

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.560
you don’t have to take care of me.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.120
I can take care of myself.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.760
Maybe go rest first.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.440
That's even more tiring.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.960
What’s wrong?

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.400
Tell me, don’t be ridiculous.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.480
If I say it straight,

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.640
I’ll look ridiculous.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.040
Try saying it first.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.640
Hurry.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.320
Well….

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.560
I saw you working on the song with Phas nonstop.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.120
I have to submit the song tonight.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.120
I haven’t finished writing it.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.040
Then….

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.320
Go finish writing with him.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.760
You’ll get to meet his dad too.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.880
See?

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.800
It’s so ridiculous.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.040
Phas?

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.280
He just gives suggestions.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.320
But I never like his ideas.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.280
When I’m with other people,

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.720
I can’t write songs.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.720
So I waited to come back and write with you.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:16.560
Hmm?

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:19.720
So….

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.440
You haven’t written anything new since then?

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.640
I couldn’t find inspiration I liked.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.680
Have you found it yet?

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.320
Hmm.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.960
If you like someone close to you,

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.840
what would you do?

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.040
I'm going to write a song.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.320
So let me do some research.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.560
How close?

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.600
If...

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.840
it’s a very close friend.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.000
I’d probably see first

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.400
whether they like me.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.080
If they don’t show any sign of liking me,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.240
I wouldn’t tell them.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.040
But if they seem like they like me….

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.080
I’d probably show them that I like them.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.320
And what would you do?

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.200
I like giving flowers.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.520
If there was a flower

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.040
that represented my relationship with them.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.560
I’d keep it just between the two of us.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.960
The rest would just be like everyone else.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.680
Being by their side.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.520
Taking care of them.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.200
Helping them with what they need.

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.560
And...

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.840
not letting them feel lonely.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.760
Then why don’t you just tell them directly.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.120
That you like them.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.520
I think...

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.400
actions matter more than words.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.280
Then...

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.880
how would they be sure.

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:37.400
I don’t want to assume things.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:38.760
Ah..

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.280
I mean….

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:42.320
If it were me.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.120
And someone liked me

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.200
but didn’t tell me directly.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.280
I would never assume it.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.160
And if it were you,

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.240
liking someone close.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.400
Would you tell them?

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:00.960
That you like them?

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:07.240
Yeah.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.760
If I’m not sure they feel the same.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.040
I wouldn’t dare say it either.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.000
Hey

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.720
the sun’s setting.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.000
Help me write this.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:34.720
Or I won’t make it.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.320
Do you remember the red sunflower?

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:43.880
Yeah.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.160
Of course.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.880
Your dad hated it.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.720
I think it’s interesting.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.360
Out of the ordinary.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.120
Different.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:14.760
But stands out.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.560
And nothing can replace it.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.520
Sunflowers always face the sun.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.480
And every day when the sun sets,

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.680
they wither.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.800
Then turn back toward where the sun rises again.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.280
But some nights are insanely long.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.920
Long enough that the flower wilts.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:53.840
Hey.

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.640
That’s too dramatic,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:58.960
no.

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.240
But you do know

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.280
that the sun never goes anywhere.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.000
The sun is the sun.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.640
Even if sometimes it’s hidden

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.080
it never stops giving warmth to the world.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.000
Isn’t the sun carrying too much.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.880
Doesn’t seem like the sunflower

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.480
does anything for the sun.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.840
For the sun to see the sunflower bloom every morning.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.000
That’s enough.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.440
Thank you.

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:26.440
We’ve all been through things that hurt….

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.360
From more than 100 teams

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.840
across more than 8 universities.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:44.240
Today we’ve selected only 10 teams.

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:47.320
Who will present the songs they wrote.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.920
In front of our judges.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.680
With the theme, secret love.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:55.720
Also, the first runner-up and second runner-up

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.800
will receive funding to produce their own song.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:03.240
A huge step into the entertainment industry.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:08.880
Woo!

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.000
(Ice: Where are you?)

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.040
(Ice: Aren't you coming to help?)

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.840
(Saint: I'll be there,)

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.800
(the pipes are broken and I'm fixing it. )

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.600
(Ice: But you'll make it in time to watch me perform?)

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.040
(Right?)

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:31.000
(Ice: Will you make it?)

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.760
(Saint: Are you the last performance?)

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.200
(Saint: That's another hour,)

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.360
(I'll be there on time.)

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.520
Let’s introduce the judges.

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.440
Lots of surprises for sure.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.440
Our first judge, artist and singer,

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.160
Jymes Alan.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:51.880
A round of applause please! Woo!

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:52.720
Hmm?

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.320
Our second judge.

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:58.280
Chanya Arpaphisut, CEO of TQB.

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:00.240
The number-one

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:01.800
entertainment production company of 2024.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.000
Also known as Mother Jan, my mom!

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:07.960
Woo!

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.840
Everyone, I need advice.

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:13.640
So….

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.120
the deputy club president.

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.560
He suddenly got food poisoning.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.560
And the team can’t run the event alone.

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:21.680
We might have to go up as the first performers.

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.680
Then go help them after.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:25.920
Anyone has an issue with that?

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:31.640
And our final surprise judge.

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:35.600
Accepted our invitation at the very last second.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:40.000
Nikom Saengarunwong, our university president!

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.520
Woo!

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.600
The judges are all here.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.880
If we’re going to cut in line,

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:52.200
it has to be now.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:00.640
Okay.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.120
I’m fine with it.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:02.840
Yeah.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.160
Everyone okay?

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:05.720
We can do this.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.320
Everyone must be really excited.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.240
Are you ready?

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.160
Another round of cheers!

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:17.760
Woo!

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.000
Okay,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
and to not waste time.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.080
Let’s listen to the first song.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.800
Titled 'Red Sunflower Lamp'.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:28.360
By Karun Thongdee,

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.440
or Ice Rising Star.

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:32.360
Our campus's newest star.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.680
A round of applause for Ice!

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:39.880
Woo!

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.960
(I once went through pain.)

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:17.240
(But then you came and gathered my broken heart.)

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:21.280
(You healed the wounds that never faded.)

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:24.720
(The feeling I have when I’m with you.)

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:28.240
(It changed the sky that was once dark)

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:34.080
(into a light that made my heart beat strongly again.)

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:38.000
(And nobody can ever take your place)

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.520
(because love has tied our hearts together.)

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:47.120
(I promise that every second, there is only you.)

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.520
(Thank you for coming into my life)

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:50.960
(as a ray of sunshine,)

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:55.560
(that gives meaning to a sunflower like me)

00:16:55.560 --> 00:17:00.280
(from once withered to bloom again.)

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:04.280
(Thank you for making everyday)

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:07.200
(no longer lonely as it once was.)

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:11.040
(I'll give back with all the love in my heart.)

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:16.680
(Always Red Sunflower of yours.)

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:22.119
Woo!

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.760
That was my song.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:38.000
And…

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:41.600
This is the inspiration that made me write it.

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:43.600
I admit

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:46.520
the melody is beautiful.

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.160
But the lyrics

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.720
focus too much on something personal.

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.120
Or on one specific person.

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:57.680
It probably won’t make others feel anything.

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:03.080
If a secret crush isn’t specific.

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.640
Does that mean I like many people?

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:10.320
As for…

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:13.080
Who feels what…

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.600
I think that depends on each person.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.640
Who likes my song?

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:18.520
Make some noise!

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:24.640
Woo! Woo!

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.000
And why assume

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.200
a secret crush song is a love song?

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:34.840
I think it’s more like…

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.000
A heartbreak song.

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:39.120
Because from what I’ve seen,

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:40.280
people who secretly love someone

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.480
never get what they want.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.040
I’ve said everything I wanted to say.

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.600
Through the lyrics already.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.760
But if you listen to my song

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:57.480
with an open enough heart

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.240
you should understand

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.480
what I was trying to say.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.280
Thank you.

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.240
Ice.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.720
I fixed the pipe already.

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.480
But I’m soaking wet.

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.280
Can I still make it in time?

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.240
Shit..

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.040
Uh...

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:02.600
And...

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.640
that is the inspiration behind my song.

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:06.720
Hoo! What is going on?

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.600
Hey, no.

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:10.520
I didn’t mean that…

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:12.840
this person is the inspiration for my song.

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:13.360
I..

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:17.040
I meant the story between me and…

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:23.840
Someone… made me able to write this song.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:26.880
Thank you.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.000
Woo! Woo!

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.440
Omg,

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.560
those two definitely have something going on.

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:35.080
Right?

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:37.040
They live together?

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.680
Are they roommates?

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.560
Where are you staying now?

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:50.960
With Book.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.240
Then why were you fixing the water pipe in Ice’s room?

00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:01.880
Ice accidentally took my script instead of his.

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.480
And I already finished my homework.

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.360
So I went to get the script back.

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:11.040
And the bathroom pipe in his room was broken.

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:13.040
So I just fixed it.

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:16.720
If you and that pornstar keep secretly talking again.

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.440
I’ll send you to study abroad.

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.160
Saint.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.040
Saint.

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.920
Do you know what you did today?

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:54.760
Saint.

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:02.840
Saint.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:06.640
Saint.

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:34.360
Where the hell did he go?

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:42.720
Easy man.

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:43.960
Easy, my hand’s stiff.

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.040
Stand straight.

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.400
Hey…

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:54.120
Mud, you asshole.

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:56.800
Why are you spacing out, it hurts.

00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.280
To make them even.

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:00.760
Really? Will they be even? Yeah.

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.200
They’re separated, this one is the weakest.

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:03.200
Really?

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:10.240
These two fingers are the hardest.

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.000
Ice.

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:15.000
Thank you.

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:24.680
What are you guys doing?

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.400
Ow, that hurts.

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.840
It hurts? Yeah.

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:32.720
You need help with anything.

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.080
You’re being loud, I’m embarrassed.

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:35.600
It hurts.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000
It’s probably broken. Uh…

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:42.960
Who’s this?

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.160
Oh.

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:44.760
Benz,

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:45.280
Oh.

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:47.120
why are you here?

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:48.520
Uh, well…

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.120
Everyone…

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:52.640
This is Benz,

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.600
he’s here to film behind-the-scenes for our shoot.

00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:58.520
Sea,

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.360
the person you asked me to find.

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:01.400
I found him.

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:04.560
You’re coming on set with us right?

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:05.400
Yes.

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:06.360
Please take care of him.

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:07.320
Of course.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:10.640
Benz.

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:11.120
Hmm.

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.240
This is Ice, our other lead actor.

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:14.840
Oh.

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.080
Nice to meet you.

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:21.280
Today is our last workshop.

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:22.880
Before going to set.

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:25.440
The things I want all actors to bring.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.720
Are only three things.

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.080
One,

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:29.800
be your character one hundred percent.

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.280
Two,

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:33.480
do what your character wants to do.

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.080
And three,

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:37.760
be the most honest with your own feelings.

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:42.320
Everyone close your eyes.

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:49.040
Go back to 1997 when the financial crisis hit.

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:53.560
Think about how you lived then.

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:55.320
And how the situation

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:58.520
affected you.

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:01.120
Your financial status, personality,

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:03.080
dreams.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:08.440
If you’re ready you can open your eyes and walk.

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:13.920
Try it.

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:15.720
See what you say,

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.240
what you do, and with whom.

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:18.920
And you must know.

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:22.080
What the goal of what you say is.

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.040
And what you want in return.

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.320
You can speak now.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.560
Last night you slept with Saint.

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:30.560
What did you do with Saint?

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:32.360
I don’t know Saint,

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:34.360
get out, asshole.

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:39.480
Don’t forget to be the character.

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:52.000
I’m sorry for being disgusting.

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:55.200
Don’t come near me,

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:56.840
you futureless gay.

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:33.760
Hey.

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:40.640
When Saint moved back to his condo,

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.200
Book kicked me out like a dog.

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.800
And told me to find my own place to sleep.

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:48.240
Mud.

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:51.400
If you’re staying in my room for a day or two

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.480
I don’t mind.

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:54.720
But I have a sofa.

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.760
Why are you sleeping right next to me.

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:57.760
I couldn’t sleep.

00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:00.200
I have to hug Book every night to fall asleep.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:00.720
Hey.

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:03.040
If you hug me, you’re dead.

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:05.480
Hug your bag instead.

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:08.360
Go.

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:10.480
I’m going to bed.

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:15.360
Do you think Saint is going to sleep hugging Book?

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:17.360
Huh?

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:24.880
Book isn’t talking to me at all these days.

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:26.400
It’s so suffocating.

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.400
What did you do to get him mad?

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:45.400
Has Saint been acting weird lately?

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:48.400
Just today,

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:50.600
he didn’t talk to me.

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:52.440
And he didn’t come back to our room.

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:54.440
See?

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:57.720
Do you think Saint and Book,

00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:58.920
like each other?

00:27:58.920 --> 00:27:59.920
Nonsense!

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:05.840
Do you know?

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:09.360
Last year Saint and Book were roommates.

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:11.560
Actually they’ve been roommates

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:13.080
since their exchange program abroad.

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:16.280
But the weird part is this..

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:18.600
Those two are filthy rich.

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.040
Why did they buy a one-bedroom condo?

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:22.240
With one bed?

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.080
And they even sleep next to each other!

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:25.840
So weird.

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.200
And their bedroom

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:30.280
even has Saint’s flower photo hanging at the foot of the bed.

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.440
Book refuses to take it down.

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:38.800
What flower is it?

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.920
A red sunflower.

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:47.320
Book once wrote a magazine column.

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:49.000
About that flower of Saint’s.

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.040
He was so into it.

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:54.840
I think Saint used that flower to flirt with Book.

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:58.080
If there were a flower

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:00.280
to symbolize my relationship with him.

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:02.600
I’d keep it

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.840
just for the two of us.

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:10.000
The rest would be like everyone else.

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:12.720
Standing by him.

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.880
Taking care of him.

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.760
Helping him with whatever he needs.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:20.880
And

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:23.400
never letting him feel lonely.

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:26.400
Book?

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:29.520
No way.

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:35.440
And the peak

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.520
was at the start of the semester.

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:40.200
It looked like Book was talking to someone.

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:42.400
And suddenly Saint moved out immediately.

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:44.680
I think he was heartbroken.

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:47.120
But now,

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.200
Book doesn’t have anyone.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.560
Saint rushed back right away!

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:54.440
God damn it!

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:55.840
I don’t want them to date!

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:57.560
Shit.

00:29:58.280 --> 00:29:59.400
Ow, Mud!

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:02.480
What’s wrong with you?

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:04.680
Do you like Book or what?

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:10.800
Go to sleep, you need to wake up early tomorrow.

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:13.240
And if those two like each other.

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:15.800
What right do we have to stop them?

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:19.040
Go to sleep!

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:22.960
What’s with you?

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:27.280
And why are you angry?

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.080
Why am I irritated?

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:39.000
What’s wrong with me?

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.280
Sure. You dressed so pretty today.

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:58.280
I can't? The fit is too fire.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:00.000
Remember your pair? Let’s go.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.080
I remember. Okay.

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:01.960
Get in the car.

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:03.840
In the back, in the back.

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:04.880
Okay.

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.160
The team is complete.

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:07.880
Chun and Narong is waiting at the set.

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:11.240
Sea, Cookie and Katy are all here.

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:14.280
Only the main group left and…

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:16.920
Lanee, who is the client,

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:20.800
acting coach and director’s emotional support.

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:21.920
Still not here.

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:24.360
Should I give you a knob on the head?

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:25.400
I'm here.

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:26.560
Ooh.

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:27.840
Here are the snacks.

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:29.640
You look beautiful today.

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:32.520
Thank you, gorgeous investor.

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:34.520
My sweetheart.

00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:35.320
Ooh.

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.000
This is the investor, behave.

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.280
Ms. Lanee.

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:40.120
Go go, get in the car.

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:41.880
Give me your bag, I’ll carry it.

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:44.080
Ooh, one waist grab already.

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:46.600
Katy, do you want me to throw hands?

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:47.320
Check the attendance.

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:48.760
Yes.

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:50.120
So you can stop talking.

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:52.960
Help me first.

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:53.880
No.

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:55.080
It’s so hot.

00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:58.160
It’s really hot today.

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:07.040
Mud, wake up.

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:08.080
Who is that?

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:08.920
We’re here.

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:17.160
Okay.

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:19.800
Our main lead and main villain are here.

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:21.560
Hurry.

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:23.600
Hi Cookie.

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:24.480
Hi Katy.

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:25.000
Hello.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.520
Is the male lead not coming with the main lead?

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:30.360
Yeah.

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:39.480
Fancy.

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:45.520
Handsome too.

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:47.720
Look, they’re even wearing matching shirts.

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:53.480
Hello.

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:55.880
Sorry we’re late.

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:57.480
It’s fine.

00:32:58.400 --> 00:32:59.240
Alright.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.520
Get on. Get on.

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.560
You brought so much stuff.

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:08.160
Yes.

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:09.640
Wow, what is this?

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:10.400
It’s their stuff.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:11.560
Oh.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.400
Sea, where are we filming?

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:21.880
Chanthaburi first and then Cha-am.

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:23.040
Hmm.

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:25.240
Two places. Yes.

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:29.360
This is Saint's spot.

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:32.960
Huh?

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:34.960
What about mine?

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:46.360
Damn.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.560
They’re reserving spots?

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:51.200
Feels like a kindergarten field trip.

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:54.480
You.

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:56.440
Sit here.

00:33:58.840 --> 00:33:59.560
Huh?

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:02.160
What?

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:29.280
It’s hot.

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:31.000
Everyone is here?

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.639
Yeah.

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:35.440
My face is melting already.

00:34:38.639 --> 00:34:40.440
I'm here! Ten is here!

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:42.639
Ten is here!

00:34:42.639 --> 00:34:44.199
Oh my gosh.

00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:46.280
Why so late?

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:47.199
Almost forgot you.

00:34:47.199 --> 00:34:48.639
We were about to leave.

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:51.199
You could’ve just gone without me.

00:34:51.199 --> 00:34:52.880
I’m so sleepy.

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:54.320
No.

00:34:55.679 --> 00:34:57.200
Everyone’s here now.

00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:00.400
Okay, let's get going.

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:02.400
Let’s go!

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:06.320
Okay everyone, come get your key cards.

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:10.000
Katy already assigned the room pairs.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000
It matches the bus seating chart.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.680
Oh, but for Ice

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:15.680
I put you with Saint.

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:19.320
But Saint sat next to Book?

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:26.640
Normally the main couple must sleep together.

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:29.120
It helps the workflow.

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:32.240
Nat, Jay, Dej should be together.

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:33.440
Sure.

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:36.440
Unless you three have issues and can’t share a room.

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:38.760
I’m fine.

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:42.000
Can I request a separate room?

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:44.760
I don’t want to share the room with two other people.

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:46.960
All rooms are full.

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:49.000
Your room is fine though.

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:51.520
Yes, I booked it myself.

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:53.400
You’ll feel safe and comfy.

00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:57.400
That’s not what I’m worried about.

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:05.840
Then sleep with Saint.

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:09.440
I’ll go sleep with Mud and Ten.

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:12.160
But I want to sleep with you more.

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:19.200
Because when we’re free we can practice lines.

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:25.320
Alright alright, come get the key cards.

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:26.680
Ice and Saint, who’s taking it?.

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:27.840
Me.

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.720
Book, Mud, Ten.

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:32.360
Okay.

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:35.040
Cookie, Katy.

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:37.440
This is ours.

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:48.240
Will Ice and Saint even be able to act tomorrow?.

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:51.520
I’m worried.

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:55.840
Trust them.

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:58.480
And if anything happens tomorrow.

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:01.040
I will step in and coach them.

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:05.240
Tonight you should get lots of rest.

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:06.720
Don't overthink it.

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.440
So you'll have the strength to work tomorrow.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.200
Ok?

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:14.200
Sure.

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:16.680
Thank you.

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:21.600
Let's go.

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:23.800
I don't want to be a third wheel around here. Sure.

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:46.440
Why do you want to sleep in Saint’s room?

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:50.240
They’re here to work and practice their scenes.

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:53.680
Why would you sit there and distract everyone?

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:55.880
What the hell are you talking about?

00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:58.800
Fine.

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:01.280
I’m sorry then.

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:04.440
I’m sorry I’m not handsome, clean,

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:06.720
and perfect like your Prince Saint.

00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:09.360
What does Saint have to do with this.

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:11.920
How would it not be related.

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:13.080
You’re with him all the time.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.840
Saint is my friend.

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:19.760
If I feel comfortable around any friend.

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:20.600
I stay with them.

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:23.640
Why would I stay with someone who talks like shit.

00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:25.880
Irritates me and lashes out at me all day?

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:28.760
I’m not staying with someone that toxic.

00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:32.640
Are you talking about me?

00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:36.560
Use your brain, asshole.

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:46.160
And if you don’t stop talking nonsense.

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:48.000
About me and Saint again,

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:50.600
I’m going to curse you out for real.

00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:57.240
Holy shit almost didn’t make it.

00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:59.560
I’d been holding that in since the bus.

00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:00.920
But hey the bathroom’s nice.

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:04.320
Huh?

00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:07.400
Hey, hey.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.520
It stinks.

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:12.640
I can stay there.

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:13.760
Still better than out there.

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:20.440
What the hell is wrong?

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:24.120
Huh?

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:26.120
What did I even do wrong?

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:33.280
Is it good?

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:36.320
Katy.

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:37.600
I’ll get you some pork.

00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:38.600
Yes please.

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:40.760
A big chunky piece. Sure.

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:44.080
Benz, I want this piece.

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:45.000
Sure.

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:47.440
Ice, do you want some pork?

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:49.240
Here, a big piece.

00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:50.800
Thank you.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.400
Eat.

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:02.640
Eat a lot.

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:13.640
Come on, friendship hotpot.

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:17.120
Cheers!

00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:18.160
I can’t reach.

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:20.560
Cheers!

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:22.560
Cheers! Bottoms up!

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:25.440
Refreshing right?

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:26.160
Yeah.

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:43.840
Okay, everyone for fun.

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:46.800
Let’s play a game.

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:48.800
First, deal the cards.

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:49.560
Ah.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000
Pass them around.

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:54.440
Are we missing one?

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:56.560
The rules are.

00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:58.040
The host spins the wheel

00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:02.560
and picks two numbers.

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:05.920
Whoever has those numbers must follow the command.

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:09.560
If you don’t do it.

00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:11.160
You drink!

00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:15.120
Cheers!

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:16.680
Interesting.

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:18.160
Right?

00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:21.840
Sea. Hm?

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:22.840
You go first.

00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:24.840
Put it on the table.

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:27.000
I’ll command first.

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:28.880
Um...

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:33.520
I command

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:36.520
the two numbers.

00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:38.240
To hug each other.

00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:39.280
Ooh!

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.000
Love that!

00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:42.720
Which numbers will it be?

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:51.800
Whoever has three and six.

00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:54.760
Oh.

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:01.480
I got six.

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:05.920
I got three.

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:08.040
Oh. Wow.

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:11.320
Book is three, Mud is six. Hug now.

00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:13.800
What a coincidence.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.440
Perfect pair. I’ll drink instead.

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:29.160
What, just a hug?

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:30.680
I’m sick of his face.

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:32.640
I'm also sick of your face.

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:38.880
Ah.

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:39.760
My turn.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:40.920
Come on.

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:45.520
Whoever gets the numbers I pick.

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:49.120
Must kiss each other on the cheek!

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:51.520
I'm going to start now.

00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:59.080
The numbers are...

00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:00.000
What is it?

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.640
One and four.

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:06.720
Who is it? That side?

00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:07.840
No? Not me.

00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:09.120
I’m one.

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:12.200
Oh.

00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:13.840
And who’s four.

00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:15.160
Saint is one.

00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:16.360
So…

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:17.680
I’m four.

00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:21.240
Oh my god.

00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:22.480
Oh my!!

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:24.960
Ahhh!!

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:27.000
Alright.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.640
Go on.

00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:35.720
Kiss.

00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:36.760
Shh. Kiss.

00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:39.000
Calm down girls.

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:44.400
Kiss!

00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:56.600
I’ll drink instead.

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:00.520
Huh?

00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:01.240
Again?

00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:11.800
No more drinking.

00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:13.480
My turn.

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:17.120
Whoever gets these numbers must kiss on the cheek.

00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:23.440
One and three.

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:25.440
Who could it be?

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:27.000
Oh?

00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:29.120
A new ship.

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:31.280
No drinking.

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:35.320
Just kiss, why are you shy?

00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:40.240
I’m not shy.

00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:42.280
If you're not shy then kiss.

00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:46.840
Kiss!

00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:47.720
Hey!

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.040
I need to shit.

00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:53.040
I’m going.

00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:55.160
I’ll go too.

00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:57.360
Huh?

00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:58.440
Bathroom buddies.

00:44:58.440 --> 00:44:59.440
They are both pooping.

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:03.920
Their organs must be so short.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:30.960
What's wrong?

00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:33.560
Nothing.

00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:37.120
I’m going to smoke, shower, and sleep.

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:41.200
You’re mad at me right?

00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:43.040
Yeah, I'm mad.

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:44.280
Are you satisfied now?

00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:47.920
Hey listen to me.

00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:53.560
Take it.

00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:54.320
I don’t want it.

00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:12.920
I didn’t want you to be angry.

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:19.640
But I had to distance myself because…

00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:23.040
My dad told Benz to keep an eye on me.

00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:28.640
Where are you staying now.

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:31.080
With Book.

00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:35.360
Is that true?

00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:38.640
I checked.

00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:40.640
Book’s room

00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:43.080
still has Saint’s clothes and stuff.

00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:45.920
Not a lot though.

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:50.920
My clothes are being washed.

00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:52.400
The rest...

00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:56.400
I packed in my suitcase.

00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:58.400
For the out-of-town shoot.

00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:01.560
Then why were you fixing Ice’s bathroom pipe?

00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:08.560
Ice accidentally swapped scripts with me.

00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:11.960
And I already did my homework.

00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:14.320
I needed to take my script back to practice.

00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:17.560
And the bathroom pipe was broken.

00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:19.560
So I just fixed it.

00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:24.320
From now on don’t go near that kid again.

00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:25.800
Except for filming.

00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:29.480
Whatever happens to him is none of your concern!

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000
Do you understand?

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:33.320
Bua.

00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:37.960
if he doesn’t go home check his GPS.

00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:40.400
See if he’s with Book.

00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:43.920
His LINE is still synced right?

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:48.240
Watch if they contact each other outside of work.

00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:50.000
Yes sir.

00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:52.120
Benz.

00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:55.440
From today on you pick Saint up

00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:56.760
and drop him off every day.

00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:59.280
Follow him to the out-of-town shoot.

00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:03.720
Report every detail of their behavior to me.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:04.760
Yes sir.

00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:09.120
And if you keep contacting that pornstar,

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:11.440
I’ll send you to study overseas.

00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:36.320
Then why didn’t you tell me sooner.

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:39.760
I was waiting for the right moment.

00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:42.720
No one knows except Book.

00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:46.760
I was going to tell Lanee and Sea today.

00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:50.520
And you…

00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:53.040
I wanted to tell you in private.

00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:54.640
So I could clear everything up.

00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:02.520
There’s nothing to clear up.

00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:08.160
I gave you to keep, I’m not taking it back.

00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:23.800
Here.

00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:27.160
Open your mouth.

00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:37.840
Please.

00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:40.200
Just a little.

00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:58.000
Then why were you flirting with Book?

00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:02.600
Your dad only told you to stay away from me.

00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:05.360
I wasn’t flirting.

00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:07.280
You were.

00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:08.720
I wasn’t.

00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:15.560
Are you jealous?

00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:18.760
No.

00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:21.480
I just don’t want to be in anyone’s way.

00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:24.400
If you like someone, go to them.

00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:38.280
I think…

00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:40.840
I’ve always been clear.

00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:45.920
About who I want to be with.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.160
1997 was the year I hated the most.

00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:34.840
Everywhere reported the economic crisis.

00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:37.800
Some said the world was ending.

00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:39.800
Mom, I'm here.

00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:57.560
So much laundry.

00:52:57.560 --> 00:52:58.960
Put it in the basket.

00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:36.680
What are you doing?

00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:42.200
Can I have this sunflower?

00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:51.400
Stop stalling.

00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:53.440
Go carry your stuff.

00:53:58.200 --> 00:53:59.640
Narong is here.

00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:03.760
This is Narong.

00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:05.920
He will be your new father.

00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:08.240
And this is Seen,

00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:10.000
he will be your older brother.

00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:18.240
I didn’t understand,

00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:20.320
even though we were struggling.

00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:22.240
Mom still brought them here.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.000
Seen arrived with disaster.

00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:32.200
Factories closed, people lost jobs.

00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:34.760
Some families committed suicide.

00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:38.240
Narong, Seen’s father, was disabled

00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:39.800
during a protest for compensations.

00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:41.960
But he was badly beaten.

00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:46.360
Take your bag upstairs.

00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:03.440
Mom said

00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:05.320
Seen was sexually deviant.

00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:07.840
So they sent him to a mental hospital.

00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:10.800
But when he came back, he was even stranger.

00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:36.720
Don’t hang that in my closet.

00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:37.400
It smells.

00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:53.360
Sometimes I thought if I threw that box away.

00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:54.880
Seen would go mad and leave on his own.

00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:17.680
Kit.

00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:18.800
Kit.

00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:20.840
Where’s my box?

00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:21.760
Where’s my box? Hey.

00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:24.200
I threw it away.

00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:26.880
Where?

00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:28.680
By the river.

00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:43.120
Look at him, so late.

00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:47.280
He doesn’t know the time.

00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:49.560
Yeah.

00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:52.040
What can we do?

00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:01.120
You still haven’t stopped

00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:02.720
messing with that damn box?

00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:07.200
I swear in your past life.

00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:08.880
You messed with someone’s wife and kids.

00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:10.520
And now in this life,

00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:11.800
you're paying for your sins

00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:13.440
and we are also burdened by it.

00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:17.200
Dragging us down with you.

00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:19.040
A person like you.

00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:21.040
Alive or dead.

00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:22.920
You’ll burn in hell anyway.

00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:30.680
Dad.

00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:32.640
I’m sorry.

00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:34.680
Go! Oh!

00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:37.120
Don’t touch me, you freak! No, don't!

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:38.440
But I was wrong.

00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:40.000
I couldn’t kick Seen out.

00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:43.400
Maybe I didn’t hate him.

00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:46.560
Maybe he made me nervous.

00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:48.920
And I was scared to accept my feelings.

00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:53.680
One two three, pose.

00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:56.000
Chin, pose. One two three, pose.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.280
You don’t have to stand so close.

00:57:58.280 --> 00:58:00.280
He looks really focused.

00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:02.120
He likes it.

00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:04.840
Move, right hand, under chin. Wow.

00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:07.560
One two three. Hey look.

00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:08.920
Huh?

00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:11.160
Look at who? Look at him.

00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:12.240
Do you get it?

00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:14.640
You did really well today.

00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:15.560
What is he confused about?

00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:16.200
Yeah.

00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:17.680
What’s wrong with him?

00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:20.200
Maybe he wants to be a girl.

00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:21.840
Yeah.

00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:22.880
Why so dramatic.

00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:24.080
Even if I felt that way.

00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:26.640
I didn’t protect Seen.

00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:29.000
I didn’t want people to think

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:29.640
I was weird.

00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:32.400
I didn’t want to be bullied like Seen.

00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:35.920
So I stayed silent.

00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:30.000
Hey! Stop it!

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.560
Hey! Why are you bothering me?

00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:33.720
Let go. Hey!

00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:34.680
You pushed me?

00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:35.480
You pushed me?

00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:37.000
You really want to be a faggot huh?!

00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:41.200
Because you’re a faggot.

00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:42.480
That’s why they bully you.

00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:45.040
If he keeps being weak like this,

00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:46.680
he doesn’t need bullies!

00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:49.280
I’ll beat him myself!

00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:55.120
I was so weak.

00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:59.360
Seen was the strong one

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:03.040
for being himself.

01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:06.280
Even when the whole world cursed him.

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:38.840
What are you doing?

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:47.880
Nothing.

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:49.360
Give me that.

01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:52.200
No.

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:54.000
I didn’t do anything.

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:55.720
Let go.

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:57.240
Let go.

01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:58.040
Kit.

01:00:58.040 --> 01:00:58.880
Let go.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Let go.

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:06.080
Kit.

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:06.800
Let go.

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:10.760
Kit…

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:22.440
I think I heard something.

01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:55.920
You like me right?

01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:02.600
Say it.

01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:54.880
Let go.

01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:57.320
Yes!

01:02:57.320 --> 01:02:58.200
I like men!

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:05.880
Sorry for being disgusting.

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:28.720
I didn’t know my silence

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:30.720
would make Seen so lonely and hopeless

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:36.480
that he chose to end his life.

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:38.120
Hey!

01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:41.480
Don’t!

01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:44.760
Are you crazy? Give it.

01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:46.760
Have you lost your mind Seen? Give it now.

01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:47.840
What about me?

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:02.480
What does that mean?

01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:21.680
Cut!

01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:24.240
Great work everyone.

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:25.040
Great.

01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:27.320
That's it for today.

01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:31.000
Uh.

01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:33.560
How was it?

01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:35.240
It was so good.

01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:36.640
Both of you were so good.

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:40.720
Ok, after this will be the time period where

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:43.200
Kit and Seen will develop their relationship further.

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:47.040
And we will take a one-day break.

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:47.800
So…

01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:50.480
We want both of you

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:52.200
to be a couple for one day.

01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:58.080
It’s a workshop.

01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:00.360
You can’t refuse.

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:02.600
So you can act

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:05.160
more naturally together.

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:08.720
Try doing something you may not like.

01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:11.600
Okay.

01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:14.000
Be my boyfriend for one day?

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:16.760
My bear?

01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:18.360
Okay,

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:20.240
Little Bear.

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:09.120
Wake up.

01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:10.880
Wake up already, it’s late, come on.

01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:12.160
I’m awake.

01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:13.280
I’m awake.

01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:14.880
You’re starting to do more

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:16.160
than what Sea told you to do.

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:18.800
Even if she didn’t tell me…

01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:21.560
I still want to do it.

01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:27.480
Will you be my girlfriend?

01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:28.360
Okay.

01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:30.520
Let go of me!

01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:31.320
Answer me first!

01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:32.320
Why do you want to know?

01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:33.400
Do you like me?

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:33.920
Yeah!

01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:39.920
What are you two doing?

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:45.320
Mom!
