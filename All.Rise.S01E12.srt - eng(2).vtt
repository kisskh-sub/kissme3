Good dog.

00:01:56.681 --> 00:01:58.600
Miss, what's your dog's name?

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.641
(Yong'an Noodle Shop)
We haven't named it yet.

00:02:01.761 --> 00:02:03.201
Why don't you give it a name?

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.681
How about Chen?

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.320
Chen.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.401
So you really don't like eggs at all?

00:02:22.121 --> 00:02:22.856
Want to hug it?

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.081
I don't like dogs.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.440
It doesn't even move. So calm.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.640
It's so sweet.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.521
Let's call it "Sweetie" then.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.281
Sweetie?

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.561
Want to try petting it?

00:03:04.281 --> 00:03:04.961
Sweetie.

00:03:07.681 --> 00:03:08.200
Okay.

00:03:10.401 --> 00:03:11.160
"Sweetie" it is.

No need, it's out of your way.

00:03:41.001 --> 00:03:41.961
The subway station

00:03:41.961 --> 00:03:42.600
is right ahead.

00:03:45.841 --> 00:03:46.480
What's wrong?

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.841
Are you scared of my brother or me?

00:04:07.561 --> 00:04:08.480
Yan Fei, listen.

00:04:09.401 --> 00:04:10.121
I'm not scared of

00:04:10.121 --> 00:04:11.001
either of you.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.920
He didn't pressure me.

00:04:13.241 --> 00:04:14.880
He's not some tycoon in the novel.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.121
He can't tell me what to do.

00:04:16.801 --> 00:04:18.280
He sent someone to me because

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.080
he cared about you.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.048
My girlfri...

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.161
My ex-girlfriend

00:04:25.121 --> 00:04:26.200
caused us

00:04:26.241 --> 00:04:27.440
so much trouble at work.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.241
You think she didn't know

00:04:29.241 --> 00:04:30.520
right from wrong?

00:04:31.001 --> 00:04:33.320
No, she did it because
she's Liang Xiaosong's sister.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.400
She was trying her best to protect

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.001
her brother.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.064
Your brother's the same.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.361
No matter what he does,

00:04:39.121 --> 00:04:40.481
he's trying to protect you.

00:04:42.161 --> 00:04:42.760
I don't know

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:43.960
what your family is like.

00:04:44.241 --> 00:04:46.001
Your brother's only four or five years

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:47.801
older than me,

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.840
and he's carried Xingke alone for years.

00:04:50.481 --> 00:04:51.640
Business isn't easy now.

00:04:51.921 --> 00:04:53.001
You get to

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:54.440
chase your dreams

00:04:54.561 --> 00:04:56.400
without worries at Jun An.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.960
But him?

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.241
He might never even get a choice.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.400
Doesn't he have a dream?

00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:09.080
Most of our generation

00:05:10.161 --> 00:05:11.681
are only children.

00:05:12.001 --> 00:05:13.161
I envy those of you

00:05:13.161 --> 00:05:14.760
with siblings.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.320
After all, I wish someone

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.721
could share my burdens too.

00:05:18.001 --> 00:05:18.536
Right?

00:05:19.001 --> 00:05:20.361
So forget about the ride.

00:05:20.801 --> 00:05:21.640
Go home and talk

00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:22.801
to your brother,

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.944
okay?

00:05:25.608 --> 00:05:26.441
Well.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.681
It's karma for bullying me all the time.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.640
Caught a cold, huh?

00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:56.840
There's a reason for this.

00:05:57.001 --> 00:05:57.921
Reflect on it.

00:05:59.161 --> 00:06:01.241
Ask the housekeeper to cook for you

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.520
if you're hungry.

00:06:03.001 --> 00:06:04.280
I'm too tired to argue.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.280
My head's pounding from meetings.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.681
All you do is work

00:06:10.681 --> 00:06:11.921
and have meetings.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.361
What's the point?

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.241
This is life,

00:06:18.241 --> 00:06:19.241
even if it's pointless.

00:06:21.721 --> 00:06:23.241
Will you attend the meetings for me?

00:06:23.561 --> 00:06:24.121
No way.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:26.888
Yan Da.

00:06:27.921 --> 00:06:30.080
If you hadn't become Xingke's boss,

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.241
what'd you do?

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.200
What are you plotting?

00:06:39.361 --> 00:06:40.400
Just chitchatting.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.001
How old were you when you joined Xingke?

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.161
Twenty-eight.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.481
You were a freshman.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:52.721
I got into

00:06:53.121 --> 00:06:55.121
a sociology PhD program in the UK.

00:06:56.681 --> 00:06:57.960
I meant to go abroad with you,

00:06:58.721 --> 00:06:59.960
but then Dad fell ill,

00:07:01.561 --> 00:07:02.440
so I didn't go.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.041
Doesn't matter.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.241
I wouldn't have become
some great scholar anyway.

00:07:10.921 --> 00:07:11.440
Someone

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.601
in the family
had to shoulder the burdens.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.520
That must have been

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.801
really tough for you.

00:07:22.801 --> 00:07:24.456
I hate it when you interfere in my life.

00:07:24.801 --> 00:07:26.561
But someone said you were protecting me.

00:07:28.161 --> 00:07:29.440
Actually, I know

00:07:29.721 --> 00:07:31.440
you've been making decisions

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.801
for me to protect me.

00:07:35.681 --> 00:07:37.561
I'll forget about what happened today.

00:07:38.241 --> 00:07:38.921
But

00:07:39.361 --> 00:07:40.520
promise me.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.880
Ask me for help if anything happens

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.361
at home

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:45.960
or in our company.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.241
You might look down on law graduates,

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:50.880
but I'm your sister.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:51.640
I'm also a Yan.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:52.561
I'm not useless.

00:07:52.561 --> 00:07:53.481
I'm pretty capable.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:57.400
Fei.

00:07:58.721 --> 00:07:59.440
What happened?

00:08:02.121 --> 00:08:03.400
You don't sound

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:04.880
like yourself.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.561
I'm getting deeply moved.

00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:12.440
Should I burst into tears

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:13.561
right now?

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:17.960
Have you lost it?

00:08:18.361 --> 00:08:20.280
You just can't take sincere words.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.001
Are you hungry?

00:08:27.561 --> 00:08:28.200
No.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.481
"I don't like dogs."

00:08:32.481 --> 00:08:34.280
You almost took Sweetie home.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.280
Actually, I had a dog when I was young.

00:08:41.081 --> 00:08:42.920
But after my parents divorced,

00:08:44.481 --> 00:08:46.321
my dad gave it away.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.241
I remember how heartbroken I was.

00:08:50.241 --> 00:08:51.400
I cried so much.

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.601
I kept begging him,
"Don't send Sweetie away.

00:08:53.601 --> 00:08:54.601
Don't send Sweetie away."

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:55.880
He wouldn't listen.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.001
I don't know where he sent it.

00:08:59.841 --> 00:09:01.321
It was also called Sweetie?

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.760
I named it randomly. What a coincidence.

00:09:08.721 --> 00:09:09.680
After that,

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.001
I've developed

00:09:11.816 --> 00:09:12.400
PTSD

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:13.441
with dogs.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.001
Even at that moment,

00:09:16.601 --> 00:09:17.800
my dad made sure

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:18.721
to lecture me.

00:09:19.241 --> 00:09:21.400
"If you can't take care of someone,

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.040
don't selfishly

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.121
keep them around.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.520
You want to look after Sweetie? Fine.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.001
Gain power first."

00:09:30.241 --> 00:09:30.760
Well said.

00:09:31.721 --> 00:09:33.481
As expected of lawyer Jiang Ruocheng.

00:09:35.361 --> 00:09:36.560
You know how old I was?

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:38.321
How could I gain power?

00:09:41.001 --> 00:09:41.760
A decade later,

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.601
you're rubbing salt in my wounds here.

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.081
I'm sorry.

00:09:47.321 --> 00:09:49.601
You didn't join
your dad's law firm because

00:09:49.601 --> 00:09:51.201
you disagreed with his principles?

00:09:52.721 --> 00:09:53.520
Kind of.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.040
He doesn't

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:58.920
think much of me, saying that

00:09:59.841 --> 00:10:01.280
I'm not cut out to be a lawyer.

00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:02.441
That only makes me

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:03.841
determined to prove

00:10:04.081 --> 00:10:05.361
that I could study,

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:06.721
get into Haryald,

00:10:06.841 --> 00:10:07.841
and stay at Jun An.

00:10:08.241 --> 00:10:09.001
I could even...

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:13.241
What?

00:10:14.201 --> 00:10:14.880
Outdo him?

00:10:16.201 --> 00:10:16.800
Defeat him?

00:10:17.241 --> 00:10:18.520
Fishing for information?

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.400
Why am I the only one talking?

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:21.960
What about you?

00:10:22.841 --> 00:10:23.361
Me?

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:33.721
Are you a child?

00:10:34.241 --> 00:10:35.001
Want to try?

00:10:35.361 --> 00:10:36.008
No.

00:10:36.241 --> 00:10:37.280
It's stress-relieving.

00:10:37.361 --> 00:10:37.920
No.

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:39.080
Seriously.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.560
I said no. I refused.

00:10:44.601 --> 00:10:45.201
Just try it.

(Yan Fei: Thanks for your advice.

He won't interfere anymore?)

Jiatong, you're back?

00:12:24.001 --> 00:12:24.640
Have you eaten?

00:12:25.841 --> 00:12:26.560
Yeah.

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.880
Something amazing happened.

00:12:30.441 --> 00:12:30.961
You know?

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.640
I always thought
I had great people skills.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.920
Being likable is what I've excelled at

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:36.961
for twenty whole years.

00:12:37.481 --> 00:12:38.601
But today I met this lady,

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:40.121
the one Yan Fei pissed off.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.121
The residents' committee staff

00:12:42.481 --> 00:12:44.880
said her husband
got injured during his commute.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.040
I was about to raise funds for her.

00:12:47.721 --> 00:12:48.920
But Mr. Zhou told me

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:50.560
that we must treat

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:51.520
the clients

00:12:51.721 --> 00:12:53.481
who are relatively disadvantaged

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:54.201
with empathy,

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:55.680
but not sympathy.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.241
I shouldn't judge others from

00:12:58.321 --> 00:12:59.520
a privileged standpoint.

00:12:59.721 --> 00:13:00.880
That's disrespectful.

00:13:01.601 --> 00:13:03.280
Guo Xiaoyu, you've really changed.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.081
You used to nag me

00:13:05.081 --> 00:13:06.721
about Zhubao all day.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.201
Now all you talk about is work.

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:09.672
Really?

00:13:22.001 --> 00:13:22.760
Maybe it's because

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:25.441
things are over between us.

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:29.800
Forget it.

00:13:29.841 --> 00:13:31.121
Work keeps me busy.

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:32.560
But at night,

00:13:33.841 --> 00:13:36.280
I feel completely hollowed out inside.

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:38.728
Don't even wanna watch shows.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:44.361
Did he contact you?

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.241
But I think he will.

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:50.800
Our last fight

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.040
lasted even longer than this.

00:13:53.121 --> 00:13:55.001
It's just about who caves in first.

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:56.640
It's a mind game right now.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.280
Whoever surrenders first
will have to submit to the other.

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:00.721
So I can't back down.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:02.760
Impressive, Xiaoyu.

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.520
You've got so many strategies.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:08.232
Jiatong.

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.001
I've never heard you mention any guys

00:14:11.081 --> 00:14:12.121
or ex-boyfriends.

00:14:13.321 --> 00:14:14.680
Stop being so mysterious.

00:14:15.321 --> 00:14:16.441
What's your type?

00:14:17.241 --> 00:14:17.841
Got a photo?

00:14:18.081 --> 00:14:18.680
Show me.

00:14:23.841 --> 00:14:24.361
No.

00:14:26.481 --> 00:14:27.432
I've always been solo.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.481
I'm aiming for asexual reproduction,

00:14:29.481 --> 00:14:30.920
following the paramecium model.

00:14:31.441 --> 00:14:32.280
Knock it off.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:34.632
Be honest.

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.001
Is there anyone

00:14:38.321 --> 00:14:39.640
around us that you're into?

00:14:41.081 --> 00:14:43.121
Wang Lu is thoughtful and careful.

00:14:43.721 --> 00:14:45.441
Li Ke is handsome and good with people.

00:14:46.361 --> 00:14:47.400
Mr. Zhou is responsible.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:48.680
Jiang Chen is...

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:50.481
Arrogant.

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:51.880
Full of himself.

00:14:52.241 --> 00:14:52.961
Self-righteous.

00:14:53.321 --> 00:14:55.241
Not really. I think he's quite handsome.

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.441
He's got something
to back up that ego, okay?

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:01.481
Handsome?

00:15:04.201 --> 00:15:04.880
I don't think so.

00:15:11.321 --> 00:15:11.961
This is fishy.

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:14.280
Really fishy.

00:15:15.481 --> 00:15:16.160
Come clean.

00:15:18.721 --> 00:15:19.601
There's nothing.

00:15:20.241 --> 00:15:21.841
There's nothing between us.

00:15:21.841 --> 00:15:23.121
We're extremely incompatible.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:25.241
To put it in the terms you know,

00:15:25.241 --> 00:15:25.864
it's like

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.160
"different styles,"

00:15:27.321 --> 00:15:28.201
"incompatible

00:15:28.201 --> 00:15:30.001
zodiac signs," and "mismatched views."

00:15:32.321 --> 00:15:33.280
You can't stop talking

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:35.121
when I mention Jiang Chen.

00:15:35.441 --> 00:15:36.601
You think I'll believe you?

00:15:36.841 --> 00:15:37.736
Why are you so nosy?

00:15:37.736 --> 00:15:38.321
Are you

00:15:38.321 --> 00:15:39.081
eating or not?

00:15:39.081 --> 00:15:40.321
Yeah, I'm eating.

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:10.472
Morning, Ms. Tian.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:14.248
I've reviewed the case you and Ms. Bai

00:16:14.536 --> 00:16:16.081
posted in the lawyer pool yesterday.

00:16:16.441 --> 00:16:17.520
Is there any chance...

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:22.560
Just like you,

00:16:23.201 --> 00:16:24.961
they texted Ms. Bai and me.

00:16:25.961 --> 00:16:27.280
I'd wait for you at the office.

00:16:28.241 --> 00:16:30.560
But you camped at the reception
to snatch the case.

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:34.520
You three are seriously competitive.

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:37.201
You're in charge of this case.

00:16:37.201 --> 00:16:38.961
We'll absolutely give it our all.

00:16:39.961 --> 00:16:40.640
You punk.

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:41.920
I like what you said.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:43.400
Ms. Tian.

00:16:43.721 --> 00:16:45.400
Can we compete for this opportunity?

00:16:46.241 --> 00:16:47.680
I understand the enthusiasm.

00:16:48.721 --> 00:16:49.241
Alright.

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:50.160
I'll keep it brief.

00:16:51.361 --> 00:16:52.441
Our client

00:16:52.441 --> 00:16:53.481
filed a lawsuit

00:16:53.481 --> 00:16:55.121
as plaintiff in Beijing

00:16:55.601 --> 00:16:57.160
based on the defendant's

00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:58.841
registered address.

00:16:59.081 --> 00:17:00.160
But the defendant claims

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.560
that their site isn't
within Beijing's jurisdiction.

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:04.800
They merely rented an office there

00:17:04.961 --> 00:17:06.080
with no actual staff.

00:17:06.721 --> 00:17:08.001
Therefore, the defendant

00:17:08.001 --> 00:17:09.360
raised jurisdiction objection.

00:17:09.721 --> 00:17:11.560
Currently, they intend to have this case

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:12.681
transferred to Shenzhen.

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:15.401
We've sent interns to investigate

00:17:15.401 --> 00:17:16.881
their office in Beijing.

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.600
Their statement is accurate.

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.080
Meanwhile, we also asked

00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:23.520
our colleagues in Shenzhen

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:25.800
to check their offices there.

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:28.080
Those were also just a few offices,

00:17:28.641 --> 00:17:30.520
which couldn't be their primary base.

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.320
So now, I need you

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.120
to investigate and verify the details

00:17:35.961 --> 00:17:37.481
on their actual place of business

00:17:37.721 --> 00:17:39.800
to see if we can
find something more solid

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.320
to counter their argument.

00:17:42.921 --> 00:17:44.320
So? Is everything clear?

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:46.360
All clear.

00:17:50.376 --> 00:17:53.384
(Jurisdictional Objection)

00:17:53.384 --> 00:17:57.800
(An objection raised when a party
believes the court lacks jurisdiction.)

00:18:13.768 --> 00:18:14.344
(Zhubao: Sep 5th.
Dinner with colleagues.)

00:18:14.344 --> 00:18:14.952
(Aug 17th. So beautiful.)

00:18:14.952 --> 00:18:15.656
(Jul 9th. Staying up
watching sports together.)

00:18:15.656 --> 00:18:16.488
(Jun 7th)

00:18:16.584 --> 00:18:22.568
(The sunshine that day
was as lovely as you.)

00:18:22.984 --> 00:18:24.840
(Zhubao Loves Xiaoyu)

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:27.464
(Who brings a laptop to dinner?)

00:18:27.464 --> 00:18:29.736
(No overtime today.)

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:36.921

He followed someone else?

00:18:40.008 --> 00:18:40.680
(Quiet Woods)

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:41.288
(Nice weather.)

00:18:41.288 --> 00:18:42.152
(Stunning sunset.)

00:18:52.721 --> 00:18:53.961
You think that Zhu Zhisheng

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:55.760
is cheating?

00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.120
He won't answer calls

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:00.001
or messages.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:01.401
I've DMed him on Weibo,

00:19:01.401 --> 00:19:02.800
Douyin, and RedNote.

00:19:03.401 --> 00:19:04.441
Still no response.

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.001
This was impossible before.

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:08.808
Yeah.

00:19:09.481 --> 00:19:10.840
I must go back to Hangzhou

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:12.881
and get the full story.

00:19:18.961 --> 00:19:20.320
Maybe you should think twice.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.441
I'm just so lost right now.

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:27.961
You're accusing him of cheating based on

00:19:27.961 --> 00:19:29.280
a pair of shoes in a photo.

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.280
That's a severe lack of evidence.

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.360
But in relationships,

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:35.560
a woman's intuition beats evidence

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:36.481
every time.

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.520
We've never gone this long
without talking.

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:43.201
Jiatong.

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.681
Was it a mistake for me

00:19:46.721 --> 00:19:47.800
to come to Beijing

00:19:50.401 --> 00:19:51.840
and join Jun An?

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:53.760
If he's not cheating,

00:19:53.881 --> 00:19:55.001
your baseless suspicion

00:19:55.001 --> 00:19:56.721
will only damage your relationship.

00:19:57.641 --> 00:19:59.401
But if he cheated on you

00:19:59.401 --> 00:20:01.800
so shortly after you came to Beijing,

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:03.721
it only shows that he's unreliable

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:04.840
and wrong for you.

00:20:05.161 --> 00:20:06.001
Say bye to him.

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:17.681
If you want to go back,

00:20:17.921 --> 00:20:19.280
I'll go with you this weekend.

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:21.641
But for now,

00:20:21.721 --> 00:20:23.040
get changed, take a shower,

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:23.921
and get some sleep.

00:20:24.481 --> 00:20:26.641
He might answer your call tomorrow.

00:20:27.161 --> 00:20:28.600
It could be a misunderstanding.

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:30.161
It's entirely possible.

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:35.481
You're right.

00:20:36.241 --> 00:20:36.881
I'm staying.

00:20:37.401 --> 00:20:39.241
I've always been in charge

00:20:39.241 --> 00:20:40.360
of our relationship.

00:20:41.001 --> 00:20:42.320
My word is the supreme law

00:20:42.641 --> 00:20:43.641
over his.

00:20:44.721 --> 00:20:45.520
I trust Zhubao.

00:20:45.681 --> 00:20:46.800
He listens to me.

00:20:46.921 --> 00:20:48.161
He'd never hurt me.

00:20:49.441 --> 00:20:50.641
I must've overreacted.

00:20:55.721 --> 00:20:56.681
Go to bed.

00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:58.681
Feel free to knock on my door anytime.

00:21:04.161 --> 00:21:04.681
Jiatong.

00:21:08.481 --> 00:21:10.040
Do we have to choose

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:13.921
between career and love once we grow up?

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:19.080
If we can't achieve a balance,

00:21:19.681 --> 00:21:20.441
maybe so.

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:23.441
What would you

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:24.721
choose then?

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:43.120
Ren Jiatong.

00:21:47.681 --> 00:21:48.800
I haven't thought about it.

00:21:52.921 --> 00:21:53.481
Xiaoyu.

00:21:55.441 --> 00:21:56.560
Are you sure you're okay?

00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:58.201
I'm totally fine.

00:21:58.921 --> 00:22:00.320
Don't worry. See you tomorrow.

00:22:34.536 --> 00:22:37.992
(Jiang Chen: Asleep?)

00:22:38.312 --> 00:22:42.760
(Ren Jiatong: Not yet. Why?)

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:47.464
Hello.

00:22:48.001 --> 00:22:49.080
It's nothing urgent.

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:49.760
I just

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:51.520
saw Guo Xiaoyu's new WeChat post.

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:52.560
Something felt off.

00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:00.201
(Guo Xiaoyu: I wish everything
around me could stay this way.)

00:23:00.201 --> 00:23:00.808
What is it?

00:23:03.721 --> 00:23:04.241
It's fine.

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:06.320
You or Guo Xiaoyu?

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:07.401
We're both fine.

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:10.280
You don't have to

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:13.840
build walls around yourself.

00:23:18.401 --> 00:23:19.040
Do I do that?

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:20.080
Yes, you do.

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:21.320
You don't let anyone get close

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:22.481
and guard against all.

00:23:23.001 --> 00:23:24.001
Sometimes you should

00:23:24.001 --> 00:23:25.520
share your thoughts with people.

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:26.320
It's not a big deal.

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:27.800
It's okay to trust others.

00:23:28.681 --> 00:23:30.401
That doesn't always make you vulnerable.

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.241
It might be because

00:23:38.401 --> 00:23:40.641
I've seen people's trust
get betrayed before.

00:23:43.401 --> 00:23:45.040
But I'm not as extreme as you claim.

00:23:47.241 --> 00:23:49.280
Having lived with you for so long,

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:50.600
Guo Xiaoyu finally managed to

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:51.800
breach your defenses.

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:53.001
That's something.

00:23:54.161 --> 00:23:56.280
Are you calling at this hour
just to lecture me?

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:01.360
I'm just worried about you.

00:24:01.481 --> 00:24:02.921
She's your only friend at Jun An.

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.881
Don't mess this up.

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:09.721
Her post wasn't about me.

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:11.120
Wait.

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:12.800
Aren't we friends?

00:24:13.961 --> 00:24:14.600
No.

00:24:15.681 --> 00:24:16.721
We're

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:17.896
rivals.

00:24:20.241 --> 00:24:22.401
Because you're drawn to
those who could defeat you.

00:24:59.208 --> 00:25:01.192
(Melatonin)

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:25.441
Stop overthinking.

00:25:34.921 --> 00:25:35.760
Xiaoyu.

00:25:36.881 --> 00:25:37.760
Get up.

00:25:38.161 --> 00:25:38.921
You'll be late.

00:25:46.961 --> 00:25:47.641
Xiaoyu.

00:26:01.401 --> 00:26:02.760
Xiaoyu, where are you?

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:11.161
Hello, Xiaoyu.

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.721
Jiatong, I'm back in Hangzhou.

00:26:14.201 --> 00:26:15.161
Did you take leave?

00:26:16.441 --> 00:26:17.760
Don't worry. I messaged

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.280
Mr. Zhou for sick leave.

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:21.441
But I didn't mention Hangzhou.

00:26:22.721 --> 00:26:23.320
Jiatong,

00:26:24.441 --> 00:26:25.881
I'm not acting impulsively.

00:26:26.161 --> 00:26:28.001
I listened to you and went to bed.

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:29.681
And I took melatonin pills,

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:31.481
but still couldn't sleep.

00:26:31.721 --> 00:26:32.921
I lay wide awake,

00:26:32.921 --> 00:26:34.641
staring at the ceiling all night,

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:36.921
thinking about Zhubao.

00:26:37.481 --> 00:26:39.001
I wanted to see him immediately.

00:26:39.336 --> 00:26:40.001
You know?

00:26:40.001 --> 00:26:41.201
My heart started racing

00:26:41.681 --> 00:26:43.280
the moment I got off the plane.

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:44.201
My hands were shaking.

00:26:44.441 --> 00:26:45.760
My instincts are never wrong.

00:26:46.201 --> 00:26:47.760
Do you think he's in trouble,

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:48.481
Jiatong?

00:26:48.481 --> 00:26:49.120
Don't panic.

00:26:49.641 --> 00:26:50.560
Since you're there,

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:51.688
be it good or bad,

00:26:51.688 --> 00:26:53.280
talk it through.

00:26:53.881 --> 00:26:55.921
I'll say you have
something to attend to.

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:57.800
Come back as soon as you're done.

00:26:58.241 --> 00:26:59.961
Don't sacrifice your future for this.

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:02.360
Actually,

00:27:03.921 --> 00:27:05.040
I haven't decided

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.401
whether I should try to stay at Jun An.

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:09.961
I thought about it all night.

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.921
Maybe I made the wrong choice.

00:27:13.881 --> 00:27:14.401
Xiaoyu,

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.201
you really think

00:27:16.201 --> 00:27:17.600
you should choose Zhu Zhisheng?

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:19.961
Last night you asked me

00:27:20.481 --> 00:27:22.201
what I'd choose between career and love.

00:27:23.001 --> 00:27:25.360
Career. I'd always choose my career.

00:27:25.961 --> 00:27:27.280
I watched someone choose love,

00:27:27.721 --> 00:27:29.001
more than once.

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:31.201
But she got nothing in the end.

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:32.921
Work's different.

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:35.681
It may be the wrong choice,

00:27:35.961 --> 00:27:37.921
but I'm sure you won't regret it.

00:27:40.441 --> 00:27:41.641
Jiatong, I understand.

00:27:44.401 --> 00:27:45.040
I promise

00:27:45.721 --> 00:27:47.600
I won't make a choice I'll regret.

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:56.520
Xiaoyu?

00:27:58.600 --> 00:27:59.280
Ms. Wang.

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:03.800
Everyone,

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:06.120
the fourth round
of elimination starts today.

00:28:06.401 --> 00:28:07.401
Same rules.

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:08.401
In two weeks,

00:28:08.681 --> 00:28:09.881
the lowest scorer is out.

00:28:12.001 --> 00:28:12.961
Is everyone here?

00:28:14.241 --> 00:28:15.120
What about

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:16.840
that sharp girl?

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:19.520
Mr. Zhuang, Guo Xiaoyu is unwell.

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:20.881
She has asked for sick leave.

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:22.961
I'll relay the meeting notes.

00:28:22.961 --> 00:28:23.760
Rest assured.

00:28:25.241 --> 00:28:25.832
Zhou Nian.

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:27.881
Present the case

00:28:28.241 --> 00:28:29.681
you're handling.

00:28:29.881 --> 00:28:30.472
Okay.

00:28:31.048 --> 00:28:32.241
(Case Overview)

00:28:32.241 --> 00:28:33.320
Hangzhou Yiaiwan Tech

00:28:33.401 --> 00:28:34.921
is a major client of Jun An.

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.392
One of their employees

00:28:36.392 --> 00:28:38.641
was found unconscious
in the parking lot after work.

00:28:38.641 --> 00:28:39.201
The family

00:28:39.201 --> 00:28:41.201
isn't filing
a work-related injury claim.

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:42.881
They're demanding the company

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:45.320
cover all medical expenses directly,

00:28:45.441 --> 00:28:46.040
as well as

00:28:46.161 --> 00:28:48.481
work injury-related costs.

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:49.800
Plus compensation.

00:28:50.201 --> 00:28:50.721
Mr. Zhou.

00:28:50.984 --> 00:28:51.681
Mr. Zhuang.

00:28:51.681 --> 00:28:52.481
I have a question.

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:53.960
Go ahead.

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:54.840
To my knowledge,

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:56.320
the employee's coma is merely

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:57.681
a medical observation status.

00:28:57.921 --> 00:28:58.520
We have to

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:00.721
wait for the hospital's final diagnosis.

00:29:00.721 --> 00:29:01.520
Legally speaking,

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.921
we only assess matters
with clear outcomes.

00:29:04.001 --> 00:29:05.840
So they don't need legal representation

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:06.760
at this point, right?

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:09.120
Besides, even if the family doesn't

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:10.600
seek work injury certification,

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:12.401
the employer retains the right

00:29:12.401 --> 00:29:14.040
to pursue certification, right?

00:29:16.681 --> 00:29:17.600
I'll be in charge.

00:29:17.721 --> 00:29:18.681
I need one of you

00:29:18.681 --> 00:29:20.520
to be my assistant.

00:29:20.641 --> 00:29:21.641
We'll go to Hangzhou.

00:29:22.241 --> 00:29:23.681
Your questions were excellent.

00:29:24.001 --> 00:29:24.760
I'll provide

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.320
a comprehensive briefing

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:27.800
after I select an assistant.

00:29:28.201 --> 00:29:29.881
Mr. Zhou, I'm interested in this case.

00:29:30.161 --> 00:29:30.681
Same here.

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:33.760
Everyone's passionate.

00:29:34.481 --> 00:29:35.241
I'm glad.

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:37.401
Mr. Zhuang. Mr. Zhou.

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:39.040
I'm ranking first.

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:40.721
I'd like to request this assignment.

00:29:45.241 --> 00:29:45.760
Mr. Zhou.

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:47.201
What do you think?

00:29:47.961 --> 00:29:48.961
They're all exceptional.

00:29:49.401 --> 00:29:50.520
It's not easy to rank first

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:51.161
at Jun An.

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:52.560
Ren Jiatong.

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:55.481
Ms. Bai has praised you to me

00:29:55.881 --> 00:29:56.760
more than once.

00:29:58.520 --> 00:29:59.201
Keep it up.

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:00.921
Thank you.

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:02.280
I'll keep working hard.

00:30:09.161 --> 00:30:11.001
She's recognized by Mr. Zhuang.

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:12.600
I'm so jealous.

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:13.721
Let it go.

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:15.840
The only one rivaling Ren Jiatong

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:16.600
is Yan Fei.

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:18.241
She took second place.

00:30:26.401 --> 00:30:26.961
Congrats.

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:28.441
Stay safe in Hangzhou.

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:29.640
Thanks.

00:30:37.672 --> 00:30:40.808
(Employee Info: Zhu Zhisheng)

00:30:43.272 --> 00:30:45.192
(Name: Zhu Zhisheng)

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:57.201
You lied.

00:30:59.641 --> 00:31:01.161
Guo Xiaoyu's Weibo IP shows

00:31:01.481 --> 00:31:02.921
she's in Hangzhou, not Beijing.

00:31:05.441 --> 00:31:06.161
We need to talk.

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:08.280
About what? Want me to keep the secret?

00:31:08.641 --> 00:31:09.560
Help me this time.

00:31:09.641 --> 00:31:10.560
I'll return the favor.

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:12.721
This mutual-help arrangement
is too messy.

00:31:12.961 --> 00:31:14.401
I'd rather tell Mr. Zhuang

00:31:14.401 --> 00:31:15.320
that you lied.

00:31:15.481 --> 00:31:16.560
Then I might claim

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:17.760
this assignment.

00:31:19.441 --> 00:31:20.401
You won't do that.

00:31:23.001 --> 00:31:23.641
No, I won't.

00:31:24.161 --> 00:31:25.040
But not for your sake.

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:26.360
It's for Guo Xiaoyu.

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:28.360
She didn't reply to my message.

00:31:28.441 --> 00:31:29.401
What happened to her?

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:34.800
She's my first friend at Jun An.

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:36.241
If she's in trouble,

00:31:36.641 --> 00:31:37.520
I want to help too.

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:42.376
Come with me.

00:31:46.201 --> 00:31:47.272
Let me get this straight.

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:49.921
Guo Xiaoyu thought
her boyfriend was cheating.

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:52.080
So she took leave and went to Hangzhou.

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:54.800
Turns out that the unconscious employee

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.241
is Guo Xiaoyu's boyfriend?

00:31:56.681 --> 00:31:58.721
And we're representing Yiaiwan Tech?

00:32:00.681 --> 00:32:02.360
How come it's so entangled?

00:32:02.441 --> 00:32:03.280
Does she know yet?

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:04.481
Probably not.

00:32:04.721 --> 00:32:06.080
I haven't decided how to tell her.

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:08.641
What's so difficult about it?

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:13.360
Hello, Guo Xiaoyu.

00:32:13.441 --> 00:32:14.760
I'm with Ren Jiatong right now.

00:32:15.161 --> 00:32:16.320
How's everything going?

00:32:18.856 --> 00:32:19.600
(Guo Xiaoyu)

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:20.161
Yan Fei.

00:32:20.921 --> 00:32:22.080
Zhubao is in trouble.

00:32:22.721 --> 00:32:23.721
He's unconscious.

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:25.080
He's been

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:26.401
in the hospital for almost a week

00:32:26.401 --> 00:32:27.481
and hasn't woken up at all.

00:32:28.241 --> 00:32:28.961
Xiaoyu.

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:30.961
How are you holding up?

00:32:31.681 --> 00:32:32.641
I'm at the hospital

00:32:32.921 --> 00:32:34.080
with Ms. Wang,

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:35.280
Zhubao's mom.

00:32:36.161 --> 00:32:38.441
Xiaoyu, I'll make this short.

00:32:38.641 --> 00:32:39.641
Ms. Wang might not

00:32:39.641 --> 00:32:41.921
want to apply
for a work injury certification.

00:32:42.201 --> 00:32:43.401
She wants Yiaiwan Tech

00:32:43.721 --> 00:32:45.520
to cover all the medical expenses.

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:47.241
Plus some compensation.

00:32:47.441 --> 00:32:49.800
We are Yiaiwan Tech's legal counsel.

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:51.320
And the firm has confirmed that

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:52.721
we're handling this case.

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:54.201
Right now, you need to

00:32:54.201 --> 00:32:55.961
report the conflict of interest
to Mr. Zhou

00:32:55.961 --> 00:32:57.840
and get yourself out of this mess.

00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:58.760
Also, for now,

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:00.721
stop meeting with Zhu Zhisheng's family.

00:33:01.481 --> 00:33:02.961
I'll report to Mr. Zhou.

00:33:05.481 --> 00:33:07.600
But Zhubao is from
a single-parent household.

00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:09.360
His mom can't

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:10.320
look after him alone.

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:11.481
We need to take shifts.

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:17.360
Xiaoyu, is it worth it if Zhu Zhisheng

00:33:17.721 --> 00:33:18.681
really cheated on you?

00:33:19.441 --> 00:33:21.201
I just want him to wake up.

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:23.040
I don't care about anything else.

00:33:23.401 --> 00:33:24.520
I just don't understand.

00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:26.120
How did everything change

00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:27.760
in just over a month?

00:33:28.001 --> 00:33:29.120
A perfectly healthy man

00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:30.921
is now lying in a hospital bed.

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:33.280
I've known him for over a decade

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:34.560
and dated him for four years.

00:33:34.961 --> 00:33:36.560
Even if he fell for someone else,

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:38.721
our feelings for each other were real.

00:33:38.721 --> 00:33:39.961
I can't just abandon him.

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:41.080
But

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:43.481
how are you going to help him now?

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:44.800
It's way too complicated.

00:33:45.161 --> 00:33:46.481
Don't do anything foolish.

00:33:46.481 --> 00:33:48.201
You'll only get yourself in trouble.

00:33:49.001 --> 00:33:50.921
Xiaoyu, listen to me.

00:33:51.201 --> 00:33:52.080
Remember

00:33:52.401 --> 00:33:54.560
what you told me
during the Warm Nest case?

00:33:54.921 --> 00:33:56.520
Win-win is the best outcome.

00:33:56.921 --> 00:33:58.520
We understand how you feel.

00:33:58.641 --> 00:34:00.120
But you've got to protect yourself.

00:34:09.288 --> 00:34:11.400
(Conflict of Interest)

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:13.576
(Lawyers must not
represent clients in cases)

00:34:13.576 --> 00:34:16.584
(where there is a conflict of interest
with themselves or their law firm.)

00:34:20.481 --> 00:34:21.600
She's not in a good place.

00:34:23.361 --> 00:34:24.321
The past few days

00:34:24.321 --> 00:34:25.680
have hit her way too hard.

00:34:25.736 --> 00:34:26.401
She even asked

00:34:26.401 --> 00:34:28.200
if she had made the wrong choice.

00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:29.560
I think she regretted

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:31.120
joining the Talent Hunt Program.

00:34:31.441 --> 00:34:33.040
If she starts blaming herself

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:34.240
for Zhu Zhisheng's coma,

00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:36.441
no one can stop her downward spiral

00:34:36.761 --> 00:34:37.881
into guilt.

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:39.961
Why is it her fault?

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:41.600
How is any of this her fault?

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:44.281
Why are women so prone to reflection?

00:34:44.281 --> 00:34:45.720
She did absolutely nothing wrong.

00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:46.841
She's brilliant.

00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:49.120
Why is she reflecting on herself?

00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:50.481
What's there to reflect on?

00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:53.321
Didn't Zhu Zhisheng
prioritize his career?

00:34:53.401 --> 00:34:54.240
He didn't choose

00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:55.841
to come to Beijing for Guo Xiaoyu.

00:34:56.232 --> 00:34:56.841
Listen.

00:34:56.841 --> 00:34:57.961
We must stop her

00:34:57.961 --> 00:34:59.361
from doing anything foolish.

00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:01.200
If nobody can stop her, I will.

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:04.520
If I were Guo Xiaoyu.

00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:05.680
I wouldn't choose Zhubao.

00:35:07.361 --> 00:35:07.961
I'd choose you.

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:11.080
No offense.

00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:12.361
But I don't date lawyers.

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:13.361
No thanks.

00:35:13.361 --> 00:35:14.160
I'm off to work.

00:35:23.321 --> 00:35:25.520
Mr. Zhuang, I spent all day researching

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:27.841
labor dispute cases
between companies and employees,

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:30.680
especially work injury
compensation claims.

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:32.321
And I did preliminary research

00:35:32.321 --> 00:35:33.921
on Yiaiwan's case.

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:35.881
Plus, my classmate from the UK

00:35:35.881 --> 00:35:38.120
is working at their legal department.

00:35:38.441 --> 00:35:40.520
If you could give me this opportunity,

00:35:40.841 --> 00:35:42.200
I promise I'll contribute

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.040
to this case.

00:35:44.881 --> 00:35:45.841
You did well.

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:49.040
I truly admire your initiative
in seizing opportunities.

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:52.120
I know my brother came to see you

00:35:52.281 --> 00:35:53.801
about my career path.

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:56.160
But the fact that I'm standing here now

00:35:56.321 --> 00:35:58.600
proves you're fair
and impartial, Mr. Zhuang.

00:35:58.881 --> 00:36:00.720
You didn't eliminate me because of him.

00:36:01.321 --> 00:36:03.401
You owe it to your own efforts.

00:36:03.761 --> 00:36:04.680
We have no reason

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:06.401
to eliminate a talented employee.

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:09.841
So I'm not here

00:36:09.881 --> 00:36:11.881
to ask for privileges.

00:36:11.961 --> 00:36:13.801
I'm here to earn this opportunity

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:15.801
through my hard work.

00:36:16.321 --> 00:36:16.961
You know

00:36:16.961 --> 00:36:18.680
I've always wanted to
join Mr. Song's team.

00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:20.200
This is a rare chance.

00:36:20.321 --> 00:36:22.640
I want to prove my capabilities
through this case.

00:36:34.801 --> 00:36:35.841
Not bad.

00:36:36.401 --> 00:36:37.600
Full of doubt yesterday

00:36:37.761 --> 00:36:38.961
and determined today.

00:36:39.961 --> 00:36:41.841
Mr. Zhou, I don't think a senior lawyer

00:36:41.841 --> 00:36:44.560
should act like
he's spying on his colleagues.

00:36:44.801 --> 00:36:46.001
When did I spy on you?

00:36:46.321 --> 00:36:47.481
I don't think you should

00:36:47.481 --> 00:36:49.001
speak to a senior lawyer without

00:36:49.001 --> 00:36:49.520
respect.

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:53.768
Mr. Zhou.

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:56.761
I've been thinking about

00:36:56.761 --> 00:36:58.001
what you asked me yesterday.

00:36:59.401 --> 00:37:00.680
But I haven't figured it out.

00:37:01.881 --> 00:37:03.600
But it may not be a good thing

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:04.841
to have every answer, right?

00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:06.841
Right now, I just want this opportunity

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:08.680
to join Mr. Song's team.

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:10.520
I'll get by for now.

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:11.160
Someday,

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:12.600
I'll figure out what I want.

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:13.881
I'm impressed.

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:15.720
A bottle of champagne for celebration.

00:37:16.441 --> 00:37:18.080
Sorry, but I've quit drinking.

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:19.881
Alcohol doesn't solve everything.

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:21.921
Plus, there's alcohol poisoning.

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:22.792
It's not worth it.

00:37:23.281 --> 00:37:24.801
But I've gotten into boxing now.

00:37:24.841 --> 00:37:25.761
More competitive.

00:37:25.921 --> 00:37:27.656
It feels great,
just like being a lawyer.

00:37:29.361 --> 00:37:30.560
I dare not cross you now.

00:37:31.001 --> 00:37:32.680
I'm a law graduate after all.

00:37:32.881 --> 00:37:34.361
I wouldn't resort to violence.

00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:36.264
Fair enough.

00:37:38.361 --> 00:37:39.200
But to be honest,

00:37:40.281 --> 00:37:41.080
I must thank you

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:42.560
for grilling me yesterday.

00:37:42.921 --> 00:37:43.560
Otherwise,

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:45.240
I'd be convinced that I was worthless.

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.080
Then I wouldn't go boxing.

00:37:47.961 --> 00:37:48.801
Join me sometime.

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:50.680
I respect you as a senior.

00:37:50.761 --> 00:37:53.200
But in the ring, winners make the rules.

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:54.696
Alright.

00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:55.680
Deal.

00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:58.321
One ground rule.

00:37:59.001 --> 00:37:59.720
Not in the face.

00:38:00.321 --> 00:38:00.881
I have barely

00:38:00.881 --> 00:38:02.801
used any cosmetics in 30 years.

00:38:02.881 --> 00:38:04.040
A fist imprint on it

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:05.961
would tarnish my glorious image.

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:07.600
No promises.

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:09.281
But I'll try not to hit too hard.

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:19.200
What's going on?

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:20.560
So mysterious.

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:21.600
I've got an idea.

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:22.921
But I need you

00:38:23.001 --> 00:38:24.560
to work with me.

00:38:24.961 --> 00:38:25.600
Are you in?

00:38:28.921 --> 00:38:30.160
This round is just starting.

00:38:31.001 --> 00:38:32.321
We're falling way behind.

00:38:32.441 --> 00:38:34.001
Ren Jiatong and Yan Fei might team up

00:38:34.001 --> 00:38:34.841
in Hangzhou.

00:38:35.321 --> 00:38:36.321
We'll be efficient

00:38:36.321 --> 00:38:37.281
as a team of three.

00:38:37.761 --> 00:38:38.401
What do you say?

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:44.321
I'm on board.

00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:47.600
What's your plan?

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:53.080
The defendant

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:54.520
sent this to the plaintiff.

00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:55.520
I noticed this.

00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:56.424
(From Fei Chang Ke Xin)

00:38:56.424 --> 00:38:57.080
(No. 16, Zhaoxia South Road,
Chaoyang District)

00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:58.640
A corner of the express delivery slip.

00:38:58.761 --> 00:38:59.481
The courier

00:38:59.481 --> 00:39:01.120
is located in the Chaoyang District.

00:39:01.481 --> 00:39:02.680
I suspect it's near

00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:04.520
the defendant's address of operations.

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:07.120
So you're saying

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:08.801
that if we prove

00:39:08.801 --> 00:39:10.160
their actual operating address

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:11.160
is in Beijing,

00:39:12.001 --> 00:39:13.720
their challenge of jurisdiction

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:14.361
won't stand.

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:15.208
That's right.

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:16.392
Okay.

00:39:18.001 --> 00:39:19.240
But it's very difficult.

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:21.680
That's why we need to work together.

00:39:22.481 --> 00:39:23.600
The map apps have

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:24.801
a "nearby search" function.

00:39:24.921 --> 00:39:26.321
I once developed a mini-program.

00:39:26.481 --> 00:39:27.240
I can modify it now

00:39:27.481 --> 00:39:29.240
to compile a list
of all office buildings

00:39:29.401 --> 00:39:31.200
within two kilometers

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:32.520
of this courier station.

00:39:32.921 --> 00:39:34.001
We'll search together.

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:41.544
(Hangzhou Xiaoshan Airport)

00:39:53.321 --> 00:39:54.761
I booked a car. Cancel yours.

00:39:56.841 --> 00:39:58.160
I'm joining the negotiation.

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:02.001
It's here.

00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:09.281
I know what you're thinking.

00:40:09.401 --> 00:40:10.361
But I earned

00:40:10.361 --> 00:40:12.120
this opportunity fair and square.

00:40:12.281 --> 00:40:13.921
I paid to upgrade to business class,

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:15.680
and I paid for this ride too.

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:17.832
I didn't know Mr. Zhou
wasn't on our flight,

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:20.001
or I would have ordered a smaller one.

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:20.841
What a waste.

00:40:21.881 --> 00:40:23.680
Are you rushing to explain everything

00:40:23.841 --> 00:40:25.961
because I mind it,
or because you mind it?

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:28.560
I used to mind it a lot,

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:30.640
but recently someone told me

00:40:30.761 --> 00:40:32.240
that if I know what I want,

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:34.160
utilizing all available resources

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:35.120
is a good thing.

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:36.168
What do you say?

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:39.361
I thought you came to Hangzhou
for Guo Xiaoyu.

00:40:39.761 --> 00:40:40.801
It is for Guo Xiaoyu,

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:42.281
but also for myself.

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:45.640
I'm tired of losing

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:47.040
at Jun An,

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:48.680
especially

00:40:49.921 --> 00:40:51.001
to you.

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:03.001
You're pretty cute like this.

00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:16.720
Why are you alone? Where's Mr. Zhou?

00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:19.200
He was needed for a meeting

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:20.801
right before boarding.

00:41:20.921 --> 00:41:22.160
He switched to the last flight.

00:41:22.281 --> 00:41:24.001
So we can only meet with Yiaiwan Tech

00:41:24.001 --> 00:41:25.281
tomorrow morning.

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:26.921
Straight to the hotel?

00:41:28.401 --> 00:41:29.481
It's half an hour away.

00:41:29.481 --> 00:41:31.321
Let's go over the case.

00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:32.761
In the car?

00:41:35.001 --> 00:41:36.281
Aren't we doing a job

00:41:36.281 --> 00:41:37.481
where all we need is a laptop

00:41:37.481 --> 00:41:39.160
to start working anytime, anywhere?

00:41:41.001 --> 00:41:43.560
Why does that sound so familiar?

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:46.720
Ms. Bai's exact words from an interview?

00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:54.801
Oh, someone at Yiaiwan told me

00:41:54.801 --> 00:41:55.801
that Zhu's mother had

00:41:55.801 --> 00:41:57.680
approached their management
several times.

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:00.001
But what puzzles me is,

00:42:00.001 --> 00:42:01.680
if she believes this is a work injury,

00:42:01.881 --> 00:42:03.600
she could've applied

00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:06.160
to the Social Security authorities.

00:42:06.321 --> 00:42:07.441
Then she can claim

00:42:07.441 --> 00:42:09.520
work injury compensation right away.

00:42:09.881 --> 00:42:11.240
Why did she rush to negotiate

00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:13.120
compensation with Yiaiwan?

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:15.040
You know people at Yiaiwan?

00:42:15.401 --> 00:42:16.120
Yeah.

00:42:16.401 --> 00:42:17.881
I meant it when I told you

00:42:17.881 --> 00:42:19.281
that I'm sick of losing

00:42:19.281 --> 00:42:20.160
at Jun An.

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:25.560
She pulled all of Zhu Zhisheng's

00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:26.841
clock-in records,

00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:28.680
claiming he worked overtime daily.

00:42:29.001 --> 00:42:30.481
So she insists that

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:31.520
his coma was caused

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:33.720
by chronic work exhaustion.

00:42:33.921 --> 00:42:36.481
The day before yesterday,
she sat for hours outside the company.

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:37.921
But Yiaiwan

00:42:37.921 --> 00:42:39.640
is at a critical pre-IPO stage.

00:42:39.881 --> 00:42:41.120
They can't afford scandals.

00:42:41.441 --> 00:42:44.441
No wonder they rushed us to Hangzhou.

00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:45.961
I knew they wouldn't need

00:42:45.961 --> 00:42:48.160
lawyers to step in at this moment.

00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:49.200
Their HR should be able

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:50.160
to handle this.

00:42:50.401 --> 00:42:51.560
So that's what's going on.

00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:54.001
If this happened
at your family's company,

00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:55.321
how would you handle it?

00:42:55.761 --> 00:42:58.240
Our company treats employees very well.

00:43:00.001 --> 00:43:01.040
Do you think

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:03.200
Yiaiwan exploited its employees,

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:06.040
or is Zhu Zhisheng's mother using this

00:43:06.361 --> 00:43:08.240
to demand huge compensation?

00:43:09.001 --> 00:43:10.321
Don't try trapping me.

00:43:10.441 --> 00:43:11.640
I didn't say anything.

00:43:15.528 --> 00:43:16.936
(Jurisdictional Objection)

00:43:16.936 --> 00:43:18.632
(A jurisdictional objection
is when a party argues)

00:43:18.632 --> 00:43:20.264
(that the court handling their case
is not the right one.)

00:43:20.264 --> 00:43:21.800
(They ask to move the case
to the proper court,)

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:23.240
(usually within the time limit
for responding to the lawsuit.)

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:24.744
(This is often used as a legal tactic)

00:43:24.744 --> 00:43:26.408
(to delay the case
or seek a more favorable location.)

00:43:26.408 --> 00:43:28.008
(Objections must be raised
during the defense submission period.)
