00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.280
Why do you both smell like alcohol?

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:08.480
Warm?

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.520
I just didn’t want you to know

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.000
that we were alone together.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.360
Ice!

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.160
Imagine if I didn’t have a boyfriend,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.400
how would you kiss me then?

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.000
I think I need to stop

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.520
seeing you in such a bad light.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.200
Then I guess

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.840
I’ll keep letting my face get punched up and bruised,

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.200
just in case it helps me win your heart.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.440
This is my apology gift.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.160
You and Lanee are getting married.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.400
Me and Mrs. Jan have already planned everything.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.240
Check if Saint’s been

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.480
messaging anyone suspicious.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.320
Wait? Why is Ice with Professor Mint?

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.320
Where are you going?

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.320
I going out.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.320
No.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.400
Mr.Khom gave his orders.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.680
There's something really important

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.000
I really need to get to.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.160
Is it about Ice?

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.640
The something important?

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.560
You should know.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.400
Then can you tell me

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.320
what happened to Ice?

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.520
Maybe your father would also like to know.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Come on in.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.280
Did you come to see me for something?

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.640
I just wanted to ask you about Acting for Film.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.200
If I want to act in a film noir,

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.680
how should I do it?

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:46.079
Can you teach me?

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.040
Of course.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.280
But why not ask in class or at the university?

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.240
Because here,

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.960
it’s just the two of us,

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.840
and we can truly be ourselves.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.400
Right, professor?

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.000
Ten!

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.520
Shit.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.160
You need a keycard.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.880
What do we do?

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.240
I think there are only two ways.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.400
We either steal a keycard,

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.240
or wait for someone to come in or out

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.880
and sneak in.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.680
We should wait for someone to open the door.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.120
Don’t tell me.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.280
I think we should just steal it.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.079
I knew it, you bastard.

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:35.760
No.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.000
You’re going to steal her keycard?

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.120
How could you even think of that?

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.200
Otherwise we can’t get up there.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.079
We can’t. Excuse me, sir.

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:40.840
Let’s just..

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.040
Which room are you visiting?

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.440
I don’t know, I’m here to see a friend.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.480
Then please call your friend

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.800
to come down and get you.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.920
I already did, but he’s not picking up.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.520
Then you can’t go in.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.200
Please step aside.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.880
Tch.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:54.600
Fine.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.840
I’ll just ask the cashier.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.480
They call it the front desk.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.760
Right this way.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:00.560
Thanks.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.440
Excuse me, miss,

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.360
do you know which room Ice

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.640
went to meet Professor Mint?

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.480
Who? Ice, my friend.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.320
Uh..

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.440
Right, which room is

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.280
Assistant Professor Dr. Pruk staying in?

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.760
I’m sorry, but we can’t contact guests directly

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.080
if you don’t know their room number.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.680
It’s for their privacy protection.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.399
I understand,

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:20.920
but my friend might be in danger right now.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.640
I need to go see him immediately.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.480
It’s really serious.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.000
Yeah,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.360
what if he’s being assaulted?

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.960
We’ll have security check first,

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.640
but I suggest you file a police report.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.000
And have the police come here.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.440
If you’re only saying this without proof,

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.920
we can’t let you into the building.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.920
What the hell?

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.080
Really can’t, huh?

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.680
No, sir.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.280
Hello?

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.000
Yeah.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.640
They’re not letting me in.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.080
What should we do?

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.000
You stay by the lobby.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.480
If Professor Mint or Ice comes down,

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.680
call me right away.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.240
Ice is in danger.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.920
You didn’t know, did you, Aunt Bua?

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.840
That last time, when you locked me up,

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.640
you have no idea how awful Ice felt.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.040
He tried to kill himself.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.160
And you were part of the reason

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.840
I couldn’t save him in time.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.440
If you try to stop me again this time,

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.480
even if I have to use force, I’ll do it.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.320
I’ll do it.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.360
Everyone, come to me on the second floor.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.600
Now.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.120
Please go back to your room, Saint.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.200
I just missed you, professor.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.320
Oh?

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.600
I thought...

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.080
you didn’t want to see me anymore.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Why wouldn’t I?

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.520
Because...

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.720
I’m not the only one you have now.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.960
Just the other day

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.480
I saw you and Alex together.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.840
I could barely stand it, professor.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:41.840
Hey...

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.480
what kind of person do you think I am?

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.480
Huh?

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.600
I told you I don’t like you,

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.000
and I don’t like Alex either.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.320
Are you still trying to flirt with me?

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.680
But professor,

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.280
it’s just the two of us here.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.640
You don’t need to lie to yourself.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.320
Please.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.840
Listen.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.640
Just because you’re good-looking

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.320
doesn’t mean everyone who likes you

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.360
wants to sleep with you.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.840
Huh?

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:16.600
Ice.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.800
I have a wife.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.520
And my child died because of you.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.440
Wasn't it because of you?

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.640
Why are you talking like I’m the villain here?

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.880
Then why did you follow me?

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.520
To ruin my family again and again?

00:07:34.159 --> 00:07:36.159
Just because I didn’t want to sleep with you?

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.600
I gave you the chance to start a new life!

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.640
What new life?!

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.640
My life’s ruined because of scum like you.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.080
Did you forget

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.440
what you did to me?

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.200
Hey!

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.120
Are you high?

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.320
Get a hold of yourself!

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.600
Go home!!

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:56.600
Hello?

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.760
Please come to my room.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.040
Someone’s trying to assault me.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.400
Ouch!

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.160
Get out!

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.480
What’s going on?

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.080
I heard you talking to Saint earlier.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.120
You were being loud.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:12.960
Oh…

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.840
We were just talking about him going out.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.240
But he changed his mind.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.200
He’s practicing his script in the room.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.520
Where was he going?

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.600
To see a friend.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.240
Then I’ll go check on him.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.320
Um, sir...

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Sir?

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:47.840
Saint,

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.520
are you asleep?

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.520
Uh…

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.240
I’m practicing lines,

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.480
dad. Is there something wrong?

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.560
I want to talk about today.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.040
Can I come in?

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.560
Uh…

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.440
Can we talk tomorrow?

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.000
I’m really tired today.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.120
Sir?

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.320
Maybe tomorrow?

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.560
Let him have a little time to himself.

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:32.560
Hmm.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:33.920
Alright then.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.360
We’ll talk tomorrow morning.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.000
Yes.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.600
Good night dad.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.320
Good night.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.680
Thank you.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.560
How many lives have you ruined?

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.040
Just wait!!

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.400
I’m the one who’s going to expose you

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.560
and that disgusting slaughter room too!

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.640
I’ll ruin your entire life!

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.760
Expose me for what?

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.120
You came into my room.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.200
You flirted with me, wanted me to sleep with you.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.640
When I refused, you attacked me.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.040
And this isn’t even the first time.

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.520
It’s the third!

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.720
Think about who’s really going to lose their future.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.880
Excuse me.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.000
The front desk told me to come check.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:10.000
Do you need any help, sir?

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.400
Help me.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.240
Please call the police.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.240
Help me!

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.880
Help me!

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.040
Sir.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:26.880
It’s fine, everything’s okay.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:27.640
Thank you.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:32.160
Sorry for disturbing your rest.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:37.360
Zoom.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:22.120
I could teach you, you know.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.600
About acting or about camera work.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.360
But you and I, we’re built different.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.680
Zoom.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:38.800
Why the hell did you help him?

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.240
Didn’t you say

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.240
you wanted to start a new life?

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:52.720
You’re graduating in a few months,

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.720
you’ll finally be free.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.080
So choose...

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.360
how you want your life to end.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.240
I want to start a new life.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:08.880
Good.

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:12.000
Every other student who’s slept with me.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.880
Whether for grades or whatever reason.

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:16.960
If you...

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:20.080
interfere with my life even once more,

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:23.920
the videos and photos of you with me

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:25.920
will be leaked instantly.

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:29.000
If you want his life to end up like yours.

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:30.800
Fine.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:34.080
But remember, it’ll be because of you.

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:37.560
Okay.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:43.040
That’s it for today’s Film Noir class.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.040
Let’s go.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:06.840
When’s he coming?

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.080
I want to know that too.

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:11.440
Hey.

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.560
Ice’s here, Mud.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:15.840
Ice,

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.920
what were you doing just now?

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:19.920
Why did you meet Professor Mint alone?

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:20.840
Did he do something to you?

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:23.520
I’m fine.

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.040
Didn’t I tell you before?

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.520
If something happens, tell me?

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.280
Why do you always act like you’re on your own?

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:31.600
Mud.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:32.760
Calm down, man.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:33.800
Just calm down.

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:35.320
Wait.

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.320
You okay?

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.480
You don’t look okay at all.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.320
Want us to take you home?

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.440
Ice!

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:55.960
Are you hurt anywhere?

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:31.080
(Is it still me that you love?)

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:37.760
(Can it still be me that you miss?)

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.280
Can you take me somewhere?

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.040
Anywhere.

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.800
I want to go somewhere quiet.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.800
Where it's only me and you.

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:31.160
(can it still be me that you love?)

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:37.480
(I still hold on to every promise,)

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:41.520
(my heart wants to hold you like yesterday.)

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:45.000
(Change these cold nights)

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.040
(and bring us back to where we belong.)

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:53.440
(That's all I want to ask.)

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:05.160
(Private Property: No Trespassing)

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:20.000
We're here.

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:49.400
Where the hell did you bring me?

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.000
Chanthaburi province.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.720
You're bringing me to someone else's property,

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.280
aren't they going to shoot us?

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.360
The owner is kind,

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:03.720
they won't shoot.

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:07.960
Talking about heavy stuff,

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.400
shouldn’t we go to a pretty location?

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.600
Even if the topic’s not fun,

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:14.920
if it’s cinematic,

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:18.440
it might be a scene people remember.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:20.480
Where did you learn that?

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.840
I want to be a cameraman.

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.360
Don’t I need to know a few things then?

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:41.200
Ice?

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.280
Can I ask you something?

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.080
You went to see Prof.Mint alone

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:50.840
because you didn’t want to drag us into this, right?

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.960
When will you realize

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.760
how important you are to me?

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.440
And there’s Sea

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:07.960
and the other friends too.

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:11.640
I’m used to handling this kind of stuff alone.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.760
Then get used to having me in your life.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.680
Let’s find a solution together.

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:21.120
But…

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:24.840
Don’t put yourself at risk alone again.

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:27.760
Okay?

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.000
Promise.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.400
Sure.

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.600
No matter what,

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.400
I want you to know

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.960
that I’ll always be by your side.

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.600
As a friend or whatever.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.080
Come on.

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:17.400
What are you doing?

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:19.280
Well…

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:20.920
If we came to the lake,

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.640
we should at least dip our feet in, right?

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:25.480
No way.

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:27.920
I only have one pair of underwear.

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:31.440
You can buy underwear around here.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.240
Come on.

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:39.720
Come on.

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:41.760
Hurry, get in.

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.920
The water is freezing.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000
Yeah!

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.480
Buy me new underwear too!

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:00.880
Hey, come on.

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:01.600
Quickly!

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.480
No, don’t!

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:48.360
What are you guys doing here?!

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.400
Hey.!

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:52.520
How did everyone end up here?

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.400
Saint posted a close-friends post

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.720
and captioned it..

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:57.640
Two people

00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.800
this spot, right here.

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:01.360
It's here.

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:02.080
Good thing

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:04.440
Book and I came to Saint’s private lake before,

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:06.840
otherwise how would we find it?

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:09.200
This is more than a sasaeng tour.

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:13.360
This is your private lake?

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:15.200
Yeah.

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:18.280
Hmm.

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:20.280
You came without telling your friends.

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.280
Leaving me and Lanee to deal with your dad.

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:24.720
He grilled us, asking where did you and your car go?

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.040
Don’t glare at him so hard.

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:30.520
Only Lanee and I are in the close-friends list.

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:31.440
What?

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.480
Why don’t I have you on my close-friends list?

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:34.280
You still asking?

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:36.080
You can’t keep a secret.

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:37.480
You’re the same. Huh?

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:38.000
Hey.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.280
You missed!

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:39.880
Hey! Ah!

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:41.160
You missed! Hey! What's that?

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.280
Did you think I’d fall into a trap..

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:45.800
My ears are ringing!

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:48.120
Actually Lanee and I were only coming.

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.000
But when I was about to come out,

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.280
Mud followed.

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:53.280
I wasn't following you.

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:56.480
I just came to check if Ice was really okay.

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:57.560
Same here.

00:22:58.640 --> 00:22:59.720
I’m okay now.

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:01.360
Good.

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:04.320
Next time don’t do that alone, Ice.

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:07.240
If anything happens tell us.

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.960
We’re always ready to help.

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:09.920
Thanks.

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.400
Since everyone’s in Chanthaburi anyway,

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.400
and today is my birthday,

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:20.000
shall we throw a beach party?

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.440
Yes!

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:25.160
Then let’s set it up now.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.200
Book.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.600
Help me organize the party.

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:30.480
Sure.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.320
Ice, can you sing at the birthday party?

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:34.600
Sure.

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:39.160
Party! Party!

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:41.680
Hey Book, I’m coming with you, okay?

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:44.640
I’m single now.

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:47.280
I’m ready to be your best friend again.

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:51.800
Oh really?

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:54.600
Sorry bro,

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:56.760
I’m not single…

00:23:58.520 --> 00:23:59.600
Friend.

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:03.040
Alright, shall we head to the sea

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:05.520
before it gets too late?

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:07.920
Let’s go.

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:11.640
Me and Ice will go buy a gift for you first.

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.160
Do you want to go?

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.720
How will it be a surprise?

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.720
If you take her with you to buy it?

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:19.400
Go ahead.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:20.800
Ok.

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.000
See ya.

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.760
I’m going to the beach now.

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:27.040
I want to go to the sea.

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:28.240
Mud, go.

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.800
Why are you just standing there?

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:25.960
Hey.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.760
So, what’s Lanee like?

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:31.200
She’s lovely,

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:33.880
optimistic,

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:36.480
compassionate, crybaby-ish,

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.680
and very strong

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:41.480
Why do you ask?

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:43.240
No reason.

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:46.040
Just to know what suits her.

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:49.160
And suits what?

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.720
Maybe someone like you.

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:56.560
Hey, Ice.

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:57.760
Anyway,

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:01.400
I don’t want to know about you and your girlfriend.

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:03.800
I already have enough to worry about.

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.560
But you two do make a good match.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.760
Family, status, and personality.

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:17.360
Then shall we get that mermaid cake?

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:19.640
I saw Lanee likes mermaids.

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.280
Good.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:23.360
Excuse me.

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:26.920
Please get that mermaid cake.

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:27.960
Okay.

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:28.640
Thank you.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:34.520
How did you know she likes mermaids?

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:37.320
Her wallpapers,

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:39.360
keychains, and things like that.

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:40.440
Wow.

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.400
Paying that much attention to other people

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:45.400
That other person is your girlfriend, you know.

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.360
Ice.

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.800
Me and Lanee..

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:02.240
What are you doing?

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:17.040
Why did you come out here together?

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:19.160
Didn’t you think to invite your own boyfriend?

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:20.320
Huh?

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:25.520
I came for Lanee and Saint’s birthday party.

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:27.440
The party is today.

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:29.840
I saw it on the GPS.

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:31.640
You’ve been here since last night, weren’t you?

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:35.960
Huh?

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:39.040
Don’t you know what happened to Ice last night?

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:44.240
What happened?

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.280
It’s not important.

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:51.480
I was busy with making music last night.

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:53.520
Hey Ice.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.320
I have something to show you.

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:58.480
Have you checked social media yet?

00:27:58.480 --> 00:27:59.440
Open it.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.360
Quick.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.880
Can you see that I finally did it?

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:21.080
I told you it takes time.

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:25.880
But sorry I couldn’t talk with you earlier.

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.320
I fixed the problem now.

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.160
People are praising you,

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:33.960
saying you’re handsome and talented.

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:34.840
Yeah.

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.920
You said you had something to clear up with me.

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:39.120
What was it about?

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.080
Oh...

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.520
This place isn’t very private, huh?

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:48.720
It’s fine.

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:51.120
We can talk later, just the two of us.

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:55.280
For now, let’s eat first.

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.920
This meal’s on me.

00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:59.160
I even ordered your favorite,

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:01.080
grilled pork neck salad.

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:02.320
Come on, eat up.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
Everything’s so spicy though.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.160
Can you handle it?

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:07.120
Should I order something else?

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:08.680
If you can’t eat spicy, don’t force yourself.

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.000
Then maybe just let me

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.200
and Ice eat together, the two of us.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.400
You can go find something else to eat.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.600
I can handle spicy food.

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:21.160
If it means I get to eat with him,

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:23.440
it’s better than letting him eat alone

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.080
while you go find something else.

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.400
What do you mean by that?

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:30.080
Are you sure you want me to say it?

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:34.760
Miss Lanee's cake is ready now.

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:36.840
Please pick it up at the counter.

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:39.800
Warm.

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:41.800
I think you should go back first.

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:44.160
I’ll call you once I’m back in Bangkok.

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.160
Come on, Saint.

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:48.320
The cake’s ready, let’s go.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000
Wait.

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.960
Lanee.

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.720
The daughter of the TQB owner,

00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.760
Saint’s girlfriend, right?

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:01.440
Where is she?

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:05.560
Wherever she is, it’s none of your business.

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:09.560
Ice,

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.400
if I say I want to stay here a bit longer,

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:14.680
you wouldn’t mind, would you?

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.200
Up to you.

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:17.040
Wherever you go,

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:19.120
it’s never had anything to do with me anyway.

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:21.480
Once I’m back in Bangkok,

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:23.080
I’ll come see you, okay?

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:25.200
Come on, Saint.

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:26.680
Let’s go.

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:01.520
Happy birthday, Lanee.

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:02.600
Thank you.

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:04.080
Take a picture for us?

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:05.600
Wow, it’s been so long! I missed you!

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:06.480
I missed you too!

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:07.320
You’ve gotten prettier.

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:07.920
Oh.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:09.080
I'm gonna go flirt for a bit.

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:10.520
Sure, sure.

00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:13.360
Wow, your friends are something else, Lanee.

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:17.600
Man, I wish I were at least a quarter as rich as Lanee.

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:19.360
Birthday party by the beach,

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:21.080
inviting almost everyone in the university

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:22.360
and even arranging transport for them!

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:23.280
Damn.

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:28.800
So jealous.

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:30.400
Hey,

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:32.520
what’s up with you lately?

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:34.040
You’re acting all weird.

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:34.920
Nothing’s wrong with me.

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:36.480
Weird.

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:38.200
Saint.

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:44.280
Happy birthday, Lanee.

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:46.000
Thank you.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:46.880
Let’s just chill today.

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:47.800
Eat whatever you want.

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:48.840
Sure.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:50.920
How have you been?

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:52.160
Hmm.

00:31:58.640 --> 00:31:59.520
Hey guys.

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:02.320
This is Prite.

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:04.200
He studies economics.

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:05.240
Hi.

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:07.160
Your name’s Mud, right?

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:08.640
Ice.

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:10.360
Book talks about you a lot.

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:11.280
Play it for me.

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:12.600
Okay.

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:15.520
Hey Mud,

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:19.160
Prite’s still talking to you.

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:23.480
I think I haven’t tuned this properly yet.

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:24.880
I don’t think I can play it right now.

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:26.960
Prite, let’s go sit over there.

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:35.320
Ice.

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:36.560
Hi, Pas.

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:37.880
Oh, Hello Pas.

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:39.680
Are you two performing for Lanee's birthday?

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:41.520
Yeah. Hmm.

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.520
Do you want to come join us?

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:45.000
Nah, I think tonight

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.880
you should be the main star.

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:49.160
But if you need help with anything, just tell me.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.640
So, did you tell him yet

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:53.480
that we’re not actually together,

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:55.440
that your dad just forced you?

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:57.440
I’m still looking for the right time.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.400
The sound... Hmm.

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.160
Better hurry before

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:04.120
someone else finds the right time first.

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:08.440
Yes, coach.

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:10.000
And what about you?

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.040
Have you asked that person over there yet?

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:13.600
I asked in a general and broad way.

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:16.440
Posted an open invite to everyone in the faculty.

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:17.960
Didn’t message directly.

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:19.320
Careful, she might not get the hint.

00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:20.600
Yes, coach.

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:28.320
This should be about right, right?

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:33.200
I’ll go refill this.

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.000
Be right back.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000
Thanks.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.239
The next song, I’d like to dedicate to Lanee.

00:34:52.239 --> 00:34:54.840
Wishing you lots of happiness.

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:59.480
Happy birthday to you,

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:03.360
Happy birthday to you,

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:08.200
Happy birthday, happy birthday,

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:13.760
Happy birthday to you!

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:20.040
And now, let’s have the groom,

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:20.800
oops!

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:22.520
I mean, the host, make a wish!

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:27.840
I wish you lots of happiness

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:30.200
and good health.

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.080
May all your wishes in love come true.

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:34.800
Whoever you like or love, I hope it works out.

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:36.080
Thank you.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.000
Woohoo!

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:58.360
Kiss! Kiss!

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:04.240
So cute!

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:07.040
I’ll send it to you later.

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:10.560
Birthday girl, what song would you like to hear?

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:12.360
All I Can Do Is Dream, please.

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:14.360
You got it.

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:20.040
(Wake up in the same old room again.)

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:23.360
(Stuck in this place, )

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:28.880
(about to make the same mistakes all over again.)

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:35.680
(Wake up to find that reality is...)

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:38.240
(I can only see you in dreams, )

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:40.920
(because the clock hands between us )

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:44.000
(move in opposite directions.)

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:47.040
(Hoooo...)

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:47.960
(No matter how hard I try,)

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:49.480
Lanee, let’s go take some photos.

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:50.280
Oh, sure!

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:54.040
(I know it’s impossible.)

00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:58.360
(Our love doesn’t exist, does it?)

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:02.160
(At least I can dream a good dream )

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:05.920
(with you by my side.)

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:10.840
(Every happy moment only happens)

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:12.680
( when I close my eyes.)

00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:16.280
(If all I get is a sweet dream,)

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:20.640
(that’s still enough because you’re here with me.)

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:26.600
(Just one more minute before we fade away.)

00:37:58.240 --> 00:37:59.360
Where’s Saint?

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:19.360
Earlier, when we were supposed to pair up for rooms,

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:21.240
I stood at the lobby for half an hour,

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:22.320
but you never showed up.

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:23.560
I called you, and you didn’t pick up.

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:24.720
What the hell were you doing?

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:27.640
I told you to wait!

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:29.280
I was finding a room for Prite first.

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:30.000
Didn’t you hear me?

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.200
I’m going to sleep with Ten, screw this!

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:31.960
Done.

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:35.080
I used to wait for you every time,

00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:36.480
but now you can’t wait for me just once?

00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:38.560
What’s wrong with you?

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:43.160
What's going on?

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:44.200
Did you two fight or something?

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.400
Hey, do you have a boyfriend yet?

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.000
I like you, okay?

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.000
Okay.

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:04.960
Everyone, keep having fun!

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:06.120
Let’s hand things over to

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:07.720
DJ Ten!

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:10.360
Woohoo!

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:12.200
Alright everyone!

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:14.160
If you’re not drunk yet, make some noise!

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:16.600
Woohoo!

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:20.840
Are you ready to party with DJ Ten’s house music?!

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:22.840
You’re really good, you know.

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:24.960
But why didn’t you sing the song you wrote?

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:26.600
I think it’s a good one.

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:27.880
Oh, come on.

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:29.000
I’d be too embarrassed.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.640
Singing in front of strangers? I’d die.

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:32.120
You won’t die.

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:34.840
I’ll sing it with you.

00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:37.080
Oh, and I’ll tell you a secret.

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:39.520
There’s going to be a big songwriting competition

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:41.560
that's going include a bunch of universities.

00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:43.000
You should be prepared.

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:46.760
Jymes Alan might even be the judge.

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:48.240
Really?!

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:49.200
Yeah. Wow!

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:50.680
I really like him!

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:52.120
If you do well,

00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:53.720
I think it'll be in the bag for you.

00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:54.920
Seriously? Yeah.

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.960
Want a drink?

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:07.720
It’s really good.

00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:08.280
What?

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:11.080
Oh, it’s finished already.

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:12.040
No worries.

00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:13.880
Ice, I’ll take you to get another glass.

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:15.120
Hey, Pas.

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.600
Don’t you know Ice already has a boyfriend?

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:18.440
Saint,

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:20.480
what’s your problem?

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:22.240
Did I do something to piss you off?

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:23.640
I’m sorry.

00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:24.840
He’s drunk.

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:26.480
He’s not usually like this.

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:28.240
Please don’t take it personally.

00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:31.200
Come on, Saint.

00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:40.560
I was talking to Pas.

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:42.040
Why’d you have to bring up my boyfriend?

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:43.320
Oh...

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:46.360
you wanted him to think you don’t have one, huh?

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:55.520
Fine…

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:56.760
Sorry.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.480
Won’t happen again.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.000
Forget it.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.000
You’re drunk.

00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:10.000
So you’ve forgiven me, right?

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:14.560
Ugh!

00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:03.960
Excuse me, can you please drive a bit faster?

00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:05.000
It’s already dark.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.760
Driving faster would be dangerous, ma’am.

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:07.440
We’re almost there.

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:08.640
Less than half an hour.

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:22.720
Alright!

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:25.440
Singles, put your hands up!

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:28.720
Woohoo!

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:30.240
Who’s single?!

00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:32.320
If you’ve found the one you like,

00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:34.000
don’t let them slip away!

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.400
Go kiss them right now!

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:37.880
Woohoo!

00:42:58.080 --> 00:42:59.560
Prite..

00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:04.520
Can I kiss you?

00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:18.280
Huh?!

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:20.400
What the hell?

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:22.040
This isn't fun at all!

00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:46.400
Watch your step,

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:48.080
you’ll fall in the water.

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:49.080
Good.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.600
Where’s Lanee?

00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:00.000
Yeah, where did she go?

00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:23.880
What are you thinking about?

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:33.440
I don’t really like stories that end sadly.

00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:35.440
Like The Little Mermaid,

00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:37.440
she did everything for the prince,

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:40.200
but he never loved her back.

00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:43.840
That hurts, you know?

00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:48.920
Maybe..

00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:51.840
you’ve been waiting for the wrong prince.

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:56.880
I can tell Saint doesn’t like you.

00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:00.800
You can tell?

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:04.760
Someone like him doesn’t deserve you.

00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:11.520
I like you.

00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:14.920
I might not be rich like Saint,

00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:17.840
but I’d never let you out of my sight.

00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:20.000
Please go out with me.

00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:25.360
I promise I’ll never let a little mermaid like you

00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:27.360
be alone again.

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:32.360
Book?

00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:33.640
Have you seen Lanee?

00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:35.280
No idea, man.

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:43.000
Saint? Ice?

00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:45.160
Have you seen Lanee?

00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:46.400
We’re looking for her too.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.760
Why didn’t you take better care of your girlfriend?

00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:50.600
She’s drunk!

00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:52.440
If something happens, who’s gonna take responsibility?

00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:54.880
I’m sorry.

00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:58.400
Let’s go check outside the party.

00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:00.120
I’ll look around here again.

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:11.600
I think I'm going to go back...

00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:15.400
Wait.

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:17.880
Hold on, stay and talk to me.

00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:18.720
Let go.

00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:21.200
Stay still, why are you struggling?

00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:22.280
Let go.

00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:24.000
So… will you go out with me or not?

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.280
What the hell?

00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:28.000
Hey, talk to me first!

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.080
Okay?

00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:30.000
Let go.

00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:31.720
Why are you fighting me?

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:33.840
I said let go!

00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:35.080
Ow!

00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:36.320
Will you stay still or not?

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:37.280
Let go!

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:38.040
I said let go!!

00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:39.280
I said stay still!

00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:42.440
What the hell are you doing to Lanee?!

00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:46.520
Why are you so mad?

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:48.640
You messed with my boyfriend,

00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:51.200
so I messed with yours.

00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:53.600
She’s drunk!

00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:55.600
How could you take advantage of her like that?!

00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:56.600
So they’ll break up!

00:46:57.080 --> 00:47:00.000
Then Saint can finally be with you.

00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:01.280
Isn’t that a good thing?

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:02.440
What do you mean by that?

00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:05.120
Fine!

00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:07.120
Since it’s come this far.

00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:08.160
I’ll just say it straight.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000
I’m your boyfriend.

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:14.160
Has you ever cared about me?

00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:15.920
All this time, everything I’ve done for you.

00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:18.960
Has you ever noticed?

00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:20.960
You only care about him.

00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:23.640
Do you like Saint?

00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:25.720
You like him a lot, huh?

00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:28.360
You wants to fuck him so badly? Huh?

00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:31.040
Well, here you go!

00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:31.880
Well?

00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:33.600
How does it feel?

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:35.400
To have someone wanting to sleep with your girlfriend?

00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:36.640
Ow!

00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:40.000
Stop blaming me already!

00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:42.320
Every shitty thing you’ve ever done,

00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:43.680
have you ever not blamed me for it?!

00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:44.480
Have you forgotten?

00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:45.200
I'm the only one

00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:46.880
who accepts you for the shitty things you've done!

00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:47.920
It's me!

00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:48.840
I’m the only one

00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:50.720
who ever could accept all the shitty things you've done!

00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:52.720
But I’m done.

00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:55.560
Thanks for helping me before.

00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:57.560
But from now on,

00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:00.000
let’s not see each other again.

00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:02.120
We’re over.

00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:13.480
Ice.

00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:14.480
Ice!

00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:15.600
You homewrecking slut!

00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:17.120
Stop acting like you’re some kind of hero!

00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:18.000
You bastard!

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.080
What did you just say about my brother?!

00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:27.560
Damn it!

00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:34.120
Ice.

00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:35.880
I'm sorry.

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:38.480
I just want to be alone right now.

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:52.400
Saint.

00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:56.920
I’ve been listening to you for days now.

00:49:57.560 --> 00:49:59.560
You sing so beautifully.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.000
Thank you.

00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:17.240
Happy birthday to you.

00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:19.000
Happy birthday, Ice.

00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:24.760
Thank you, Warm.

00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:27.120
It’s the first birthday cake I’ve had in years.

00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:29.360
Here.

00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:31.640
I think you’ll need this.

00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:41.120
And this too.

00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:43.560
Come, let me help you put it on.

00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:49.720
Ice…

00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:52.640
I think I really like you.

00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:54.640
You’re good-looking,

00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:56.240
good in school,

00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:58.080
and you even write songs.

00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:03.120
I think we should see each other more seriously.

00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:07.680
Thank you so much.

00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:10.520
but I’m really not ready yet.

00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:12.960
You know very well

00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:14.840
what I've been through.

00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:21.080
Ice, everyone’s been through bad stuff.

00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:22.320
It’s okay.

00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:28.480
I won’t force you to do anything you don’t want.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.840
But at least...

00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:34.600
please give me a chance to take care of you.

00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:37.080
Come stay with me.

00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:01.480
(Thank you for coming into)

00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:03.240
(my life as a ray of sunshine,)

00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:08.200
(that gives meaning to a sunflower like me)

00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:13.560
(from once withered to bloom again.)

00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:18.120
(Thank you for making everyday)

00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:21.080
(no longer lonely as it once was.)

00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:25.320
(I'll give back with all the love in my heart.)

00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:30.520
(Always Red Sunflower of yours.)

00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:34.600
Whose boyfriend is this?

00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:35.960
So talented.

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:40.000
Warm.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:40.640
Yeah?

00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:42.040
I’m being serious.

00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:46.160
Why won’t you let me join the band?

00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:49.040
At least the songs I wrote.

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.000
We can sing them together.

00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:54.160
Ice.

00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:55.840
Trust me.

00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:59.080
You’re not ready to handle the crowd yet.

00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:01.760
Besides…

00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:04.440
With what happened before,

00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:07.200
it might build a wall with the crowd.

00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:15.240
Do you actually like me, or just my songs?

00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:20.320
I fell for you because of your songs.

00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:23.840
It’s the same thing, why separate them?

00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:25.280
Ice,

00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:27.160
if one day I become famous,

00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:29.280
I’ll tell everyone that

00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:32.440
my boyfriend wrote this song for me.

00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:33.800
What do you think?

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:11.400
(Saint)

00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:25.800
(I look into your eyes)

00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:29.480
(But you never show what’s on your mind)

00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:32.160
(I’ve given you my whole heart)

00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:36.640
(You just smile… and stay silent)

00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:39.080
(Have you really never known?)

00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:41.360
When will you realize

00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:43.360
how important you are to me?

00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:46.080
I’ll always be by your side

00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:48.080
as a friend,

00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:49.200
or whatever we are.

00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:50.480
(I’m growing tired, ready to give up)

00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:53.240
(Even though the two of us)

00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:56.920
(Stand so close, just within reach)

00:54:56.920 --> 00:55:00.680
(It still feels like we’re worlds apart)

00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:05.080
(I keep trying to read between the lines like this)

00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:08.760
(Oh, falling star, please tell me)

00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:11.760
(I just want to know the heart of the one I long for)

00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:14.880
(I’m ready to give you everything)

00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:19.040
(If in reality, is that you love me)

00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:22.560
(Wish for the star, just answer me)

00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:26.120
(I pray… do you like me, even a little?)

00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:28.880
(May we both find the right one)

00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:36.760
(But please… let that someone be me)

00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:51.680
This card is The Fool.

00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:53.000
A liar.

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.800
The fortune says,

00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:56.560
if you fall in love with someone,

00:55:56.560 --> 00:55:59.080
that person will be hiding a secret.

00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:00.480
I’ve got something to tell you.

00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:02.560
I’ve been secretly in love with you.

00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:07.800
Welcome to Midnight with Warm Voice.

00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:09.280
I’m here to sing this song

00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:10.800
and tell that person.

00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:12.760
Ice, please come back to me.

00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:14.400
When will you stop messing with Ice?

00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:15.440
Don’t!

00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:16.240
Fuck!

00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:19.480
I’ve been waiting for this moment for a long time, Ice.
