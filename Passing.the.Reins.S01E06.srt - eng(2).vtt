00:00:10.415 --> 00:00:11.783
UNIVERSITY STUDENT - KOZO'S SON

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:12.984
I don't need this.

00:00:13.651 --> 00:00:16.354
Please don't come and see me again.

00:00:17.255 --> 00:00:18.723
You came all this way, but…

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.925
We will never meet again.

00:00:20.992 --> 00:00:22.460
Please leave.

00:00:26.631 --> 00:00:27.565
KOZO'S SECRETARY

00:00:27.632 --> 00:00:28.633
In 2015,

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.437
Royal Hope, who narrowly
finished second in the Japan Derby,

00:00:32.504 --> 00:00:37.041
ran in the Kikuka Sho that same year,
and also in the long-awaited Arima Kinen,

00:00:37.108 --> 00:00:39.777
raising the hopes of many
horse racing fans,

00:00:39.844 --> 00:00:42.013
but was unable to secure a victory
in any of them.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.914
You did well.

00:00:44.182 --> 00:00:45.550
We'll win next time.

00:00:49.854 --> 00:00:51.623
Then, in 2016,

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:54.759
he ran in the Spring Tenno Sho,
the Takarazuka Kinen,

00:00:54.826 --> 00:00:57.996
and his second Arima Kinen,

00:00:58.062 --> 00:01:00.131
but all ended without a win.

00:01:00.198 --> 00:01:03.268
The following year, 2017,
he entered the Spring Tenno Sho,

00:01:03.334 --> 00:01:06.938
the Japan Cup, and his third Arima Kinen,

00:01:07.005 --> 00:01:09.040
all G1 races, without a win.

00:01:09.107 --> 00:01:11.442
Hope was always
one step away from victory,

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:15.346
gaining him more and more fans each year
who wished for him to win, at least once.

00:01:15.413 --> 00:01:18.049
They are all calling your name.

00:01:19.784 --> 00:01:21.319
It's a shame.

00:01:22.253 --> 00:01:24.255
We've got to come back next year.

00:01:24.989 --> 00:01:25.957
Kurisu,

00:01:26.691 --> 00:01:31.129
have you ever entered a racecourse
early in the morning?

00:01:31.863 --> 00:01:33.698
No, I have not.

00:01:34.199 --> 00:01:37.635
They once humored me and allowed me to see

00:01:38.236 --> 00:01:41.506
the Nakayama Racecourse
one winter morning.

00:01:42.674 --> 00:01:46.744
Because of the frost,
the entire turf looked frozen,

00:01:46.811 --> 00:01:51.149
and then a soft, orange light
streamed across it.

00:01:51.816 --> 00:01:57.021
The entire course then began
to glow as if it were slowly melting.

00:02:00.258 --> 00:02:02.093
When I see that view,

00:02:03.661 --> 00:02:06.197
I feel like humanity
has become more honest.

00:02:10.301 --> 00:02:12.704
When I need to have an important
conversation with someone,

00:02:13.738 --> 00:02:16.841
I'd like to take them there if I can.

00:02:20.812 --> 00:02:21.713
Understood.

00:02:24.983 --> 00:02:29.120
For your important conversations,
I'll get you a morning racecourse.

00:02:31.522 --> 00:02:32.757
I'm counting on you.

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:36.194
After next year's Arima,

00:02:37.395 --> 00:02:38.229
we'll retire.

00:02:40.865 --> 00:02:42.400
Both Hope and I…

00:02:43.468 --> 00:02:44.836
We have one year left.

00:02:49.474 --> 00:02:50.608
The Arima Kinen.

00:02:50.675 --> 00:02:53.678
A Grade I race where the horses
are selected based on fan voting

00:02:53.745 --> 00:02:55.947
and their performance that year.

00:02:56.648 --> 00:02:58.816
The horses carry
the fans' massive expectations

00:02:58.883 --> 00:03:01.286
as they run
in this glamorous year-end race.

00:03:01.786 --> 00:03:04.489
The course is 2,500 meters long
on the inner track,

00:03:04.555 --> 00:03:06.891
with many corners
and steep changes in elevation.

00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:09.360
Therefore, the outcome relies heavily on

00:03:09.427 --> 00:03:12.830
not only the horse's ability
but the entire team's race plan.

00:03:12.897 --> 00:03:16.367
IMAGINE DRAGON

00:03:17.068 --> 00:03:17.902
What?

00:03:18.436 --> 00:03:21.205
I will step down as Chairman.

00:03:22.774 --> 00:03:24.075
The rest is up to you.

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:27.912
Yutaro, you're the new president.

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:30.915
ROYAL HUMAN HR DIRECTOR

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.385
What are you planning?

00:03:36.854 --> 00:03:42.160
You wanted me to step down so badly,
but now that I am, you're sad about it?

00:03:44.562 --> 00:03:46.431
Just promise me this.

00:03:48.066 --> 00:03:49.467
Don't abandon people.

00:03:51.002 --> 00:03:52.670
No matter what happens,

00:03:54.172 --> 00:03:58.042
please protect our employees.

00:04:00.678 --> 00:04:02.046
I'll do all I can.

00:04:04.182 --> 00:04:05.283
And also,

00:04:06.651 --> 00:04:08.920
the Horse Racing Division you all despise…

00:04:11.856 --> 00:04:15.993
I'll set up a new company
and manage the horses there.

00:04:17.128 --> 00:04:18.396
I'll do it by myself.

00:04:19.464 --> 00:04:20.932
I won't buy new horses either.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.935
No more complaints, right?

00:04:25.103 --> 00:04:26.471
And one more thing.

00:04:31.175 --> 00:04:34.846
You look like a man
who's been left completely speechless.

00:04:36.781 --> 00:04:38.316
No response.

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.620
You're probably thinking,
"I should have quit sooner."

00:04:47.825 --> 00:04:51.963
Hey, when your boss tells a joke,
you're supposed to laugh.

00:04:53.731 --> 00:04:54.966
Sorry, sir.

00:04:56.167 --> 00:04:58.169
It didn't sound like a joke to me.

00:05:02.273 --> 00:05:04.075
All that's left to handle is him.

00:05:04.976 --> 00:05:06.277
You mean Koichi?

00:05:07.912 --> 00:05:09.747
Are you still in touch with him?

00:05:11.082 --> 00:05:15.086
For the past two years,
I've sent him seasonal greetings,

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.955
but he has not had a change of heart.

00:05:18.956 --> 00:05:20.491
Here's your crab.

00:05:21.826 --> 00:05:24.162
Excuse me.

00:05:26.764 --> 00:05:30.134
Even so, I'll make sure he accepts my aid.

00:05:33.037 --> 00:05:34.138
For that,

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:37.508
Hope has to earn more prize money too.

00:05:43.548 --> 00:05:45.383
Why are you retiring, President?

00:05:47.518 --> 00:05:50.188
I still can't accept it.

00:05:52.223 --> 00:05:54.292
I can understand Hope's retirement.

00:05:55.059 --> 00:05:58.796
No, I think even Hope can still race more.

00:06:00.565 --> 00:06:02.667
Even if Hope retires,

00:06:03.501 --> 00:06:06.737
don't you have the obligation
of furthering his bloodline?

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:09.740
Please.

00:06:10.441 --> 00:06:12.076
Give me a convincing reason.

00:06:17.748 --> 00:06:18.983
I have cancer.

00:06:20.318 --> 00:06:22.253
They don't know how long I have.

00:06:22.887 --> 00:06:24.889
Right now, only my family knows.

00:06:27.291 --> 00:06:31.229
I'll tell everyone when I feel it's time.

00:06:43.541 --> 00:06:44.742
Accounting…

00:06:44.809 --> 00:06:47.111
After the Horse Racing Division
goes independent,

00:06:47.178 --> 00:06:49.680
I hope you'll stay
in the Accounting Division.

00:06:50.648 --> 00:06:51.549
Well…

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:55.219
We should talk about his illness first.

00:06:55.753 --> 00:07:00.391
He ran amok all over the place,
and now he just announces this.

00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.828
I wish he would consider how I feel too.

00:07:04.328 --> 00:07:05.363
Good grief.

00:07:10.668 --> 00:07:14.772
Keeping you in the company
is my father's wish.

00:07:16.407 --> 00:07:17.875
And one more thing,

00:07:18.442 --> 00:07:20.511
let Kurisu stay with the company.

00:07:21.078 --> 00:07:24.982
I can't drag him into this any further.

00:07:26.951 --> 00:07:29.186
Please consider this offer.

00:07:32.356 --> 00:07:34.058
FIGHT - IZANA

00:07:42.667 --> 00:07:43.768
Excuse me.

00:07:43.834 --> 00:07:44.902
What is it?

00:07:45.536 --> 00:07:47.138
I've come to help.

00:07:48.873 --> 00:07:51.075
There's nothing for you to help with.

00:07:55.646 --> 00:07:57.448
I heard from Yutaro.

00:07:58.215 --> 00:08:00.184
You even worried about my employment.

00:08:00.251 --> 00:08:01.285
Thank you very much.

00:08:02.353 --> 00:08:04.455
I told him not to say anything!

00:08:07.158 --> 00:08:10.728
Be honest. You wanted to work
for the Accounting Division, right?

00:08:10.795 --> 00:08:12.930
Aren't you glad your wish came true?

00:08:13.698 --> 00:08:14.832
I must refuse.

00:08:15.333 --> 00:08:17.702
I am a member
of the Horse Racing Division.

00:08:17.768 --> 00:08:19.837
It's going to disappear, you know.

00:08:19.904 --> 00:08:21.739
You'll be fired.

00:08:21.806 --> 00:08:25.776
-Just move to Accounting, okay?
-I'm afraid I cannot betray you.

00:08:25.843 --> 00:08:29.547
-I made you that promise.
-I'm telling you that I don't need you.

00:08:30.114 --> 00:08:31.649
It wouldn't be a betrayal.

00:08:31.716 --> 00:08:34.318
But what about my dream?

00:08:36.087 --> 00:08:40.157
The dream of winning
the Arima Kinen with you, President.

00:08:45.997 --> 00:08:47.231
Are you planning to…

00:08:48.466 --> 00:08:51.902
succumb before the Arima Kinen?

00:08:53.337 --> 00:08:55.940
Do you have so little faith in yourself?

00:08:56.007 --> 00:08:56.874
What?

00:08:56.941 --> 00:08:59.543
If the owner is so weak-willed,

00:09:00.311 --> 00:09:02.747
I feel pity for the horse that has to run.

00:09:03.347 --> 00:09:04.281
I've decided.

00:09:04.815 --> 00:09:07.385
I will absolutely not quit
being your secretary.

00:09:09.286 --> 00:09:11.288
If you want to fire me,

00:09:11.822 --> 00:09:14.425
please wait until
after the next Arima Kinen.

00:09:15.026 --> 00:09:18.629
That's the responsibility
of a man who talks about dreams!

00:09:21.932 --> 00:09:23.067
So insolent.

00:09:27.271 --> 00:09:29.640
I bet there will be
a generation change this year.

00:09:29.707 --> 00:09:31.742
I think Valshare still has it.

00:09:31.809 --> 00:09:34.879
-Well, that one's a separate case.
-What about Royal Hope?

00:09:34.945 --> 00:09:38.482
Hope just can't win G1 races.
It's probably impossible now.

00:09:39.717 --> 00:09:41.619
-Nakajo.
-What?

00:09:41.686 --> 00:09:43.487
Someone is looking at us.

00:09:43.554 --> 00:09:44.488
Where?

00:09:44.555 --> 00:09:46.023
Do you know him?

00:09:54.765 --> 00:09:55.933
I've told you many times.

00:09:56.701 --> 00:09:58.035
I don't need any aid.

00:09:59.203 --> 00:10:01.272
I have the savings my mother left me,

00:10:01.906 --> 00:10:04.175
I can manage until graduation.

00:10:04.742 --> 00:10:06.277
Then at least, your father…

00:10:08.546 --> 00:10:12.750
I mean, our company's Kozo Sanno…
Can you meet and talk--

00:10:12.817 --> 00:10:14.518
Talk about what?

00:10:18.355 --> 00:10:20.157
There's nothing to talk about.

00:10:22.827 --> 00:10:24.095
How about horse talk?

00:10:26.831 --> 00:10:28.232
Talk about Royal Hope.

00:10:28.866 --> 00:10:32.069
You're in the Horse Racing Research Club.
Perhaps you can give us some ideas.

00:10:32.136 --> 00:10:33.204
Did my mother tell you?

00:10:34.472 --> 00:10:35.606
I apologize.

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:37.975
I just feel like it was meant to be.

00:10:40.077 --> 00:10:42.880
You mean, like father, like son?

00:10:44.081 --> 00:10:46.383
Quit it with your fantasies.

00:10:48.886 --> 00:10:51.388
I just like horse racing, that's all.

00:10:52.623 --> 00:10:53.624
Are we done?

00:10:54.125 --> 00:10:55.392
Excuse me.

00:11:01.532 --> 00:11:02.900
The first race of that year…

00:11:02.967 --> 00:11:04.769
Yes, I saw it!

00:11:04.835 --> 00:11:06.537
He won, didn't he? I was surprised.

00:11:06.604 --> 00:11:09.440
Royal Hope was entered
into an overseas race

00:11:09.507 --> 00:11:13.444
at Kozo Sanno's suggestion,
and brilliantly won the Dubai Gold Cup.

00:11:14.078 --> 00:11:18.182
Afterwards, in the Summer Sapporo Kinen
and the Fall Tenno Sho,

00:11:18.249 --> 00:11:20.551
he won second place.

00:11:20.618 --> 00:11:23.254
Although the dream of a G1 win
remained out of reach,

00:11:23.954 --> 00:11:27.892
he was steadily increasing
his chances of entering the Arima Kinen.

00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.361
I think you're the one in fine form.

00:11:31.028 --> 00:11:32.630
It's all about skill.

00:11:33.597 --> 00:11:34.565
The next one.

00:11:35.499 --> 00:11:36.467
All right.

00:11:39.637 --> 00:11:41.071
Is Hope doing well?

00:11:41.872 --> 00:11:46.076
Yes. As planned,
he'll run in next month's Japan Cup.

00:11:47.011 --> 00:11:50.981
At this point, he's thriving,
both mentally and physically.

00:11:52.183 --> 00:11:56.120
I knew running him in Dubai
was the right call.

00:11:57.588 --> 00:12:01.926
A change of environment
seems to wake Hope up instantly.

00:12:02.493 --> 00:12:03.861
It's the same for my son.

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:06.997
He's admirable.

00:12:07.064 --> 00:12:08.098
THE NEW LEADER'S VISION

00:12:08.165 --> 00:12:11.702
I've never done anything for him.

00:12:14.138 --> 00:12:15.172
How is Koichi?

00:12:16.507 --> 00:12:19.109
I've been contacting him every month, but…

00:12:23.647 --> 00:12:25.416
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

00:12:27.751 --> 00:12:28.953
I'll call for the nurse.

00:12:29.019 --> 00:12:30.688
No, I'm fine!

00:12:30.754 --> 00:12:31.922
Dad?

00:12:31.989 --> 00:12:33.991
Dad, are you all right?

00:12:34.959 --> 00:12:36.527
Are you okay?

00:12:36.594 --> 00:12:39.230
He's not responding well to the treatment.

00:12:41.799 --> 00:12:44.134
I've never seen him like this.

00:12:45.736 --> 00:12:46.804
I…

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.407
It's all right.

00:12:51.075 --> 00:12:53.777
He'll make it. I'm sure of it.

00:13:07.057 --> 00:13:08.792
Mr. Kurisu!

00:13:09.627 --> 00:13:10.527
Hello.

00:13:14.231 --> 00:13:16.634
He's not here today either?

00:13:20.271 --> 00:13:22.172
He's acting strong,

00:13:22.673 --> 00:13:25.876
but the treatment is draining
his stamina somewhat.

00:13:26.911 --> 00:13:28.312
Actually…

00:13:30.648 --> 00:13:34.652
The article I promised to write
about the President and Hope.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.689
I stopped writing it
after last year's Arima.

00:13:40.391 --> 00:13:45.162
I believe the only thing missing,
the one thing…

00:13:48.032 --> 00:13:50.334
is the moment he wins Arima.

00:13:53.203 --> 00:13:54.271
Mr. Kurisu.

00:13:55.039 --> 00:13:57.341
He'll make it to the goal, right?

00:13:59.243 --> 00:14:00.244
Yes.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.682
Come on, Mr. Taira…

00:14:05.282 --> 00:14:06.850
SORYU CO. CEO

00:14:06.917 --> 00:14:08.485
SHIINA'S SECRETARY

00:14:09.053 --> 00:14:11.588
I've decided to retire Valshare
and Imagine Dragon

00:14:11.655 --> 00:14:13.023
at the end of this year.

00:14:14.058 --> 00:14:16.860
But they are
the two strongest horses this year!

00:14:17.361 --> 00:14:18.762
Both can still run.

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:22.132
They have the power to create history!

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:26.203
They'll keep contributing as stud horses.

00:14:26.704 --> 00:14:29.139
I want to meet him
at this year's Arima Kinen.

00:14:29.907 --> 00:14:32.643
Please tell your boss that.

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:45.322
In the final stretch,
Imagine Dragon is in the lead,

00:14:45.389 --> 00:14:47.291
with a three-length, four-length lead.

00:14:47.358 --> 00:14:49.727
The lead isn't shrinking.
The pace isn't slowing.

00:14:49.793 --> 00:14:53.564
Imagine Dragon, after a perfect race,
crosses the finish line first!

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:56.667
In first place, Imagine Dragon.
In second place, Royal Hope.

00:14:56.734 --> 00:14:58.836
Hope also missed the win here,

00:14:59.403 --> 00:15:02.006
but he secured second place
in the Japan Cup,

00:15:02.072 --> 00:15:06.310
which all but guaranteed
his fourth entry into the Arima Kinen.

00:15:06.377 --> 00:15:07.244
Hey!

00:15:07.945 --> 00:15:10.214
-President!
-Have a seat.

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:12.216
-President!
-Hey there.

00:15:12.282 --> 00:15:18.055
I've realized that I love horses,
but I love the racecourse too.

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:23.694
That massive, jostling crowd,
the great roar like an earthquake…

00:15:24.261 --> 00:15:26.130
That's what makes horse racing.

00:15:26.196 --> 00:15:27.498
Sit down.

00:15:28.065 --> 00:15:30.567
If I were just watching from afar,

00:15:31.201 --> 00:15:33.704
I probably wouldn't have gotten
this absorbed in it.

00:15:33.771 --> 00:15:35.773
Then please see the Arima in person, sir.

00:15:35.839 --> 00:15:37.307
He's not in yet.

00:15:37.374 --> 00:15:38.742
It's basically a given.

00:15:38.809 --> 00:15:40.677
Everyone loves him.

00:15:41.311 --> 00:15:43.547
-You mean my dad?
-No, Hope.

00:15:44.248 --> 00:15:46.050
I mean, the President is…

00:15:46.116 --> 00:15:47.684
Don't trip me up like that!

00:15:48.986 --> 00:15:51.622
Well, for now, should we have a toast?

00:15:51.688 --> 00:15:55.059
-Who put you in charge?
-Because no one else was going to!

00:15:55.125 --> 00:15:56.193
You can drink today.

00:16:09.173 --> 00:16:10.541
We'll win the Arima.

00:16:11.408 --> 00:16:14.745
Then Hope will retire.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.114
I'll quit too.

00:16:18.782 --> 00:16:20.284
I'm sorry.

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:23.420
I was agonizing over when to tell you all.

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:27.858
And the moment ended up being now.

00:16:29.693 --> 00:16:33.464
Thank you so much
for bringing Hope this far.

00:16:35.032 --> 00:16:36.700
I'm glad I could tell you directly.

00:16:41.238 --> 00:16:42.706
It's you, President.

00:16:44.208 --> 00:16:47.111
The man who brought us this far is you.

00:16:48.745 --> 00:16:51.748
If you hadn't believed in us back then,

00:16:51.815 --> 00:16:54.618
I don't think Hope
would have been able to run this far.

00:16:55.853 --> 00:16:56.887
That's certainly true.

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:04.161
Kanako.

00:17:05.262 --> 00:17:07.831
I'm truly glad you were here.

00:17:09.633 --> 00:17:10.501
Hironaka,

00:17:11.702 --> 00:17:14.004
Sumire, Daichi,

00:17:15.672 --> 00:17:17.307
Grandpa Nozaki,

00:17:18.142 --> 00:17:19.143
Ryujiro,

00:17:20.644 --> 00:17:21.979
and you, Reporter.

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:26.016
Everyone, thank you.

00:17:28.619 --> 00:17:32.990
Oh, actually,
Shohei also wanted to join us,

00:17:33.924 --> 00:17:35.626
but he had school today.

00:17:35.692 --> 00:17:37.461
Shohei, it's the President.

00:17:38.195 --> 00:17:39.329
Good evening.

00:17:40.164 --> 00:17:42.166
How is the Horseracing School?

00:17:42.933 --> 00:17:45.669
Well, it's so-so.

00:17:46.904 --> 00:17:51.275
I'll definitely go to see the Arima,
so please do your best, everyone.

00:17:52.743 --> 00:17:54.611
He's so well-mannered now.

00:17:54.678 --> 00:17:57.347
Stop! It'll go to his head!

00:17:58.115 --> 00:18:00.150
See you, Shohei. Keep up the good work.

00:18:00.217 --> 00:18:01.518
Excuse me.

00:18:05.289 --> 00:18:08.659
What we need to do is the same as before.

00:18:09.893 --> 00:18:13.297
All of us will bring
Royal Hope to victory.

00:18:14.665 --> 00:18:16.900
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

00:19:15.192 --> 00:19:16.360
If…

00:19:19.663 --> 00:19:20.931
It's just an "if."

00:19:22.132 --> 00:19:25.235
If Hope wins the Arima Kinen…

00:19:30.907 --> 00:19:32.376
will you marry me?

00:19:35.379 --> 00:19:37.080
The President is retiring,

00:19:37.648 --> 00:19:41.051
and now I'm in a position
where I can't see the future at all,

00:19:41.885 --> 00:19:44.655
but precisely because of that,
I think I can do anything,

00:19:44.721 --> 00:19:46.757
and create any future.

00:19:52.129 --> 00:19:53.196
I'm serious.

00:19:54.965 --> 00:19:58.335
I want to marry you.

00:20:06.677 --> 00:20:07.711
No, I don't want that.

00:20:07.778 --> 00:20:10.947
-What? You don't want to?
-Of course not.

00:20:11.682 --> 00:20:14.351
What the heck?
Did you think I would say yes to that?

00:20:14.418 --> 00:20:16.520
Well… Sorry?

00:20:16.586 --> 00:20:18.955
My whole life has been dictated by horses.

00:20:19.022 --> 00:20:21.091
Since childhood, it's all been horses.

00:20:21.692 --> 00:20:24.528
Even my only son
was taken by horses, and now what?

00:20:25.128 --> 00:20:28.865
You want to gamble my happiness
on the result of a horse race? No!

00:20:28.932 --> 00:20:31.335
Let me decide my own life.

00:20:32.436 --> 00:20:33.503
I see.

00:20:34.071 --> 00:20:35.806
That's true.

00:20:35.872 --> 00:20:36.807
So…

00:20:37.808 --> 00:20:39.343
This has nothing to do with Hope.

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:42.746
I'll decide everything.
Including marriage.

00:20:44.481 --> 00:20:45.515
Meaning?

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:47.951
Meaning…

00:20:51.521 --> 00:20:53.590
-I won't marry you.
-You won't?

00:20:53.657 --> 00:20:54.591
Not right now.

00:20:54.658 --> 00:20:57.427
For now, I don't want to take you away.

00:20:59.029 --> 00:21:00.764
Don't be distracted by love.

00:21:00.831 --> 00:21:03.333
Focus on staying
with the President until the end.

00:21:05.569 --> 00:21:06.670
I can wait

00:21:07.637 --> 00:21:10.640
ten years or even twenty.

00:21:15.245 --> 00:21:16.380
Thank you.

00:21:19.783 --> 00:21:22.619
All right, let's write one of those.

00:21:22.686 --> 00:21:23.553
Sure.

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:25.856
KOZO SANNO'S RECOVERY
VICTORY AT ARIMA

00:21:25.922 --> 00:21:27.157
Okay.

00:21:29.259 --> 00:21:30.093
Seriously?

00:21:30.961 --> 00:21:31.895
What?

00:21:32.529 --> 00:21:34.898
TO LIVE HAPPILY WITH EIJI

00:21:36.333 --> 00:21:38.869
I'm not sure things
will work out between us.

00:21:38.935 --> 00:21:42.072
-Come on. Both are correct!
-Right.

00:21:42.806 --> 00:21:45.342
-Please let me marry Yuriko.
-What?

00:21:46.076 --> 00:21:46.910
What is it?

00:21:47.477 --> 00:21:48.645
Nothing. Pardon me.

00:21:50.213 --> 00:21:51.248
Please.

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:57.554
Young folks never fail to surprise me.

00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:01.625
What do you say, Dad?

00:22:05.662 --> 00:22:07.864
If I win the Arima,
please let us get married.

00:22:08.632 --> 00:22:09.800
-Sorry.
-What's up with you?

00:22:09.866 --> 00:22:10.700
My apologies.

00:22:13.904 --> 00:22:15.272
Did you ask her?

00:22:16.106 --> 00:22:17.274
Do you mean Mom?

00:22:18.442 --> 00:22:19.476
I'll ask her later.

00:22:20.944 --> 00:22:22.012
I'll tell you now.

00:22:22.813 --> 00:22:26.516
Some people hate horses, you know.

00:22:28.285 --> 00:22:29.186
Really?

00:22:29.686 --> 00:22:30.554
Yeah.

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:33.223
Make sure to get results.

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:34.391
It will be fine.

00:22:34.458 --> 00:22:36.026
Mom just hates horses,

00:22:36.092 --> 00:22:38.562
but otherwise,
she's a very sensible person.

00:22:39.496 --> 00:22:41.731
Wait. That sounds
the least advantageous to me.

00:22:44.134 --> 00:22:47.370
It's fine. You relax too.

00:22:48.405 --> 00:22:49.473
I'm okay.

00:22:51.908 --> 00:22:53.877
I thought he'd be against it.

00:22:54.544 --> 00:22:55.946
That was easy.

00:22:57.614 --> 00:22:59.749
But he remembers promises.

00:22:59.816 --> 00:23:02.018
So if you don't win,
who knows what will happen.

00:23:02.719 --> 00:23:03.553
Right.

00:23:16.967 --> 00:23:18.101
Wait. Really?

00:23:18.168 --> 00:23:20.437
Oh, this year's Arima
is going to be amazing.

00:23:20.504 --> 00:23:21.705
-I know.
-Right.

00:23:21.771 --> 00:23:24.774
-Should we go see this one?
-It's their last.

00:23:24.841 --> 00:23:27.010
I'm not sure…

00:23:27.777 --> 00:23:30.046
I apologize for calling you here.

00:23:31.114 --> 00:23:33.283
Hope is retiring, isn't he?

00:23:34.117 --> 00:23:35.085
Yes.

00:23:35.952 --> 00:23:38.822
Thanks to that, he's even featured
in the sports newspapers.

00:23:38.889 --> 00:23:40.023
That's a pity.

00:23:41.892 --> 00:23:46.162
I thought Hope was a horse
that genuinely loved to run.

00:23:48.398 --> 00:23:49.399
I knew it.

00:23:49.933 --> 00:23:51.301
You truly understand.

00:23:51.368 --> 00:23:53.036
No, stop that kind of talk.

00:23:54.704 --> 00:23:57.007
You keep trying to pull me
into your world.

00:23:57.974 --> 00:23:58.942
I apologize.

00:23:59.442 --> 00:24:00.710
Thank you for waiting.

00:24:05.115 --> 00:24:06.082
Enjoy.

00:24:10.887 --> 00:24:13.490
So? What is this about?

00:24:15.959 --> 00:24:17.794
It's about the President's health.

00:24:19.429 --> 00:24:24.901
Given his age,
his doctor says remission is unlikely.

00:24:25.402 --> 00:24:26.670
Along with Hope,

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:28.972
the President will also retire.

00:24:31.007 --> 00:24:32.275
Please.

00:24:32.342 --> 00:24:34.678
Could you possibly meet
with the President?

00:24:36.947 --> 00:24:40.984
I will prepare
a special place for the two of you.

00:24:42.953 --> 00:24:45.255
-Nakayama in the morning?
-Yes.

00:24:45.789 --> 00:24:47.991
I begged the staff,

00:24:48.058 --> 00:24:51.761
and they agreed to open it
two days before the Arima.

00:24:52.629 --> 00:24:56.232
So I'll have Koichi join you at 6:00 a.m.

00:24:56.299 --> 00:25:00.070
Before 7:00 a.m., the two of you
can watch the sunrise from the course.

00:25:00.737 --> 00:25:04.074
You are a man who goes to extremes.

00:25:04.874 --> 00:25:07.444
All thanks to your guidance, President.

00:25:09.746 --> 00:25:13.083
But, Kurisu, I am like this now.

00:25:13.783 --> 00:25:15.318
What could I say to him?

00:25:16.319 --> 00:25:19.089
What can I do for him right now?

00:25:21.658 --> 00:25:23.960
Just meet him.

00:25:25.562 --> 00:25:29.432
Meet him and watch the sunrise together.

00:25:29.499 --> 00:25:30.467
Isn't that enough?

00:25:31.368 --> 00:25:32.802
As for what comes after,

00:25:33.937 --> 00:25:36.039
I believe Koichi can decide that.

00:25:38.274 --> 00:25:42.646
President, congratulations
on the confirmed entry!

00:25:42.712 --> 00:25:44.748
Congratulations!

00:25:44.814 --> 00:25:49.019
Hope, who has yet to win a G1,
should get a grand send-off.

00:25:49.586 --> 00:25:53.456
This desire from the fans
made his Arima Kinen entry possible.

00:25:53.523 --> 00:25:55.992
He can tell!

00:25:56.059 --> 00:25:58.862
-You know, don't you? Hope!
-Can you see him, President?

00:25:58.928 --> 00:26:00.463
Hey, Hope. Smile.

00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:01.831
Hey, smile.

00:26:04.034 --> 00:26:06.369
He might be in his best form now.

00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:10.373
He's calm. He's matured.

00:26:11.007 --> 00:26:14.044
He probably realizes it too.
That this is the last.

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:18.815
This will be his fourth Arima Kinen.
Are there any differences this time?

00:26:18.882 --> 00:26:21.384
Winning the Arima Kinen is the owner's…

00:26:21.985 --> 00:26:23.086
Our dream.

00:26:24.187 --> 00:26:26.489
We want Hope to retire with a win.

00:26:27.123 --> 00:26:28.058
That's all.

00:26:36.266 --> 00:26:39.235
-Mr. Kurisu.
-How is the President?

00:26:39.302 --> 00:26:41.037
He was in pain all of a sudden,

00:26:41.571 --> 00:26:44.174
lost consciousness,
and is now in the treatment room.

00:26:53.283 --> 00:26:54.217
Madam.

00:26:54.284 --> 00:26:55.385
Madam.

00:26:57.454 --> 00:26:58.988
Are you all right by yourself?

00:26:59.522 --> 00:27:01.725
Yes, I'm fine.

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:05.428
When's the next race?

00:27:06.596 --> 00:27:08.531
The Arima Kinen is two days from now.

00:27:10.734 --> 00:27:12.635
He often used to say…

00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:18.174
that winning the Arima Kinen
would be the best feeling.

00:27:19.375 --> 00:27:23.980
At the end of his life, he wants to win
and then wrap it all up.

00:27:27.751 --> 00:27:31.387
Yes. But life doesn't always go to plan.

00:27:38.895 --> 00:27:42.298
NAKAYAMA RACECOURSE

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.235
Please.

00:27:45.301 --> 00:27:47.704
Could you possibly meet
with the President?

00:28:02.619 --> 00:28:05.655
Sorry. I'm here by myself.

00:28:14.764 --> 00:28:16.900
Could you walk along the outside boundary?

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.569
We don't want to damage the inside turf.

00:28:20.136 --> 00:28:21.070
Sure.

00:28:32.248 --> 00:28:36.986
Today's sunrise will be before 7:00 a.m.

00:28:37.053 --> 00:28:37.954
Yes.

00:28:39.122 --> 00:28:42.759
They once allowed me to see
the Nakayama Racecourse

00:28:42.826 --> 00:28:44.594
on a winter morning.

00:28:58.608 --> 00:29:01.711
Because of the frost,
the entire turf looked frozen,

00:29:02.345 --> 00:29:05.982
and then a soft, orange light
streamed across it.

00:29:06.049 --> 00:29:10.453
The entire course then began
to glow as if it were slowly melting.

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:52.028
It'd be nice if he won.

00:29:52.695 --> 00:29:53.997
Royal Hope, I mean.

00:29:55.398 --> 00:29:56.566
What?

00:29:56.633 --> 00:29:59.269
You see, I'm a fan.

00:30:01.337 --> 00:30:03.940
An employee of JRA
shouldn't be saying this,

00:30:04.607 --> 00:30:07.377
so I'm just talking to myself.

00:30:07.944 --> 00:30:10.480
That horse's competitive spirit…

00:30:11.114 --> 00:30:12.615
My gosh.

00:30:12.682 --> 00:30:14.083
I love it.

00:30:15.251 --> 00:30:16.786
The last race.

00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:19.322
I have high hopes for him.

00:30:20.723 --> 00:30:21.624
Yes.

00:30:22.558 --> 00:30:23.793
Thank you.

00:30:57.527 --> 00:30:58.728
It's the final adjustments.

00:30:59.462 --> 00:31:01.898
Take your time and enjoy this.

00:31:02.465 --> 00:31:03.366
Yes!

00:31:44.807 --> 00:31:47.410
IMAGINE DRAGON, VALSHARE, ROYAL HOPE
A GLORIOUS LAST RUN

00:31:49.112 --> 00:31:50.747
The forecast says it'll rain.

00:31:54.817 --> 00:31:56.319
A race in the rain, huh?

00:32:03.426 --> 00:32:06.496
What is Shohei even doing?

00:32:06.562 --> 00:32:08.531
-Oh, Shohei!
-'Sup!

00:32:09.098 --> 00:32:11.834
Wow! You look all grown up!

00:32:11.901 --> 00:32:14.937
-You haven't caught a cold, have you?
-Shut up, Mom.

00:32:15.004 --> 00:32:17.407
Good. We can watch it all together.

00:32:18.574 --> 00:32:21.077
Do you want to go to the paddock too?
To see Ryujiro?

00:32:21.144 --> 00:32:22.445
I'll pass.

00:32:23.346 --> 00:32:25.048
He's not my idol anymore.

00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:27.016
He's my rival.

00:32:27.583 --> 00:32:29.519
Well said.

00:32:33.056 --> 00:32:34.424
That's unfortunate.

00:32:35.091 --> 00:32:38.261
I wanted to see their last race
along with him.

00:32:40.363 --> 00:32:43.066
May I ask you one thing?

00:32:44.767 --> 00:32:45.768
What is it?

00:32:46.536 --> 00:32:50.006
Why do you still respect
our President so much?

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:52.442
I've always wondered.

00:32:54.911 --> 00:32:56.979
It's because he carries a lot
on his shoulders.

00:32:57.613 --> 00:33:01.584
I like people who take on
the dreams of many others.

00:33:02.085 --> 00:33:03.519
People like that are rare.

00:33:04.253 --> 00:33:06.656
Also, he always seemed to be
enjoying himself.

00:33:06.722 --> 00:33:07.857
I apologize.

00:33:07.924 --> 00:33:11.561
My horse is running, you see,
and I want to watch it on the big screen.

00:33:11.627 --> 00:33:15.998
Seeing someone truly enjoying
something makes me happy as well.

00:33:16.499 --> 00:33:17.767
I respect that person.

00:33:19.068 --> 00:33:20.236
When I talk to him,

00:33:21.337 --> 00:33:23.406
I feel like it soothes my loneliness.

00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:29.278
Let's have a race without regrets.

00:33:30.279 --> 00:33:31.214
Yes.

00:33:37.086 --> 00:33:38.221
Definitely.

00:33:45.895 --> 00:33:47.063
BECOME A LEGEND, ROYAL HOPE

00:33:48.231 --> 00:33:49.298
Any orders?

00:33:50.133 --> 00:33:51.901
The President had only one order.

00:33:52.668 --> 00:33:54.103
"Win."

00:33:56.172 --> 00:33:57.206
Roger that.

00:33:59.942 --> 00:34:00.910
Good luck.

00:34:03.446 --> 00:34:04.614
I'll do my best.

00:34:07.984 --> 00:34:09.218
Everyone.

00:34:11.187 --> 00:34:14.357
Thank you so much for everything.

00:34:17.593 --> 00:34:18.761
Until the very end,

00:34:19.962 --> 00:34:22.331
please keep supporting us.

00:34:25.401 --> 00:34:27.937
Stop!

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:39.015
Hope.

00:34:40.683 --> 00:34:41.551
Let's do this.

00:34:42.084 --> 00:34:43.452
-Okay, let's go.
-Yes.

00:34:51.093 --> 00:34:52.295
All right!

00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:01.504
Thank you for bringing me this far.

00:35:02.004 --> 00:35:05.908
If I hadn't met you, President,
I wouldn't have become a manager.

00:35:06.742 --> 00:35:09.979
And I'll never be a manager
under anyone else but you.

00:35:11.214 --> 00:35:12.248
Therefore,

00:35:13.115 --> 00:35:17.019
along with you,
I'll also step away from this world.

00:35:17.687 --> 00:35:20.423
Thank you for all this time.

00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:22.558
The last run.

00:35:22.625 --> 00:35:24.126
Let's all pray together.

00:35:35.871 --> 00:35:36.839
Over here!

00:35:45.748 --> 00:35:48.117
The horses for the eighth day

00:35:48.184 --> 00:35:51.087
of the Fifth Nakayama Race,
the 63rd Arima Kinen…

00:35:51.153 --> 00:35:52.321
Dad!

00:35:53.256 --> 00:35:56.626
-Yuriko, it's starting.
-Hold on a minute.

00:35:56.692 --> 00:35:58.294
426 kg.

00:36:00.796 --> 00:36:06.235
NAKAYAMA RACECOURSE

00:36:09.438 --> 00:36:11.173
TO KOICHI NAKAJO

00:36:13.809 --> 00:36:17.813
2018 ARIMA KINEN
SPECIAL TICKET

00:36:50.212 --> 00:36:51.580
NAKAYAMA RACECOURSE

00:37:00.289 --> 00:37:02.892
ARIMA KINEN

00:37:06.162 --> 00:37:07.963
You can do it!

00:37:19.875 --> 00:37:22.411
Is the rain that's starting to fall
a farewell rain,

00:37:22.478 --> 00:37:24.246
mourning the great horses
who are retiring?

00:37:24.313 --> 00:37:28.084
Or is it a divine prank,
imposing an ordeal on their final race?

00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:30.753
Nakayama Racecourse, turf, 2,500 meters.

00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:33.456
The odd-numbered horses
have settled into the gates,

00:37:33.522 --> 00:37:36.959
and the even-numbered horses
are steadily heading toward them.

00:37:37.526 --> 00:37:41.197
Will victory smile upon
fan-favorite Royal Hope?

00:37:41.263 --> 00:37:44.333
Japan Cup winner Imagine Dragon?

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:47.937
Or the Derby horse, Valshare? The dreams
of all racing fans are gathered…

00:37:48.003 --> 00:37:49.205
Hope.

00:37:49.271 --> 00:37:51.273
…here at the Nakayama Racecourse!

00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:54.710
Finally, Number 16, Valshare,
enters the gate.

00:37:55.945 --> 00:37:56.846
Hope.

00:37:58.147 --> 00:37:59.648
The boss is watching.

00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:03.786
It's 2018, the final Arima Kinen
of the Heisei era.

00:38:03.853 --> 00:38:08.457
Which horse will close out
this chaotic year and usher in a new era?

00:38:10.593 --> 00:38:13.195
It's the 63rd Grand Prix Arima Kinen,
and they are off!

00:38:13.262 --> 00:38:16.098
Taking the lead first is Royal Hope!

00:38:16.165 --> 00:38:17.400
Royal Hope is the leader!

00:38:17.466 --> 00:38:19.535
-Did he get carried away?
-What?

00:38:19.602 --> 00:38:21.771
-Did they mess up?
-Or is this Ryujiro Saki's strategy?

00:38:21.837 --> 00:38:23.506
-The leader is Royal Hope.
-Hope…

00:38:23.572 --> 00:38:25.207
Following him are Number six,
South Knight,

00:38:25.274 --> 00:38:26.642
and Number Nine, Horai Estate.

00:38:26.709 --> 00:38:28.310
In fourth is Number 16, Valshare.

00:38:28.377 --> 00:38:30.813
In the middle is Number Four,
Imagine Dragon.

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:32.314
They are between corners.

00:38:32.381 --> 00:38:35.351
-Two lengths behind is Number 12, Arti.
-Hope won't keep this up.

00:38:35.418 --> 00:38:38.387
Another three lengths back
is Number Two, Michael Columbia.

00:38:43.092 --> 00:38:44.593
Third from last is Number 11…

00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:46.862
Go. Do your best.

00:38:46.929 --> 00:38:49.498
Number 14, Love Panther is running last.

00:38:49.565 --> 00:38:51.066
They passed the winning post.

00:38:51.133 --> 00:38:54.203
Number 15, Royal Hope,
pulling away from the inside rail,

00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:56.071
maintains a five-length lead.

00:38:56.138 --> 00:38:58.274
The first 1,000 meters
were run at a fast pace…

00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:00.309
He won't last till the end like this.

00:39:00.376 --> 00:39:04.079
Number 13, Binan, Number 16, Valshare,
are approaching the first corner.

00:39:04.146 --> 00:39:05.581
Royal Hope is in the lead.

00:39:05.648 --> 00:39:09.452
From the first to the second corner,
they have formed a long line!

00:39:11.153 --> 00:39:12.555
It's your debut too.

00:39:12.621 --> 00:39:13.889
I'm also trying again.

00:39:13.956 --> 00:39:16.158
Shall we run together?

00:39:16.225 --> 00:39:19.895
But I'm captivated by
Hope's true strength.

00:39:19.962 --> 00:39:21.931
In his refusal to yield,

00:39:21.997 --> 00:39:24.300
I feel a power and fighting spirit.

00:39:29.104 --> 00:39:30.639
Do you have the will to win?

00:39:30.706 --> 00:39:31.874
It's all I want.

00:39:31.941 --> 00:39:33.776
Then please, I beg you!

00:39:33.843 --> 00:39:35.077
My father's dream

00:39:35.144 --> 00:39:38.948
is the dream of everyone in Hidaka.

00:39:40.483 --> 00:39:42.084
See you, Hope.

00:39:42.151 --> 00:39:43.786
Do your best!

00:39:44.386 --> 00:39:46.055
Do your best!

00:39:46.121 --> 00:39:47.556
Do your best!

00:39:47.623 --> 00:39:49.558
ROYAL HOPE

00:39:49.625 --> 00:39:53.462
Now, Number 16, Valshare,
passes Number 13, Binan into second place.

00:39:53.529 --> 00:39:55.698
-Yes! Go!
-The gap is three to four lengths.

00:39:55.764 --> 00:39:59.235
The leader is nearing
the halfway point of the backstretch.

00:39:59.301 --> 00:40:03.806
The three horses about to retire after
this Arima dash down the backstretch.

00:40:03.873 --> 00:40:05.574
Number 13, Binan, is in third.

00:40:05.641 --> 00:40:10.112
Behind him is Number Two, Michael
Columbia, by a gap of nearly ten lengths.

00:40:10.179 --> 00:40:12.781
Now, all the horses
are starting to increase their pace!

00:40:12.848 --> 00:40:14.884
The leader is still Number 15, Royal Hope.

00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:18.621
Number 16, Valshare, in second,
is closing the gap furiously!

00:40:18.687 --> 00:40:21.891
Between the third and fourth corners,
Valshare is alongside Royal Hope!

00:40:21.957 --> 00:40:26.362
And now, Number Four, Imagine Dragon,
is moving up from the middle of the pack!

00:40:26.428 --> 00:40:28.631
-Hope! Dad!
-Royal Hope and Valshare.

00:40:28.697 --> 00:40:30.833
The two rivals from the Derby
are side-by-side!

00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:32.701
Now, the Nakayama straight is short!

00:40:32.768 --> 00:40:34.904
Imagine Dragon
is coming up on the far outside!

00:40:34.970 --> 00:40:37.540
A three-way battle
of the top horses this year!

00:40:38.774 --> 00:40:39.975
Want to come over to my place?

00:40:43.279 --> 00:40:45.881
They are not giving an inch!
Royal Hope won't yield!

00:40:47.082 --> 00:40:49.585
-We did it!
-It's just one win!

00:40:49.652 --> 00:40:51.020
Now, Valshare has taken the lead!

00:40:51.086 --> 00:40:53.856
From the outside, Imagine Dragon!
Has Royal Hope run out of steam?

00:40:53.923 --> 00:40:55.157
Promise me one thing.

00:40:55.224 --> 00:40:56.892
You must never betray me.

00:40:56.959 --> 00:40:58.127
Never.

00:40:58.193 --> 00:41:00.596
It's a duel between Valshare
and Imagine Dragon!

00:41:02.097 --> 00:41:03.332
Go.

00:41:05.834 --> 00:41:06.969
Go!

00:41:15.444 --> 00:41:17.046
Go!

00:41:17.112 --> 00:41:18.147
Go!

00:41:18.213 --> 00:41:19.214
Go!

00:41:19.281 --> 00:41:20.316
No! It's Royal Hope!

00:41:20.382 --> 00:41:21.483
Royal Hope is back!

00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:23.118
-Royal Hope is pouncing…
-Hope!

00:41:23.185 --> 00:41:23.919
-Hope!
-Go!

00:41:23.986 --> 00:41:25.721
-Hope!
-Hang in there!

00:41:25.788 --> 00:41:27.122
-Go!
-Go!

00:41:27.189 --> 00:41:28.424
Go!

00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:29.858
Imagine Dragon is…

00:41:29.925 --> 00:41:31.527
-Hang in there!
-Go!

00:41:31.594 --> 00:41:32.795
-Hope!
-Go!

00:41:32.861 --> 00:41:33.796
Go!

00:41:33.862 --> 00:41:36.031
Royal Hope!
Three horses reach the goal together!

00:41:36.098 --> 00:41:39.201
Which horse won?
It's impossible to tell the three apart!

00:41:39.268 --> 00:41:41.637
-Valshare? Imagine Dragon?
-Dad!

00:41:41.704 --> 00:41:44.206
Or Royal Hope?

00:41:44.273 --> 00:41:48.477
-Are you okay?
-Nakayama Racecourse. Race 11.

00:41:48.544 --> 00:41:52.247
-He made it.
-Please wait a moment.

00:42:24.046 --> 00:42:27.950
Nakayama Racecourse. Race 11.

00:42:28.017 --> 00:42:31.553
The first, second, and third places
are as follows…

00:42:32.121 --> 00:42:34.089
In first place, Number Four.

00:42:34.156 --> 00:42:37.159
-Yes!
-In second place, Number 15.

00:42:37.226 --> 00:42:41.463
In third place, Number 16.

00:42:59.348 --> 00:43:00.482
Damn it.

00:43:22.571 --> 00:43:26.141
Royal Hope! Thank you!

00:43:26.642 --> 00:43:29.244
-Thank you Hope!
-Hope!

00:43:31.647 --> 00:43:33.582
Hope!

00:43:36.985 --> 00:43:39.154
Hope! Thank you!

00:43:40.489 --> 00:43:41.390
Hope!

00:43:41.957 --> 00:43:43.125
Listen to them.

00:43:45.294 --> 00:43:47.563
Hope, it's all for you!

00:43:48.897 --> 00:43:51.834
Hope!

00:43:52.901 --> 00:43:53.836
Let's go.

00:43:53.902 --> 00:43:55.070
Hope!

00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:01.376
Hope, thank you!

00:44:18.794 --> 00:44:20.829
PRESIDENT

00:44:21.897 --> 00:44:23.065
Hello?

00:44:23.132 --> 00:44:24.800
What the heck was that email?

00:44:25.434 --> 00:44:28.504
-What?
-You make it sound like I'm about to die!

00:44:28.570 --> 00:44:32.474
Lately, aren't you talking
as if my death is a certainty?

00:44:32.541 --> 00:44:35.844
-Well…
-Come on! Don't kill me off yet!

00:44:35.911 --> 00:44:38.280
Go to the tempura place now!

00:44:38.347 --> 00:44:39.548
-Dad!
-What?

00:44:39.615 --> 00:44:41.250
It's not the time for tempura…

00:44:41.316 --> 00:44:44.753
Shut up! How can I die when I'm losing?

00:44:45.554 --> 00:44:47.923
I still have to find a bride for Hope.

00:44:49.858 --> 00:44:51.360
There's no time to rest.

00:44:54.830 --> 00:44:56.231
You're right.

00:44:57.366 --> 00:44:58.600
You're right!

00:45:16.819 --> 00:45:20.522
Mr. Kurisu, I apologize
for not coming the other day.

00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:22.825
I'd like to meet you sometime.

00:45:23.492 --> 00:45:27.830
I'd rather talk to you first,
before I talk to my father.

00:45:29.164 --> 00:45:30.833
Koichi Nakajo.

00:45:39.141 --> 00:45:40.242
Hope's foal?

00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:43.178
I will assist fully with the inheritance.

00:45:43.245 --> 00:45:47.115
Can you be there for them
when they really need you?

00:45:47.182 --> 00:45:49.051
Enough already.

00:45:49.117 --> 00:45:50.085
