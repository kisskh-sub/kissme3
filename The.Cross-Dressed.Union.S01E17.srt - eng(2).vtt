00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.600
I just feel that with my background

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.040
it's better not to get too close to you.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.520
What do you mean by that?

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.600
My family are military officers.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.040
We can't afford any trouble.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.440
Civil officials hold power now.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.760
They've always looked down on us.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.200
Those of us from military families.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.240
And now,

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.160
we're just pawns in their factional strife.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.800
My father's imprisonment is proof enough.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.720
I won't let that happen again.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.440
The Spring Imperial Examination is over.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.120
The new officials all seek civil-military integration.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.760
Soon,

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.080
that's your concern.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.360
I just want a peaceful life with my father.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.080
By the way,

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.280
where have you been lately?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Rui Wang said

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.240
you chased the human traffickers' remnants

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.560
and then disappeared.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.000
I chased those remnants

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.360
out of the city.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.400
I didn't expect they had accomplices.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.560
I was badly injured.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.600
I escaped to the mountain.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.240
My senior sister saved me.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.360
Martial Uncle was worried

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.120
someone in the capital might harm me.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.560
So he told me not to leave the mountain until I healed.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.960
He wouldn't let me send any messages either.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.920
So that's what happened.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.240
Martial Uncle Yu's concern

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.440
is not without reason.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.560
Martial Uncle really did a lot for me.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.840
Nan Chenxiao,

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.480
let's

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:31.840
move forward.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.640
Alright.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.080
Let's move forward together.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.480
Your Majesty,

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:48.920
Miss Qiao.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.120
Your Majesty.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.920
Slow down.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.760
Thank you.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.360
Why did you come up the mountain?

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:01.520
Your Majesty,

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.320
I had something to discuss with you.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.240
So I asked Second Young Master Rui to bring us up.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.000
But

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.200
we somehow got separated just now.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.600
Princess and Second Young Master Rui are missing.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.440
Yan Luo also came up the mountain.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.400
It's all my fault.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.520
I wanted to speak with Your Majesty,

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.640
so Second Young Master Rui led us up.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.160
Take her back.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.480
I'll go look for them.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.480
How long ago did you split up?

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.840
About half an hour ago.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.640
I came from that direction.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.520
Alright.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.400
Your Majesty,

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.360
this is a signal flare.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.720
Set it off later,

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.120
and the Chongming Guard will come for you.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.080
Your Majesty,

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.120
the Princess got lost because of me.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.560
I can't just leave her.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.160
Please take me with you.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.480
I won't cause any trouble.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.000
Then keep up on your own.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:21.800
It's pouring so hard.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.480
Why aren't they back yet?

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.000
Yeah.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.200
Liang Jin.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.520
You're back.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.160
You all came back.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:38.600
It's yours.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.280
Thank you, Fu Lu.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.400
Thank you, Lord Chongming.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:49.280
Let's go.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:50.240
Go.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.160
Hold it tight.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:57.240
What are you doing?

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.160
Bring the basin over.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.040
Coming, coming.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.080
I never thought country life was so fun.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.680
If you like it,

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.240
we can come up the mountain often.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.600
Martial Uncle may be a grumpy old man,

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.480
but he does enjoy lively company.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.880
Your Majesty and the others won't get lost, right?

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.440
Don't worry.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.320
Youyi grew up on this mountain.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.120
She could find her way back with her eyes closed.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:37.760
Is it that heavy?

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:38.760
Hold it steady, hold it steady.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.120
Miss Qiao.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.160
Careful.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.320
Watch out, the path is slippery.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.480
We can take shelter ahead.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.520
Put it on.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.080
Thank you, Miss Qiao.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.760
Your Majesty, you should wear it.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:37.480
No need.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.120
I see you've been shivering.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.440
You should wear it.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:42.560
Your Majesty's health is precious.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:43.960
Your Majesty should wear it.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.080
You should wear it.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:45.880
Still, Your—

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.040
They're just two worthless things.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.480
If you both don't want to wear them, forget it.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.880
No need to keep passing them around.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.000
Your Majesty,

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.000
your clothes are soaked.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:15.920
Go dry them by the fire.

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:16.960
No need.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.200
If you catch a chill,

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.320
who will lead us out?

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:25.920
That's true.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.520
If you two get sick,

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.000
I'll be in trouble.

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:34.120
That's not what I meant.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.440
Martial Uncle only has three rooms here.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.560
We must leave one for Your Majesty.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:58.760
Chongming and I

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.400
will squeeze into Martial Uncle's room.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.880
You and Youyi will have to share a room.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:04.800
Miss Qiao, she—

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.240
She knows everything now.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.040
This is clothing from Wurong Kingdom.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.400
Why is there a tear?

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:27.800
And bloodstains?

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.200
This belongs to Martial Uncle.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.200
Maybe when he went to Wurong before,

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.160
he wore it to gather intelligence.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.200
I see.

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.480
On the mountain,

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.360
the thunder sounds even closer.

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.240
I used to not be afraid.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.040
From now on, you won't need to be.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:09.400
I'm here with you.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.680
Nothing can hurt you now.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:27.920
Young Master Nan

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:31.440
What is it?

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.160
Your Majesty and the others
haven't returned yet.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:37.520
What should we do?

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.440
Let's go out and look for them.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.080
You're awake.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.480
The rain has stopped.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:04.600
Let's go.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.640
Wipe yourself off, be careful
not to catch a chill.

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:23.320
Let's go.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:28.280
Let's go.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.680
Sit closer to the fire too.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:40.800
Don't catch a cold.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.720
Weren't we out here
to look for my royal brother?

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.880
How did things end up like this?

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.440
Just bear with it for one night.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:53.440
Wait until tomorrow.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.160
Once it stops raining,
we can head out.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.480
But I'm hungry.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.080
This is all we have.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.080
Let me see if you have
anything else.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.760
Stop searching, it's all medicine.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.440
Why bring so many medicine jars
and no food?

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.080
I'm worried what if
we get hurt.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:25.600
I think the mountain
has plenty of resources.

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.400
Even if we get lost,
we can find food.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.000
But the medicine we need

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.280
might not be easy to find
right away.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.160
Why are you treating me like this?

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:47.480
Eat one.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:48.560
It'll make you feel full.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.800
Just one will make you
feel full.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:57.560
You're really eating it?

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.480
Feeling full isn't
actually being full.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.160
It's just psychological comfort.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:02.640
You...

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.480
What's that sound?

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.800
I'm not going to die here,
am I?

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:12.280
I haven't even met
Wang Guanshan yet.

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:15.040
I haven't had him write
Princess Chunxi's story.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.760
I'll regret this
for the rest of my life.

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:20.520
This regret—

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.040
I can help you fulfill
half of it.

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:26.600
You've already met
Wang Guanshan.

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:34.840
What are you talking about?

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.320
I don't understand.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.240
You, you...

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.720
Don't tell me you are—

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:17.920
Come.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:19.520
Your clothes are dry.

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:20.360
Put them on first.

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:21.560
Don't catch a cold.

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:39.720
What's wrong?

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:45.680
N-nothing.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.120
Second Young Master Rui

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:57.840
Second Brother Rui

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:58.800
Let's go.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.200
So polite now.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:03.800
Not calling me
a bad fox anymore.

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:06.400
I...

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:07.880
You first.

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:09.440
Don't talk to me yet.

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:14.160
What a pity.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.480
I was going to tell you

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:20.600
what my next story
will be about.

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:23.240
But it seems
you're not interested.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:24.280
Then let's go.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.760
What story are you writing?

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.440
Tell me!

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:31.880
What's your next book about?

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:35.160
You didn't finish
the carriage story last time.

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:36.800
Tell it, tell it!

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:38.640
Where did I leave off last time?

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.000
There was a princess.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.040
There was a princess.

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.280
She fell for a young master
disguised as a man.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.000
But this young master
disguised as a man

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:50.240
later married a general's daughter
disguised as a woman.

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.240
What kind of story is this?

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.840
Isn't this Nan Chenxiao?

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.200
Just missing Brother Yu.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.480
He's also disguised as a man.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.880
Brother Yu isn't the one
you're talking about, is he?

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.120
Uh...

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:08.160
Miss Qiao

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.080
Qiao...

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.920
Who is Miss Qiao?

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:14.920
Royal brother!

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:15.800
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.840
I thought I'd never
see you again.

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:18.760
Stand up straight.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.560
A princess should behave
with dignity.

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:23.200
And also—

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:26.280
Why did you sneak
out of the palace again?

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:29.440
It's because the top beam
is crooked, so the lower ones are too.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:31.920
Princess!

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.320
Wanwan!

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:34.160
Princess!

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:34.960
Wanwan!

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.440
That's great, that's great!

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:37.840
I'm glad you're safe.

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:40.240
If something happened to you,
what would I do?

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:41.760
I'm fine, what about you?

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:42.960
I'm fine too.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.200
Let's hurry back.

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.520
Lord Rui and my junior sister
must be worried.

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:47.560
I'm really fine.

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:48.840
Miss Qiao is right.

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:50.520
We sheltered from the rain
and made a fire.

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:51.360
I was so worried!

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.400
I wonder if they found
shelter from the rain.

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:00.920
My lord, slow down.

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:02.360
Stay close.

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:03.320
Don't get separated.

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.160
It's a signal from Your Majesty.

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:13.600
That way.

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:14.440
Let's go.

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:20.760
Go.

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:22.280
Let's go, Wanwan.

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:29.480
What's wrong?

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.160
Your Majesty, I have
something to tell you.

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.480
May I speak with you
in private?

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:38.800
Do you have something

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.320
you can't let us hear?

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.880
Wait here for a moment.

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.000
Royal brother.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.080
Give your royal brother

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:51.160
some space.

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:06.000
So many people going
to my master—

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:07.320
He might not be happy,
not to mention—

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.080
What about my junior sister's identity?

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:14.880
That's true.

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:18.240
I wonder if there's
anywhere to stay on the mountain.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.840
Second Young Master Rui
and Yan Luo both know.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:25.760
It's just—

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:26.960
Miss Ming

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:35.240
Royal brother, where are you going?

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:35.960
Don't go over there.

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:39.280
Your Majesty!

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:40.080
You all—

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:41.000
Your Majesty!

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.160
What's going on?

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.080
Ming Wanwan, Princess Chunxi,

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:46.240
and your second brother
are here.

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:49.840
Why did they come?

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:51.120
They're here to find me.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.080
Yan Luo and Rui Wang
are both fine.

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:55.520
Mainly—

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.160
Why are you staring at me?

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:04.920
Yes.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.240
Ming Wanwan.

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:09.920
This is such a hassle.

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:11.200
How about you

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.480
go hide in the room for now, don't come out.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:16.680
Then how long

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:18.160
do I have to hide?

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:20.880
Tomorrow at dawn,

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:22.840
I'll go down the mountain with them.

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:26.560
Alright.

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:31.280
Let's head back then.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.000
Your Majesty, take care.

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.040
My master likes peace and quiet.

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:52.600
Please rest in the courtyard.

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:53.840
Go down the mountain at first light.

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:55.800
Sorry for disturbing you.

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.360
But I'm hungry.

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.000
I'll make you something to eat.

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:00.040
Thank you, Miss Qiao.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.080
You're so kind.

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:10.280
Come.

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:11.360
Let's sit for a while too.

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:15.480
Let me help you.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.200
Alright.

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:20.560
Are you hungry?

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:23.040
Food will be ready soon.

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:30.960
Your Majesty.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.880
I have something to tell you.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:35.720
Wait a moment.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:37.240
It's about state affairs.

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:39.240
I...

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:40.960
I'll be back soon.

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:41.960
If you need anything,

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.480
just ask Chongming.

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:54.320
Your back must be sore.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:06.800
What's the matter?

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.960
Pingxiang merchants are about to enter the capital.

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:13.240
Rui family's eldest brother is in charge.

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.560
But he's always been unruly.

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.160
So I'm worried something might go wrong.

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:20.720
That's what my father told me.

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.200
It's a complicated matter.

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:24.000
That's why I'm concerned.

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.760
You should tell Rui Yu about this.

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.440
Why are you telling me?

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:30.800
Could it be...

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:33.440
I was too hasty and rude.

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:34.680
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:36.760
I understand.

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:38.160
You've worked hard.

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.520
It's my duty to do this.

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:44.960
You've been busy all day.

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:45.680
You must be tired.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.560
Go inside and rest.

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:48.920
I'm not tired.

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:50.520
I can still help out.

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:51.960
Let's go.

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:02.760
Miss Qiao, you're amazing.

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.680
Come to the palace and be my teacher.

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:09.920
Princess, I appreciate your kindness.

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.640
But I'm used to being free.

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:13.320
Life in the palace is too restrictive.

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.280
That's true.

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:16.360
I think so too.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:19.000
Life outside the palace is much more fun.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:27.040
Miss Qiao.

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:27.920
Is this enough?

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:29.000
It's enough.

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:36.480
Before the rain, I saw the flower's core.

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:39.680
After the rain, no flower beneath the leaves.

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:55.760
Is there something on my face?

00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.160
That's odd.

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:02.080
Why didn't I notice before?

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:06.760
Notice what?

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:07.400
It's nothing.

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.640
When are we having dinner?

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:12.280
Eating in the mountains,

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:13.520
we have to work first.

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:15.560
Come.

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:16.840
Let's shell beans.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.480
But I don't know how.

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:20.840
Come, I'll teach you.

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.280
Let me help you serve.

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:55.160
Wanwan.

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.560
Come help shell beans.

00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:58.600
No beans, no dinner tonight.

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:05.040
Let's do it together.

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:16.160
It's so lively.

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:17.680
What a pity.

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.160
We can only stay inside.

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:20.720
Someday,

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:23.240
you'll meet them openly and proudly.

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:26.680
Take off your coat.

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:27.920
I'll help you apply medicine.

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:30.680
Uh...

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.120
Isn't this a bit inappropriate?

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:34.080
We're husband and wife.

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:35.480
What's wrong with that?

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:36.160
Hurry up.

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:18.880
Does it hurt?

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:20.880
No.

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:40.640
My wound is almost healed.

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:42.560
No need for more medicine.

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:45.360
Your ears are so red.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.280
Did you catch a cold?

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:52.680
Stop messing around.

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:55.280
I'm not messing around.

00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:57.920
Let's sleep.

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:18.480
Don't catch a chill.

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:26.680
There are many poisonous insects here.

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:28.000
Don't get hurt.

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.960
I know you're mad at me.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:38.080
I came up here to explain things to you.

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:40.880
I'm not angry.

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:42.280
Then look at me.

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.440
I just think

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:53.000
Ming Wanwan

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.760
is the one best suited to stand by your side.

00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:59.120
She's not.

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.800
She's the most famous talent in the capital.

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:06.680
Stunningly beautiful.

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:08.160
Graceful and well-mannered.

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:10.400
The Empress Dowager

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:11.800
likes her very much too.

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:14.920
But I don't like her.

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:18.280
I like you.

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:26.840
You're a cloud in the sky.

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:29.920
I can only chase you from the ground.

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:32.720
Even if our hearts connect, so what?

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:37.160
You're not Young Master Lin.

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.800
And I'm just Miss Qiao.

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:45.960
If military officers regain power,

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.440
our statuses

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:49.640
won't be an unbridgeable gap.

00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:00.400
Tonight, the mountain wind feels warmer.

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:06.560
Yes.

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:08.000
Spring is here.

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:10.920
It's getting warmer.

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:26.960
You're awake.

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:28.320
Sleep a bit more.

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.480
Why are you up already?

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:34.960
What if Miss Ming and the others see you?

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:36.960
Youyi already took them down the mountain.

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.040
They've gone down.

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:41.960
Everything that needed to be said is said.

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:43.720
Staying here is pointless.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.600
The mountain air is so fresh.

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:54.240
I want to come back and visit again.

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:55.640
Next time,

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:56.680
I'll take you to climb another mountain.

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:57.360
Sure!

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:00.320
Careful!

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:01.080
It's fine.

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:03.120
Princess, slow down.

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:11.800
Watch out.

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:18.040
You're being too careless.

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:36.120
Wanwan, slow down.

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:37.560
Be careful.

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.200
Just keep walking straight on this path

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.400
and you'll reach the foot of the mountain.

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:44.640
Miss Qiao, aren't you coming with us?

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:45.200
No.

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:46.880
I'm staying on the mountain a while longer.

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:48.240
Let's part ways here, then.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:49.200
Alright.

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.200
Goodbye, Miss Qiao.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:52.680
Farewell.

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:54.320
Let's go.

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:55.120
Take it slow.
