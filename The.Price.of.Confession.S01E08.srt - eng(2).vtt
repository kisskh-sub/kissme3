00:00:46.693 --> 00:00:48.570
What do you mean, he's dead?

00:00:52.365 --> 00:00:54.200
I received a photo.

00:00:55.451 --> 00:00:57.287
Not a fake one like this.

00:00:58.413 --> 00:01:00.874
But a real one of Ko Se-hun, dead.

00:01:04.043 --> 00:01:05.170
Where is this photo?

00:01:06.546 --> 00:01:07.380
It's gone.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.049
I tore it up and ate it.

00:01:11.676 --> 00:01:12.635
You ate it?

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:16.848
Do you find this amusing?

00:01:18.016 --> 00:01:20.852
What if there were

00:01:21.769 --> 00:01:24.522
someone else
who wanted him dead besides us?

00:01:26.274 --> 00:01:27.442
What if

00:01:28.443 --> 00:01:31.613
that someone killed him to get to you?

00:01:32.906 --> 00:01:35.200
Who else would do such a thing
besides you?

00:01:39.704 --> 00:01:41.372
What the hell have you done?

00:02:18.493 --> 00:02:19.702
-Is he dead?
-No way.

00:02:32.423 --> 00:02:33.716
-Let's go.
-This way.

00:02:35.718 --> 00:02:37.178
I heard he went missing.

00:02:40.765 --> 00:02:41.849
Oh my God!

00:02:41.933 --> 00:02:43.184
-What is it?
-Is he dead?

00:02:43.268 --> 00:02:44.352
I think he's dead!

00:03:28.688 --> 00:03:29.897
Ms. An.

00:03:38.698 --> 00:03:40.366
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.452
He was found in that freezer.

00:03:49.625 --> 00:03:53.421
Turns out Ko Se-hun was on trial
two years ago.

00:03:54.297 --> 00:03:55.340
On trial?

00:03:55.423 --> 00:03:56.257
Yes.

00:03:59.552 --> 00:04:02.096
It was a juvenile case,
so the court kept it sealed.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.598
PROTECTIVE DETENTION NO. 5

00:04:03.681 --> 00:04:06.768
-It went unreported due to COVID-19.
-And the victim's family?

00:04:07.393 --> 00:04:10.229
Both the victim and her father
committed suicide.

00:04:12.523 --> 00:04:14.901
I'll look into the rest of the family too.

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.696
He hasn't said a word.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.075
He lost his son and daughter-in-law.

00:05:04.575 --> 00:05:06.786
And now his grandson. It's no wonder.

00:05:12.667 --> 00:05:14.377
Sir, I--

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.294
May I

00:05:16.796 --> 00:05:18.297
go now?

00:05:19.298 --> 00:05:20.675
I'm sure we need to talk.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.510
Let's talk next time.

00:05:31.769 --> 00:05:33.020
Later this afternoon,

00:05:34.147 --> 00:05:36.065
Se-hun's autopsy will take place.

00:05:37.233 --> 00:05:38.443
I'll be in touch, sir.

00:05:43.823 --> 00:05:45.533
We have tragic news.

00:05:45.616 --> 00:05:48.202
Ko Se-hun, who went missing last Friday,

00:05:48.286 --> 00:05:51.456
was found dead this afternoon.

00:05:52.957 --> 00:05:57.378
This is the house that's been vacant
for months since Ko's parents' murder.

00:05:57.879 --> 00:06:02.091
Ko was discovered frozen
inside a freezer in the basement.

00:06:02.633 --> 00:06:05.636
The police suspect Ko,
who went missing last Friday evening,

00:06:06.137 --> 00:06:09.307
was murdered
after being imprisoned inside this house.

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:12.768
They are looking for leads
through forensic examination.

00:06:12.852 --> 00:06:14.353
Why are you staring at me?

00:06:14.437 --> 00:06:17.064
Authorities have stated
that signs of a struggle…

00:06:17.148 --> 00:06:18.191
It wasn't you,

00:06:19.859 --> 00:06:20.693
was it?

00:06:20.776 --> 00:06:22.945
…Ko would have suffered extreme pain.

00:06:23.446 --> 00:06:25.656
-No suspect has been identified yet.
-What was?

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.743
With a possible connection
to Ko's parents' murder in mind…

00:06:28.826 --> 00:06:29.702
Never mind.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:36.209
Four months after his parents' murder,
Ko has also been brutally murdered.

00:06:36.709 --> 00:06:38.377
The tragic news of this family

00:06:38.461 --> 00:06:41.714
has left the public in shock and mourning,
while also raising questions…

00:06:55.478 --> 00:06:57.480
According to authorities,

00:06:57.563 --> 00:07:00.733
the brutal murder
and the method of body disposal

00:07:00.816 --> 00:07:03.653
point toward premeditation
rather than a spontaneous act.

00:07:03.736 --> 00:07:07.573
Further investigation is underway
to determine the exact cause of death.

00:07:07.657 --> 00:07:11.577
The police are tracking
the suspect's movements…

00:07:11.661 --> 00:07:12.662
LAWYER JANG JEONG-GU

00:07:12.745 --> 00:07:15.623
…by reviewing CCTV footage and entry logs
surrounding the crime scene.

00:07:15.706 --> 00:07:18.668
They have also requested an autopsy
from the NFS

00:07:18.751 --> 00:07:22.630
to determine the exact time of death
and how the murder was carried out

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:26.551
and are conducting a thorough analysis
of the crime scene evidence.

00:07:26.634 --> 00:07:30.888
Mun-jun, can you pick Sop up
from the kindergarten?

00:07:30.972 --> 00:07:34.684
And please look after her for a few days.
I'll explain everything later.

00:07:35.184 --> 00:07:36.519
Please take good care of her.

00:07:36.602 --> 00:07:39.939
Meanwhile, a past interview with Mo,
who murdered Ko's parents,

00:07:40.022 --> 00:07:41.774
has attracted renewed attention.

00:07:41.857 --> 00:07:43.359
Here's what she said.

00:07:44.151 --> 00:07:45.903
I'm sure you know,

00:07:46.529 --> 00:07:50.032
but your mom and dad
weren't exactly good people.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.368
Blame your parents

00:07:53.869 --> 00:07:55.663
for making you pay the price.

00:07:56.455 --> 00:07:58.958
Mo's remarks sparked
a major controversy at the time…

00:07:59.041 --> 00:08:00.251
What if there were

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.796
someone else
who wanted him dead besides us?

00:08:04.922 --> 00:08:06.173
What if

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:10.261
that someone killed him to get to you?

00:08:11.262 --> 00:08:15.266
The police are focusing on
uncovering the motive and the connection

00:08:15.349 --> 00:08:16.642
between the two cases.

00:08:17.143 --> 00:08:21.355
Currently, the investigation team
is conducting various background checks,

00:08:21.439 --> 00:08:23.649
including on Ko Se-hun's family ties.

00:08:24.358 --> 00:08:28.946
In particular, Ko's friends and neighbors
provided character statements about him,

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:32.116
helping the team establish
the context of the case.

00:08:32.617 --> 00:08:36.329
The police are also checking CCTV footage
and communication records

00:08:36.412 --> 00:08:39.874
to trace his movements
before and after the incident.

00:08:45.046 --> 00:08:46.464
So who is it?

00:08:57.892 --> 00:08:58.726
Ruler.

00:09:06.108 --> 00:09:07.234
3.0 cm.

00:09:11.656 --> 00:09:12.657
2.5 cm.

00:09:16.077 --> 00:09:17.119
3.5 cm.

00:09:18.537 --> 00:09:19.580
3.5 cm.

00:09:24.919 --> 00:09:28.172
This may be very distressing, sir.
Would you still like to stay?

00:09:34.387 --> 00:09:35.221
Scalpel.

00:10:11.757 --> 00:10:15.010
The immediate cause of death
was the four stab wounds to the neck…

00:10:15.094 --> 00:10:16.846
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

00:10:16.929 --> 00:10:19.515
…piercing the carotid artery.
There's a clear strangulation mark

00:10:19.598 --> 00:10:21.600
and signs of urinary incontinence.

00:10:23.436 --> 00:10:25.146
Signs of urinary incontinence?

00:10:25.646 --> 00:10:27.940
So they strangled him
with the intent to kill?

00:10:28.441 --> 00:10:29.775
It means they almost did.

00:10:29.859 --> 00:10:31.861
But they finished him off with a knife?

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:34.113
And the estimated time of death?

00:10:34.613 --> 00:10:37.450
The frozen state of the body
makes things uncertain.

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:39.952
But the burger remnants
found in his stomach

00:10:40.035 --> 00:10:43.080
indicate he died
about two hours after consumption.

00:10:44.415 --> 00:10:45.875
I understand. Thank you.

00:10:47.126 --> 00:10:48.210
Thank you.

00:10:54.675 --> 00:10:55.509
Sir.

00:10:57.428 --> 00:10:59.221
I'd like to hear from you now.

00:11:01.849 --> 00:11:03.476
When you reported him missing,

00:11:03.559 --> 00:11:06.520
you said he wouldn't be able to return
to his old neighborhood.

00:11:07.563 --> 00:11:08.773
I don't recall.

00:11:10.691 --> 00:11:14.445
Was that due to the incident
that put Se-hun in court two years ago?

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:16.697
I don't know.

00:11:24.288 --> 00:11:27.333
It drove the victim and her father
to commit suicide.

00:11:27.917 --> 00:11:29.251
You know that, don't you?

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.129
I don't know.

00:11:32.922 --> 00:11:33.756
Sir.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:38.761
You need to tell us everything you know.

00:11:39.261 --> 00:11:40.179
So we can--

00:11:40.262 --> 00:11:42.932
I don't really know
anything about that incident.

00:11:43.849 --> 00:11:47.353
I was estranged from my late son
and his wife.

00:12:01.909 --> 00:12:04.078
I HOPE HE DESERVES TO DIE

00:12:04.161 --> 00:12:06.956
I'LL ALWAYS WATCH YOU AND ROOT FOR YOU
WHEREVER YOU ARE AND WHATEVER YOU DO

00:12:22.429 --> 00:12:24.223
You don't have much time.

00:12:26.642 --> 00:12:28.352
Don't get any funny ideas.

00:12:32.606 --> 00:12:35.526
If you don't kill him, someone else will.

00:12:37.027 --> 00:12:40.030
If that person fails,
I'll send another person.

00:12:40.114 --> 00:12:41.448
Either way…

00:12:44.076 --> 00:12:45.327
that kid

00:12:46.161 --> 00:12:47.288
is going to die.

00:13:15.232 --> 00:13:16.942
LAWYER JANG JEONG-GU

00:13:19.778 --> 00:13:22.406
POOJIM BAKERY & CAFÉ

00:13:56.565 --> 00:13:58.901
I had asked Mr. Jin for a favor.

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:01.445
To help me meet with Mo Eun.

00:14:03.822 --> 00:14:07.117
I wanted to know why she attempted suicide
just before testifying.

00:14:08.786 --> 00:14:09.662
But then

00:14:09.745 --> 00:14:13.040
I saw you at the hospital,
running off in a lab coat.

00:14:15.084 --> 00:14:15.918
Second floor.

00:14:18.337 --> 00:14:19.546
Doors closing.

00:14:23.592 --> 00:14:25.719
I thought, "What is Ms. An doing here?"

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:30.474
"Why is she in a lab coat?"
"Where's she going in such a hurry?"

00:14:32.184 --> 00:14:34.478
Why were you at the missing kid's… No.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.022
Why were you at the scene of his death?

00:14:37.731 --> 00:14:38.732
How did you know?

00:14:40.651 --> 00:14:42.778
Did you have something to do with it?

00:14:43.445 --> 00:14:45.906
Did you really make
some kind of deal with the Witch?

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:49.493
Please say something.

00:14:50.035 --> 00:14:51.537
I'm your lawyer.

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:53.580
At least let me pretend to trust you!

00:15:02.881 --> 00:15:06.051
There's something
I've always wanted to ask but never did.

00:15:07.678 --> 00:15:09.430
Why did you appoint me

00:15:10.723 --> 00:15:11.724
as your lawyer?

00:15:13.434 --> 00:15:14.685
You should leave now.

00:15:15.644 --> 00:15:16.729
Ms. An.

00:16:05.652 --> 00:16:06.987
Oh, that's ours.

00:16:09.573 --> 00:16:10.741
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

00:16:10.824 --> 00:16:11.992
Let's sit at the back.

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:22.461
Coffee will be served soon.

00:16:27.508 --> 00:16:28.509
Please enjoy.

00:16:28.592 --> 00:16:29.593
Thank you.

00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:09.633
I'm just taking a two-hour nap.

00:17:17.599 --> 00:17:19.935
Huh? Yun-su!

00:17:20.018 --> 00:17:22.563
You've lost even more weight
since last time.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.482
-Are you here with Sop?
-Was it you?

00:17:26.316 --> 00:17:27.776
That kid, Ko Se-hun.

00:17:28.485 --> 00:17:29.778
Was it you?

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:32.656
What do you mean?

00:17:32.739 --> 00:17:34.825
Didn't you kill him
because Mo Eun told you to?

00:17:35.617 --> 00:17:36.702
I killed him?

00:17:40.831 --> 00:17:41.665
Let go.

00:17:43.876 --> 00:17:45.085
What are you doing?

00:17:48.839 --> 00:17:49.882
Stay still.

00:17:54.219 --> 00:17:55.637
Enter your passcode.

00:18:18.285 --> 00:18:20.204
You're not close with Mo Eun, are you?

00:18:23.457 --> 00:18:25.751
Yu-ri! Not there.
It's in the storage room.

00:18:25.834 --> 00:18:27.002
-Don't move.
-Bring two.

00:18:27.085 --> 00:18:27.920
This one?

00:18:28.879 --> 00:18:30.339
My parents own this place.

00:18:32.466 --> 00:18:34.468
If I scream right now,

00:18:35.052 --> 00:18:36.970
everyone outside will come running in.

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:39.890
But I won't.

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:43.435
Because Mo Eun told me to just watch you.

00:18:43.936 --> 00:18:45.687
What does she have on you?

00:18:46.813 --> 00:18:47.814
Have on me?

00:18:49.358 --> 00:18:50.317
She's got nothing.

00:18:52.152 --> 00:18:53.362
Because Mo Eun

00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:55.781
is a good person.

00:18:55.864 --> 00:18:57.241
Do you trust that woman?

00:18:59.368 --> 00:19:01.828
She saved my life.

00:19:03.288 --> 00:19:06.166
And she extended a hand to me, the fatty…

00:19:08.168 --> 00:19:09.753
who no one ever cared about.

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:19.763
The victim had an older sister

00:19:20.264 --> 00:19:21.348
named Kang So-hae.

00:19:22.516 --> 00:19:26.853
She died in a car fire a year ago
near the Chiang Rai border.

00:19:28.313 --> 00:19:29.606
The sister, Kang So-hae,

00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:32.651
moved to Germany
at the age of 17 to study.

00:19:32.734 --> 00:19:34.278
She finished medical school there

00:19:34.861 --> 00:19:36.905
and did
international medical volunteer work.

00:19:38.407 --> 00:19:40.867
She was in a refugee camp in Chiang Rai
for two years.

00:19:40.951 --> 00:19:44.496
There's little to no record of her
here in Korea though.

00:19:44.579 --> 00:19:47.082
Please contact someone
in Chiang Rai yourself.

00:19:47.582 --> 00:19:48.667
All right, I will.

00:19:49.167 --> 00:19:50.002
Okay.

00:19:58.593 --> 00:20:00.053
PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE

00:20:04.391 --> 00:20:05.809
So

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:09.313
this was an open-and-shut case at first.

00:20:09.396 --> 00:20:11.481
CASE NUMBER: 2020 PU 14
CLIENT: KANG SO-MANG

00:20:11.565 --> 00:20:14.735
"The male student sexually assaulted
the female student after getting her drunk

00:20:14.818 --> 00:20:16.778
and secretly filmed it."

00:20:16.862 --> 00:20:18.030
That was the story.

00:20:18.613 --> 00:20:22.034
The evidence was solid,
and the perpetrator also admitted to it.

00:20:23.118 --> 00:20:25.495
But the trial dynamics changed?

00:20:26.121 --> 00:20:28.165
The perpetrator's family

00:20:29.416 --> 00:20:30.584
was quite influential.

00:20:30.667 --> 00:20:32.753
They'd pulled strings here and there.

00:20:33.462 --> 00:20:34.921
All the testimonies

00:20:35.005 --> 00:20:38.925
started to turn against the victim.

00:20:39.509 --> 00:20:40.886
They said, "It wasn't rape."

00:20:40.969 --> 00:20:43.472
"She drank with him
and came on to him first."

00:20:43.972 --> 00:20:47.559
And one even stated
that she was a sugar baby.

00:20:49.019 --> 00:20:52.439
Did Kang So-mang take her own life
because of those rumors?

00:20:55.442 --> 00:20:57.069
It wasn't just the rumors.

00:20:57.736 --> 00:21:01.114
During the trial,
the perpetrator distributed the video

00:21:01.198 --> 00:21:03.617
to her acquaintances.

00:21:04.201 --> 00:21:07.621
Basically, to everyone
in her phone contacts.

00:21:30.727 --> 00:21:31.728
Please.

00:21:34.106 --> 00:21:35.899
Please pick up.

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:41.947
MY SIS♥

00:21:43.448 --> 00:21:45.242
I told you that you'd pay for this.

00:21:45.992 --> 00:21:47.327
Did you think I couldn't?

00:21:47.411 --> 00:21:48.578
KO SE-HUN
TO: ME, 146 MORE

00:21:50.747 --> 00:21:51.665
ONE VIDEO ATTACHMENT

00:22:10.517 --> 00:22:11.351
Don't.

00:22:11.852 --> 00:22:13.937
-Stay still.
-Should I film it?

00:22:14.646 --> 00:22:15.480
I'm fine.

00:22:15.981 --> 00:22:17.816
Start filming. I said stay still.

00:22:35.542 --> 00:22:37.878
But all he got
was Protective Detention No. 5?

00:22:39.838 --> 00:22:40.672
He was a minor.

00:23:00.775 --> 00:23:04.488
THE LATE KANG SO-MANG

00:23:23.798 --> 00:23:24.966
She just got discharged.

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:26.718
A proper procedure will--

00:23:26.801 --> 00:23:30.388
Shall we go to the prosecutor's office
or handle it here?

00:23:31.389 --> 00:23:32.265
Here is fine.

00:23:52.327 --> 00:23:53.161
In the end,

00:23:53.787 --> 00:23:54.996
Ko Se-hun also died.

00:23:57.624 --> 00:23:58.917
How do you feel?

00:24:00.293 --> 00:24:01.670
Couldn't say.

00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:13.807
"2020 Pu 14, Defendant Ko Se-hun."

00:24:14.641 --> 00:24:16.977
"Violation of the Youth Protection Act."

00:24:17.936 --> 00:24:20.647
"Verdict on the Production
and Distribution of Obscenity."

00:24:28.947 --> 00:24:30.323
"The defendant, Ko Se-hun,

00:24:30.407 --> 00:24:33.952
is charged with recording a video
of himself

00:24:34.661 --> 00:24:37.581
engaged in sexual activities
with the victim

00:24:37.664 --> 00:24:40.834
and sending it to everyone
in her phone contacts."

00:24:45.338 --> 00:24:47.132
You look as if you have no idea

00:24:47.632 --> 00:24:49.217
what I'm talking about.

00:24:56.850 --> 00:25:00.979
If he sent it to everyone
in the victim's contact list,

00:25:02.022 --> 00:25:05.233
I suppose her father
and her older sister saw it too.

00:25:06.318 --> 00:25:07.485
She would've been devastated.

00:25:08.862 --> 00:25:10.905
That's why she took her own life.

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:15.368
And her father, guilt-stricken
for failing to protect his daughter,

00:25:15.452 --> 00:25:16.536
made the same choice.

00:25:17.537 --> 00:25:18.830
Her only sister

00:25:19.331 --> 00:25:21.041
died in a car accident in Thailand.

00:25:24.961 --> 00:25:25.795
Goodness…

00:25:26.796 --> 00:25:28.048
What a tragic family.

00:25:30.342 --> 00:25:31.176
Yes.

00:25:35.513 --> 00:25:37.098
You wouldn't have heard this.

00:25:37.766 --> 00:25:40.310
It's a statement
from the victim's classmate, "P."

00:25:42.103 --> 00:25:43.104
"The victim

00:25:43.938 --> 00:25:46.232
had shown interest in the defendant,

00:25:46.733 --> 00:25:50.278
and I witnessed excessive physical contact
between them at a drinking party."

00:25:50.362 --> 00:25:52.280
"The victim, Kang So-mang,

00:25:53.865 --> 00:25:56.534
also spoke about her own experience
with sugar daddies

00:25:57.827 --> 00:25:58.953
and encouraged it."

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.081
"As a result,

00:26:01.581 --> 00:26:04.250
it is difficult to conclude
that the defendant

00:26:04.334 --> 00:26:08.171
sexually assaulted Kang So-mang
through coercion based on the statements."

00:26:08.254 --> 00:26:09.255
"Rather,

00:26:09.839 --> 00:26:14.052
it is more reasonable to find credibility
in the defendant's claim

00:26:14.552 --> 00:26:17.806
that sexual intercourse took place
with mutual consent."

00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:25.897
Kang So-hae, Kang So-mang's sister…

00:26:27.732 --> 00:26:30.402
If she's alive,
her rage will be unimaginable.

00:26:30.902 --> 00:26:33.238
She would've thought about
nothing but revenge.

00:26:34.072 --> 00:26:36.574
People would've mistaken that
for psychopathy,

00:26:36.658 --> 00:26:39.703
making it difficult to find any grudge
between you and your victims.

00:26:40.203 --> 00:26:41.663
As for the polygraph,

00:26:41.746 --> 00:26:45.166
the responses to the baseline questions
were false to begin with,

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:46.710
so it had to be inconclusive.

00:26:47.377 --> 00:26:50.046
Is your name Mo Eun?

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:50.964
Yes.

00:26:56.386 --> 00:26:58.012
Kang So-hae is alive,

00:26:59.139 --> 00:27:01.474
and it was some other woman
who died in Thailand.

00:27:02.934 --> 00:27:05.186
I wonder how that poor woman
ended up dying.

00:27:11.359 --> 00:27:12.193
So

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:16.156
what are you trying to say?

00:27:22.704 --> 00:27:24.497
You couldn't bear that Ko Se-hun

00:27:25.081 --> 00:27:25.999
was alive.

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:29.878
That's why you used An Yun-su
and offered her a deal.

00:27:34.257 --> 00:27:35.258
In the end,

00:27:36.801 --> 00:27:37.719
it's back to

00:27:38.344 --> 00:27:39.804
An Yun-su, isn't it?

00:27:47.479 --> 00:27:48.438
You did not

00:27:49.147 --> 00:27:50.565
kill Lee Ki-dae.

00:27:51.608 --> 00:27:53.902
You did medical volunteer work
in a refugee camp,

00:27:53.985 --> 00:27:56.696
spending years in a remote place
to save just one more life.

00:27:57.739 --> 00:27:59.574
That's who Kang So-hae really is.

00:28:00.909 --> 00:28:03.578
She couldn't kill anyone without a grudge.

00:28:08.917 --> 00:28:10.335
DETECTIVE RYU JI-SU

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:14.422
Yes, go ahead.

00:28:14.506 --> 00:28:17.634
We got the test results
for the hair collected at the crime scene.

00:28:18.134 --> 00:28:20.220
It came back to An Yun-su.

00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:23.473
Right, understood.

00:28:27.101 --> 00:28:28.728
Because of your revenge,

00:28:29.562 --> 00:28:31.523
An Yun-su has become a murderer again.

00:28:33.191 --> 00:28:34.859
This is on you.

00:28:37.821 --> 00:28:38.863
Can I go now?

00:28:45.954 --> 00:28:46.788
Oh yeah.

00:28:48.164 --> 00:28:49.624
An Yun-su

00:28:50.416 --> 00:28:52.126
did not kill Ko Se-hun.

00:28:55.964 --> 00:28:58.174
That's who she really is.

00:29:13.231 --> 00:29:14.607
GANGAN DAILY

00:29:19.112 --> 00:29:20.196
This is Hong Se-yeong.

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:24.450
I'm calling because I have information
on Ko Se-hun, the murder victim.

00:29:24.951 --> 00:29:26.828
Right. One moment, please.

00:29:30.373 --> 00:29:33.209
What kind of information would it be?

00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:37.213
There's a connection between the Witch

00:29:37.297 --> 00:29:38.840
and Ko Se-hun's past crime.

00:29:38.923 --> 00:29:42.886
If it's not much trouble,
may I ask who's calling?

00:29:42.969 --> 00:29:44.846
Please just call me an anonymous source.

00:29:45.346 --> 00:29:48.016
Okay, sure. Please continue.

00:29:59.694 --> 00:30:02.447
It's a statement
from the victim's classmate, "P."

00:30:02.947 --> 00:30:04.657
"The victim, Kang So-Mang,

00:30:04.741 --> 00:30:06.743
had shown interest in the defendant."

00:30:07.243 --> 00:30:11.372
"She spoke about her own experience
with sugar daddies and encouraged it."

00:30:24.177 --> 00:30:26.596
KO SE-HUN'S JUVENILE COURT RECORD REVEALED

00:30:26.679 --> 00:30:29.140
INVESTIGATION PROBING
POTENTIAL REVENGE MOTIVE

00:30:33.436 --> 00:30:34.270
Wait here.

00:30:49.911 --> 00:30:50.912
Inmate 407,

00:30:51.412 --> 00:30:54.123
wait until visitation's over
and head back with the others.

00:31:09.013 --> 00:31:10.848
Damn it. I'm off now.

00:31:46.592 --> 00:31:50.013
Controversy over poor construction
has come under scrutiny once more.

00:31:51.889 --> 00:31:55.143
Hey! Did you go and see your boyfriend?
You little brat.

00:31:56.477 --> 00:31:57.478
He's not my boyfriend.

00:31:57.562 --> 00:32:01.357
If a guy shows up at a women's prison,
he's either your boyfriend or creditor.

00:32:03.526 --> 00:32:06.738
Fortunately, it has been confirmed
that their lives are not at risk.

00:32:07.238 --> 00:32:08.531
However, future residents…

00:32:08.614 --> 00:32:12.285
I thought you'd live on hospital food
for longer. That was damn quick.

00:32:12.368 --> 00:32:14.912
…are planning collective action.

00:32:14.996 --> 00:32:16.664
The Land and Transport Ministry is…

00:32:16.748 --> 00:32:19.459
Hey, how come you two didn't buy
anything today either?

00:32:19.542 --> 00:32:22.170
You don't have anyone
to send you commissary money?

00:32:22.670 --> 00:32:23.796
Man.

00:32:24.589 --> 00:32:27.717
Hey, come here.
Snacks are on me today. Eat up.

00:32:28.801 --> 00:32:30.553
What? What's going on between you two?

00:32:30.636 --> 00:32:31.721
Did you fight?

00:32:32.305 --> 00:32:33.806
Save it for after eating!

00:32:34.307 --> 00:32:38.352
The juvenile court records
of the late Ko Se-hun have been released.

00:32:38.436 --> 00:32:40.229
This disclosure

00:32:40.313 --> 00:32:44.192
has triggered a new round of investigation
into his death.

00:32:44.859 --> 00:32:45.985
Based on the records…

00:32:46.069 --> 00:32:48.196
Can you repeat what you said to me

00:32:49.489 --> 00:32:50.490
that day?

00:32:50.573 --> 00:32:55.036
…investigating whether his prior offenses
may be connected to his death.

00:32:56.454 --> 00:32:59.123
You said his family got divine punishment.

00:33:00.833 --> 00:33:03.086
I believe that's what you said.

00:33:05.713 --> 00:33:06.798
You know,

00:33:08.132 --> 00:33:10.551
I actually knew the people you killed.

00:33:15.723 --> 00:33:16.808
You see,

00:33:18.476 --> 00:33:21.229
I believe what they got
was divine punishment.

00:33:34.659 --> 00:33:36.244
You're "P," aren't you?

00:33:37.203 --> 00:33:40.957
It has been confirmed that Mo,
the dentist couple murder case suspect,

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:43.960
has assumed a false identity.

00:33:44.043 --> 00:33:47.463
According to the investigation,
the suspect's real surname is Kang.

00:33:47.547 --> 00:33:50.466
At 17, she was selected
as a state-funded overseas student.

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:53.094
She graduated from medical school
in Germany,

00:33:53.177 --> 00:33:54.178
and in Chiang Rai…

00:33:54.262 --> 00:33:55.555
-Get her!
-Oh my God.

00:33:56.055 --> 00:33:58.558
No, don't! Stop it!

00:33:58.641 --> 00:33:59.809
What's wrong with you?

00:33:59.892 --> 00:34:00.810
Let her go!

00:34:01.978 --> 00:34:05.148
That's why I said
I didn't like kids your age.

00:34:34.719 --> 00:34:37.763
The police are focusing
on her motive and possible links,

00:34:37.847 --> 00:34:40.975
including her complex family background
and false identity,

00:34:41.058 --> 00:34:43.186
to uncover the truth behind this case.

00:34:58.284 --> 00:35:01.454
An Yun-su is currently on her way home
from the bakery.

00:35:01.537 --> 00:35:04.081
She still seems unaware
we found incriminating evidence,

00:35:04.165 --> 00:35:06.209
so we'll carry out the arrest
at her place.

00:35:06.292 --> 00:35:07.168
Hello, sir.

00:35:09.045 --> 00:35:10.463
Where's An's probation officer?

00:35:10.963 --> 00:35:12.423
She's on her way here.

00:35:14.884 --> 00:35:18.638
This is the requested log of her movement
for the day Ko Se-hun was killed.

00:35:21.474 --> 00:35:24.268
There's no record
of her going near the crime scene.

00:35:25.269 --> 00:35:28.189
The lines are only plotted
around the kindergarten and her home.

00:35:28.773 --> 00:35:29.607
Sorry I'm late.

00:35:30.191 --> 00:35:31.108
-Hello.
-You're here.

00:35:33.152 --> 00:35:35.154
Let me see An's records since her release.

00:35:37.573 --> 00:35:40.701
Pull up her full movement log
from the day of her release until now.

00:35:40.785 --> 00:35:41.911
Yes, ma'am.

00:35:47.833 --> 00:35:49.877
-Please zoom in on those lines.
-Yes, sir.

00:35:53.839 --> 00:35:57.134
On the 1st, 3rd, 4th,
and 6th of this month,

00:35:57.218 --> 00:35:58.719
she took this route.

00:36:01.931 --> 00:36:03.808
It matches Ko Se-hun's movements.

00:36:04.308 --> 00:36:07.478
She would've tailed him
to decide when and where to kill him.

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:10.564
Can you be certain

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:14.277
of An Yun-su's movements
on the day of the incident?

00:36:15.403 --> 00:36:16.654
Well,

00:36:17.571 --> 00:36:19.490
around 7:00 p.m. that evening,

00:36:19.573 --> 00:36:22.785
I received a call
saying her ankle monitor was broken,

00:36:22.868 --> 00:36:26.038
and I went to her house to replace it
about an hour later.

00:36:28.082 --> 00:36:29.208
Why are you

00:36:30.501 --> 00:36:32.086
only telling us this now?

00:36:32.586 --> 00:36:35.631
I didn't think
she could've done all that in an hour.

00:36:35.715 --> 00:36:38.092
It was pouring down,
and factoring in travel time--

00:36:38.175 --> 00:36:39.510
Who are you to make the call?

00:36:58.946 --> 00:37:02.241
Sop says she misses you,
so we're on our way there now.

00:37:15.838 --> 00:37:17.631
An Yun-su just got home.

00:37:17.715 --> 00:37:21.635
Keep it calm, and carefully approach her
to make the arrest.

00:37:22.136 --> 00:37:23.262
Yes, ma'am.

00:37:32.605 --> 00:37:33.439
Huh?

00:37:45.034 --> 00:37:45.910
Hey.

00:37:53.542 --> 00:37:55.503
You know who I am, don't you?

00:38:01.133 --> 00:38:03.511
Someone sent me this.

00:38:09.308 --> 00:38:10.684
Don't be afraid.

00:38:11.811 --> 00:38:14.021
I only came to hear the truth.

00:38:18.943 --> 00:38:20.569
Would you like to come in?

00:38:51.892 --> 00:38:53.561
Would you like a cup of tea?

00:38:54.395 --> 00:38:55.396
No, thank you.

00:38:56.772 --> 00:38:58.315
I think I'll have some.

00:39:07.658 --> 00:39:08.784
One day,

00:39:09.994 --> 00:39:13.539
I heard that my son and daughter-in-law
had been murdered.

00:39:14.748 --> 00:39:16.834
I spent my whole life as a soldier

00:39:18.377 --> 00:39:21.922
and never once said a kind word to my son.

00:39:23.507 --> 00:39:26.594
Even when he died, I couldn't cry.

00:39:31.348 --> 00:39:33.017
But yesterday,

00:39:34.351 --> 00:39:37.563
I found my grandson's body myself.

00:39:39.982 --> 00:39:41.734
Inside a cold freezer.

00:39:46.906 --> 00:39:49.950
Without knowing why this happened,

00:39:50.534 --> 00:39:52.286
I felt I couldn't die.

00:39:52.828 --> 00:39:54.121
That's why I'm here!

00:40:02.046 --> 00:40:03.214
Get off me!

00:40:05.049 --> 00:40:06.467
Get off!

00:41:12.032 --> 00:41:13.409
What bastard drives like…

00:41:13.909 --> 00:41:17.162
Wait. I think that's An Yun-su's car.

00:41:20.624 --> 00:41:22.626
-Well? Follow her!
-Yes, sir.

00:41:41.770 --> 00:41:42.771
It's okay.

00:41:43.397 --> 00:41:44.398
It's okay.

00:41:45.691 --> 00:41:46.859
It'll be okay.

00:41:47.610 --> 00:41:48.819
It's okay.

00:41:56.410 --> 00:41:59.455
NIGHT CURFEW VIOLATION

00:42:00.581 --> 00:42:03.292
Relay An Yun-su's location
to all police units!

00:42:14.970 --> 00:42:17.473
RETURN TO YOUR DESIGNATED AREA IMMEDIATELY

00:42:17.973 --> 00:42:20.142
CONTACT YOUR SUPERVISOR
TO CONFIRM THE VIOLATION

00:42:25.189 --> 00:42:28.359
PROBATION OFFICER BAE SUN-DEOK

00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:33.530
The person you're trying to reach
isn't available…

00:42:34.031 --> 00:42:35.699
Come on. Pick up.

00:42:37.951 --> 00:42:41.372
The number you have dialed is turned off.
You'll be directed to voicemail…

00:43:04.144 --> 00:43:06.063
HAIR FOUND AT KO'S MURDER SCENE

00:43:06.146 --> 00:43:08.190
IDENTIFIED AS FEMALE TEACHER A'S

00:44:13.964 --> 00:44:16.133
An just stopped at Haneul Mart
in Jungang-dong.

00:44:16.216 --> 00:44:18.177
-Go as fast as you can.
-Yes, ma'am.

00:44:34.318 --> 00:44:35.444
Come on, hurry.

00:45:00.969 --> 00:45:03.680
ELECTRONIC MONITORING SIGNAL LOST

00:45:08.685 --> 00:45:11.396
A sudden tightening
disrupted her circulation a bit.

00:45:23.367 --> 00:45:24.785
Thank you.

00:45:32.501 --> 00:45:36.797
You won't be seeing Inmate 407 again
until you get out of here.

00:45:38.590 --> 00:45:41.552
Don't worry. She's been moved
to a first-floor single cell.

00:46:12.291 --> 00:46:13.750
There's no need to be afraid.

00:46:14.251 --> 00:46:16.420
Consider this the safest place
you could be.

00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:26.555
NEW REVELATIONS IN KO'S MURDER CASE

00:46:26.638 --> 00:46:28.849
DEAL BETWEEN THE WITCH AND AN DISCOVERED

00:46:36.356 --> 00:46:39.985
-Doctor, could you turn the TV off?
-Sure.

00:46:40.068 --> 00:46:42.237
TAILED KO SE-HUN
REMOVED ANKLE TAG BEFORE MURDER

00:46:46.116 --> 00:46:48.619
I'll come with you
when you go back to the cell block.

00:46:48.702 --> 00:46:50.871
-There's an inmate who needs insulin.
-Okay.

00:47:00.839 --> 00:47:03.133
If you get anxious
or have trouble breathing again,

00:47:03.216 --> 00:47:05.177
don't hesitate to ask to come see me.

00:47:06.261 --> 00:47:07.930
This is my stop.

00:47:44.466 --> 00:47:47.844
Hey, it's Ms. Eom. Be quiet. Put it away.

00:47:49.262 --> 00:47:50.263
What's going on?

00:47:51.348 --> 00:47:52.641
We're busted.

00:47:54.893 --> 00:47:56.478
Inmate 7137, get out here.

00:48:00.857 --> 00:48:02.109
What are you doing?

00:48:02.192 --> 00:48:03.193
My apologies.

00:48:03.735 --> 00:48:05.570
How many times have I warned you?

00:48:06.613 --> 00:48:07.447
Also,

00:48:08.365 --> 00:48:10.283
eating is prohibited after lights out.

00:48:13.912 --> 00:48:15.956
Ms. Eom, what is she doing?

00:48:28.218 --> 00:48:29.594
No!

00:48:39.646 --> 00:48:40.480
No.

00:48:42.858 --> 00:48:43.692
No!

00:48:46.653 --> 00:48:47.821
No!

00:53:20.093 --> 00:53:25.098
