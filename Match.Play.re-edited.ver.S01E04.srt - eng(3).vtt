WEBVTT

00:00:00.583 --> 00:00:02.167
What was that about?

00:00:04.083 --> 00:00:06.375
I'll get back to you later.

00:00:07.958 --> 00:00:09.417
What's that supposed to mean?

00:00:10.167 --> 00:00:12.792
This has nothing to do with Mr. Moon Do-ha.

00:00:13.167 --> 00:00:15.601
It's Shin Jun-oh's business. What do
you mean it has nothing to do with me?

00:00:15.625 --> 00:00:17.125
Of course it does.

00:00:18.417 --> 00:00:19.917
Why?

00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:23.500
Are you afraid I'll go kiss
up to Mr. Shin Jun-oh?

00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:30.000
Our stunt team never kiss up to actors.

00:00:31.417 --> 00:00:35.208
Besides, if that's what
you think, Mr. Moon Do-ha,

00:00:36.542 --> 00:00:37.958
then I'm truly disappointed.

00:00:41.083 --> 00:00:42.625
That's all.

00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:56.583
Mr. Gu Jae-yeon, I need to talk to you.

00:00:56.917 --> 00:00:59.167
Yes, what is it?

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:00.708
Um...

00:01:00.833 --> 00:01:02.292
It's something a little personal.

00:01:02.417 --> 00:01:04.667
Can we talk over there for a second?

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.125
We can talk later, then.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.000
Mr. Gu Jae-yeon!

00:01:09.125 --> 00:01:10.375
Mr. Gu Jae-yeon!

00:01:12.167 --> 00:01:13.625
Mr. Gu Jae-yeon.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:14.500
Please check this.

00:01:14.625 --> 00:01:17.333
I ordered something
delicious. Want to join me?

00:01:17.458 --> 00:01:20.375
Thanks, but I'm going to eat with my team.

00:01:21.167 --> 00:01:22.250
Enjoy your meal.

00:01:28.583 --> 00:01:30.333
What's with Gu Jae-yeon?

00:01:31.375 --> 00:01:33.208
He can't even spare a minute to talk?

00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:35.917
If this keeps up,
what if I can't focus and get hurt?

00:01:36.042 --> 00:01:37.375
Will he take responsibility?

00:01:38.792 --> 00:01:39.792
Well...

00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:44.500
Jae-yeon has... a lot of
team members to look after.

00:01:44.625 --> 00:01:45.625
Team members...

00:01:48.292 --> 00:01:50.458
You two have a fight scene to shoot later.

00:01:50.583 --> 00:01:52.625
Can't you talk then?

00:01:52.875 --> 00:01:54.917
Yes, prepare to shoot. Stand by.

00:01:55.042 --> 00:01:57.000
Okay, let's get ready. Stand by.

00:01:57.125 --> 00:01:58.583
- Camera?
- Rolling.

00:01:58.708 --> 00:01:59.458
Sound?

00:01:59.583 --> 00:02:00.958
Speed.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:02.917
Ready...

00:02:03.042 --> 00:02:04.333
Action!

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.042
Mr. Gu Jae-yeon.

00:02:19.708 --> 00:02:21.208
Want to make a bet with me?

00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:24.208
No thanks. Please focus.

00:02:24.333 --> 00:02:26.208
You'll get hurt if you're distracted.

00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.292
This scene.

00:02:30.417 --> 00:02:32.250
If I get through it
without a single mistake,

00:02:32.375 --> 00:02:33.958
I win.

00:02:34.667 --> 00:02:35.958
Deal?

00:02:44.083 --> 00:02:45.625
Cut! Okay.

00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.458
How did you know?

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.958
How did I know what?

00:03:09.792 --> 00:03:11.059
The way you came at me so recklessly,

00:03:11.083 --> 00:03:12.583
it's no surprise you got hurt.

00:03:15.458 --> 00:03:17.125
So, does that mean I lose?

00:03:20.125 --> 00:03:21.458
The bet.

00:03:22.042 --> 00:03:23.833
Is that really important right now?

00:03:26.542 --> 00:03:28.292
I was going to make you grant me a wish...

00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:31.000
Are you even listening to me?

00:03:31.833 --> 00:03:35.353
How could you expect to get through that
unscathed with something like that on your mind?

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.250
So you don't want to talk to me anymore?

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.875
If you mean talking,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.875
aren't we doing that right now?

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.583
Not like this.

00:03:53.917 --> 00:03:56.542
I mean, like, getting closer. You know?

00:04:04.667 --> 00:04:06.042
Mr. Moon Do-ha.

00:04:07.333 --> 00:04:09.250
Do you want to get closer to me?

00:04:09.375 --> 00:04:10.625
Well...

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.583
Why?

00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.125
Do we have a show to appear on together?

00:04:20.917 --> 00:04:22.583
What are you talking about?

00:04:22.708 --> 00:04:24.208
It's nothing like that.

00:04:24.333 --> 00:04:26.917
Then... movie promotion?

00:04:27.042 --> 00:04:28.708
No.

00:04:28.833 --> 00:04:30.708
I said it's not like that.

00:04:32.292 --> 00:04:34.083
I don't know either.

00:04:35.208 --> 00:04:36.792
But.

00:04:37.667 --> 00:04:39.333
I'm sure of this much.

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.917
We're closer than you
and Shin Jun-oh, right?

00:04:48.417 --> 00:04:49.500
Right?

00:04:50.417 --> 00:04:52.917
We're closer than you and Shin Jun-oh!

00:04:53.042 --> 00:04:54.750
Why aren't you answering?

00:05:01.125 --> 00:05:02.500
Moon Do-ha.

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:04.750
Huh?

00:05:04.875 --> 00:05:06.458
Are you a child?

00:05:19.542 --> 00:05:20.542
Where's Jae-yeon?

00:05:20.583 --> 00:05:22.042
With Moon Do-ha.

00:05:22.542 --> 00:05:23.542
Moon Do-ha?

00:05:23.667 --> 00:05:25.333
Yeah, probably went to see Moon Do-ha.

00:05:25.458 --> 00:05:28.000
Are those two on good terms or not?

00:05:28.125 --> 00:05:29.708
Hey, what do you think?

00:05:31.458 --> 00:05:33.167
More good than bad.

00:05:33.292 --> 00:05:34.958
But there are a lot of bad times too.

00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.417
Mr. Moon Do-ha.

00:05:43.583 --> 00:05:45.958
Let's get something straight.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.167
I've felt this since we first met.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.708
Why do you always talk like that?

00:05:56.792 --> 00:06:01.167
That whole 'reputation' thing...
Is that your idea of 'sucking up'?

00:06:03.208 --> 00:06:04.768
There are things you can
say and things you can't.

00:06:04.792 --> 00:06:06.750
Don't you know where to draw the line?

00:06:07.458 --> 00:06:09.958
Or is that what you really
think, Mr. Moon Do-ha?

00:06:11.125 --> 00:06:12.500
No.

00:06:13.458 --> 00:06:15.417
What was that? I can't hear you.

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:16.833
No.

00:06:21.167 --> 00:06:23.208
I went too far. I'm sorry.

00:06:28.875 --> 00:06:30.309
Before, I thought once the job was over,

00:06:30.333 --> 00:06:32.833
we wouldn't see each
other again, so I let it go.

00:06:33.917 --> 00:06:35.833
But I won't let it slide anymore.

00:06:37.375 --> 00:06:38.958
Please watch what you say.

00:06:39.083 --> 00:06:40.333
Yes.

00:06:42.125 --> 00:06:43.750
Hey, I'm talking to you seriously.

00:06:43.875 --> 00:06:45.125
Yes!

00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:58.625
When you throw a hook, make it wider.

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.625
Hook! Bigger movements.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.167
Got it?

00:07:03.292 --> 00:07:04.768
- Mr. Gu Jae-yeon!
- There he goes again.

00:07:04.792 --> 00:07:06.125
Mr. Gu Jae-yeon!

00:07:06.792 --> 00:07:07.583
Mr. Gu Jae-yeon.

00:07:07.708 --> 00:07:09.167
Did you see me on the wire?

00:07:09.292 --> 00:07:11.172
Of course I did. I'm the
one who harnessed you.

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:13.976
I just came from watching the monitor.
Do you know how great it looked?

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.250
- Yeah.
- And the script supervisor said...

00:07:16.375 --> 00:07:17.708
the wide shot looked amazing too.

00:07:17.833 --> 00:07:19.851
You always say to make the
movements bigger, right, Mr. Gu Jae-yeon?

00:07:19.875 --> 00:07:21.542
- So...
- Mr. Do-ha, please wait a moment.

00:07:21.667 --> 00:07:22.667
Yes!

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.000
I'll be right back.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:27.292
Hey.

00:07:28.792 --> 00:07:30.208
Are your ears bleeding yet?

00:07:30.792 --> 00:07:32.167
Oh, not yet.

00:07:33.583 --> 00:07:35.250
I can't figure you two out.

00:07:49.292 --> 00:07:51.000
Are you happy leaving me behind?

00:07:52.083 --> 00:07:54.523
Anyone who didn't know better
would think I'm abandoning you.

00:07:54.625 --> 00:07:57.000
My scenes are all done.
What do you want me to do?

00:08:04.167 --> 00:08:05.458
Still,

00:08:05.583 --> 00:08:07.101
since there are no action scenes left,

00:08:07.125 --> 00:08:09.285
at least I don't have to
worry about you getting hurt.

00:08:10.625 --> 00:08:12.875
- But don't let your guard down.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.167
Don't get sick, don't get hurt.

00:08:15.292 --> 00:08:16.917
I know that already.

00:08:17.417 --> 00:08:19.417
Do you know how much my contract is worth?

00:08:19.542 --> 00:08:21.083
I don't know anything about that.

00:08:21.208 --> 00:08:23.968
All I know is that if you get hurt,
you're the only one who loses out.

00:08:24.833 --> 00:08:26.083
Ah.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.042
Good luck with the rest of the shoot.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.542
I have next week off.

00:08:43.083 --> 00:08:44.417
Huh?

00:08:45.792 --> 00:08:47.458
It's a day off next week.

00:08:51.625 --> 00:08:52.875
Right.

00:08:53.917 --> 00:08:55.375
So?

00:09:00.208 --> 00:09:02.208
One, two, three, four...

00:09:02.333 --> 00:09:03.917
Five, six, seven...

00:09:04.042 --> 00:09:05.167
Six...

00:09:05.292 --> 00:09:07.083
One, two, three...

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:09.792
Another killer workout.

00:09:11.042 --> 00:09:12.875
I heard Moon Do-ha finished filming.

00:09:13.125 --> 00:09:15.333
What, you miss him?

00:09:15.458 --> 00:09:16.917
No.

00:09:17.833 --> 00:09:19.458
That was a quick answer.

00:09:20.292 --> 00:09:22.768
Just say so if you want to see him.
Moon Do-ha is going back to Seoul today.

00:09:22.792 --> 00:09:23.583
What?

00:09:23.708 --> 00:09:25.792
Isn't Moon Do-ha filming right now?

00:09:26.083 --> 00:09:28.625
He is, but today is a day off.

00:09:29.833 --> 00:09:31.417
You two are still seeing each other?

00:09:32.833 --> 00:09:34.333
Yeah.

00:09:43.208 --> 00:09:44.833
Oh, Gu Jae-yeon.

00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:45.708
Yes, Director.

00:09:45.833 --> 00:09:47.375
Are you free tonight?

00:09:47.917 --> 00:09:49.750
You've got to be kidding me.

00:09:49.875 --> 00:09:52.042
I just got the call myself.

00:09:52.167 --> 00:09:53.708
That guy is unbelievable!

00:09:53.833 --> 00:09:55.684
What's with him throwing an
apology dinner now, of all times?

00:09:55.708 --> 00:09:57.375
And on such short notice?

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.625
Shin Jun-oh said he's only free today.

00:10:01.208 --> 00:10:03.292
So what? Same here!

00:10:03.875 --> 00:10:07.000
I already told the director I had plans.

00:10:07.125 --> 00:10:08.583
You told him but...

00:10:11.125 --> 00:10:11.958
Mr. Moon Do-ha.

00:10:12.083 --> 00:10:12.958
I don't want to.

00:10:13.083 --> 00:10:14.083
Mr. Moon Do-ha!

00:10:14.208 --> 00:10:16.083
Did you say no?

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:17.792
Manager.

00:10:17.917 --> 00:10:18.625
It's been a while.

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:19.917
How have you been?

00:10:20.042 --> 00:10:21.522
Mr. Shin Jun-oh will head over first.

00:10:21.583 --> 00:10:22.458
Yes, understood.

00:10:22.583 --> 00:10:23.583
Mr. Jae-yeon.

00:10:23.667 --> 00:10:24.851
We've all been following
you. We're big fans.

00:10:24.875 --> 00:10:25.875
Our rising star.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.458
- Shall we head over there?
- Yes, please.

00:10:35.667 --> 00:10:37.292
I already said I didn't want [you] to...

00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:43.250
Stocks, commercials, investments...

00:10:48.583 --> 00:10:50.208
Mr. Shin can really hold his liquor.

00:10:50.333 --> 00:10:51.083
This way, this way...

00:10:51.208 --> 00:10:52.208
I'm getting drunk.

00:10:52.792 --> 00:10:54.625
There's a step here, please be careful.

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:01.208
Director, please have some water.

00:11:01.333 --> 00:11:02.375
Thanks.

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:04.625
Hey, I can... handle myself now.

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:05.917
You can go.

00:11:06.333 --> 00:11:07.750
Don't you have plans?

00:11:08.333 --> 00:11:10.000
I already canceled them.

00:11:10.125 --> 00:11:12.458
Should I get you something for hangover?

00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.125
You weren't planning
on going later, were you?

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:18.250
Earlier... I saw you weren't drinking.

00:11:18.375 --> 00:11:19.500
Hey, you can go.

00:11:27.042 --> 00:11:28.875
Why don't you just focus on your planks!

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:36.708
Huh?

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:43.833
What is this?

00:11:44.542 --> 00:11:46.000
You're actually here?

00:11:46.125 --> 00:11:48.542
What, did you think I was kidding?

00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.208
No, it's not...

00:11:50.333 --> 00:11:51.750
That's not what I meant.

00:11:54.833 --> 00:11:56.500
It's your rare day off.

00:11:56.625 --> 00:11:59.625
It would be a shame if I made you
cancel our plans.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:01.583
Did you have somewhere you wanted to go?

00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.500
And you called me the workout addict...

00:12:18.667 --> 00:12:20.875
Have you been here with anyone before?

00:12:23.083 --> 00:12:25.042
With a girlfriend.

00:12:25.583 --> 00:12:27.208
A girlfriend...

00:12:28.458 --> 00:12:30.333
You bring a girlfriend
to a place like this?

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:35.667
I'm sorry about
canceling our plans earlier.

00:12:37.042 --> 00:12:38.083
Later...

00:12:38.208 --> 00:12:40.042
I'll take you home.

00:12:40.167 --> 00:12:42.208
I ask for your understanding.

00:12:44.833 --> 00:12:46.083
Mr. Moon Do-ha?

00:12:52.167 --> 00:12:54.000
I've been thinking.

00:12:55.042 --> 00:12:56.792
Isn't this a date?

00:12:58.042 --> 00:12:59.417
A date... what?

00:12:59.542 --> 00:13:04.000
I pick you up before dawn, watch
over you, then take you home.

00:13:04.125 --> 00:13:05.625
That's a textbook date, isn't it?

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:07.042
Oh...

00:13:07.167 --> 00:13:09.042
I guess you could see it that way.

00:13:09.917 --> 00:13:11.708
Although we're not [dating].

00:13:15.917 --> 00:13:17.708
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:13:22.292 --> 00:13:24.750
I'm not sure what this feeling is.

00:13:28.792 --> 00:13:30.292
So...

00:13:32.833 --> 00:13:34.375
Next time...

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.208
Do you want to go on a date with me?

00:13:37.417 --> 00:13:39.250
