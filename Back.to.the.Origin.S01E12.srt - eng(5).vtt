00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.800
Today, I'm thrilled

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.520
to introduce my dog Naonao to you!

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.120
He's a good boy.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.640
Come on. Handshake.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.360
Give me your hand.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.720
Handshake.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:50.640
Come on. Handshake.

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:53.400
Handshake, Naonao.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.920
Another cute thing

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.520
about Naonao is...

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.320
Thanks to your Naonao.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.920
He's very smart.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.760
Ran told me he's very cooperative.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.160
Sit.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.639
Come here.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:11.680
Sit.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.800
Be quiet. Sit.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.600
Naonao, sit.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.600
Didn't she work

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.640
as a TV host?

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.079
Why did she start live-streaming?

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.960
We don't understand

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.880
young people these days.

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:27.600
Guys,

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.480
mark my words.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.720
Choice matters more than effort.

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:31.560
Do you think the winners

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.800
are all-around geniuses?

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.160
No!

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.640
Most of them are people

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.880
who dare to take a chance.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.000
I have a friend named Yuan,

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.960
who was

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.079
a nobody

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:43.680
in the workplace.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.280
No, that's not the line.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.880
But,

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.320
she strove

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.360
to be

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.280
the best...

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.120
[Handshake.]

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.040
[Sit.]

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.480
Naonao, sit.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.760
Naonao, sit.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.400
Naonao, sit.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.760
Stop.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.800
Sit.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.360
Handshake.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.720
Handshake.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.040
Handshake.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.880
Handshake.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.920
Good boy.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.120
You can do it.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.360
You can do it.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.960
But it's useless.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.520
Nobody wants to watch you do this.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.000
They want to see the dog.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.440
So she went from rags to riches.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.040
The conclusion

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.640
is

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.079
the course of one's life

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.680
has little to do with

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.960
his personal ability.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.560
Go to sleep already.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.760
What?

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.160
What animal do they

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.360
want you to show now?

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.440
Handshake.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.240
Sit.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.640
Good boy.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.960
[Can't you just be human?]

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.640
Stand. Sit. Up.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.680
You're acting weird.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.880
Yudong, I'm screwed.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.920
The video views just won't increase.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:14.680
How about this?

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:16.600
You raise a pig

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:19.399
and teach it to sit.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.760
Sit.

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:22.200
It learns.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.120
Handshake.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.960
It learns.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.160
- Then you're the master.
- Good boy.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.680
Time out.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.480
I quit.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.600
Sleep time.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.920
Yeah.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.080
Let me tell you,

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.960
the ginkgo in Canada

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.400
is particularly pure.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.159
It's good for your brain,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.880
said Xinying.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.080
Eat as soon as possible,

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.840
and it will benefit

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.080
your health in the future.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.000
Have you had it yet?

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.560
It's still a bit early for me.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.400
You're so confident.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.680
Aiying,

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.040
check this out.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.680
I can check it when we get home.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.600
It's time to cook.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.320
Just have a look at it.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.200
Isn't it embarrassing?

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.000
Morning.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.760
Ran has

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.400
received a higher education.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.200
She used to work

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.159
as a TV host.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.120
What on earth is she doing now?

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.040
She must have

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.480
her reasons for doing it.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.200
What kind of reason is that?

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.680
Do you remember

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.120
what she told us before?

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.360
She said

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.040
she was enjoying the life in Canada.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.320
But actually, she worked as a personal shopper.

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:11.920
Well, there's

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.320
no shame in returning home

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.520
if she's not doing well abroad.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.640
She can find a steady job here,

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.440
right?

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.480
At least it'd be decent.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.200
Lu Ming has

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.720
connections.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.160
If she asks,

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.280
her uncle-in-law will definitely help.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.360
What is she doing now?

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:31.920
Playing dumb?

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:33.920
You're going too far.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.760
How can you say she's playing dumb?

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.920
You think it's easy

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.200
that everyone can do that?

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.480
At least the advertisers buy it.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.240
Seriously!

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.080
She earns her living through honest labor.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.120
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.480
You are being unfair.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.200
Don't

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.400
judge her

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.080
with your

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.960
bourgeois mindset!

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:52.960
Unbelievable!

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.120
I just don't care for your nonsense.

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:56.680
You're going too far.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.000
Don't just leave!

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.760
My phone!

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.000
What's the big deal?

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:06.800
Just leave.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:07.640
Take this away.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:08.120
I don't want it.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:08.840
Your brain needs it

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:09.720
more than mine.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.360
What do you mean?

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.080
Every time I go to the market,

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.480
I have to avoid Daddy Liu. As soon as he

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.680
spots me from afar, he calls out

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.360
to me, wanting to give me gifts.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.400
I feel so embarrassed.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.440
It's just that

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.080
their kid Liu Bo works for Ran.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:28.960
No need to thank me.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:29.720
Okay.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.400
Is Liu Bo doing well?

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:32.720
Yeah.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:37.320
This soup

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.080
looks

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.560
very well-made.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.560
Ran, I'll get you some.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:56.640
I saw it.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:57.640
I'm working on it.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.760
Don't give me soup. I'll skip it.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.400
Honey, check this.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.080
Look.

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.360
I followed him,

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.240
and he followed back.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.680
But why aren't we mutuals?

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.080
Did he unfollow you?

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:12.920
Why did he unfollow me?

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.080
He's just followed me!

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:14.600
Why?

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.040
He only followed me for a second!

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.200
Don't check your phone while eating.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:26.320
Bo.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.640
How did the Commerce reply?

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:28.680
Will he assign work to us?

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:29.480
What did he say?

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.520
[Ran, Mr. Liu from Commerce]

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.000
[said the ROAS of your]

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.480
[latest ads weren't so good.]

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:36.960
[The clients weren't happy about them.]

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:41.200
How could he say that?

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.360
Did you show him our data?

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.360
Did he see it clearly?

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:44.280
Zhang Ran,

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.200
I'm talking to you.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.760
Don't check your phone while eating.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.560
Mom, I'm working.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.320
So what?

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.400
I've worked for 40 years

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.600
and never acted like this.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.120
You think you're so great?

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.000
I brought you

00:08:59.000 --> 00:08:59.840
into this world.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.280
Not this again, will you?

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.160
Yeah, you brought this

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.480
eight-pound infant here, but it doesn't

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.080
mean you can

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:05.960
control her forever.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:06.920
I've made it perfectly clear.

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.880
I'm not playing. I'm working.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.440
Please be more understanding.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:11.640
Eight pounds at birth?

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.360
You were so heavy.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.240
Thank you, mom.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.000
I can't understand.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.920
Are you the President?

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:18.880
Does the world come to a standstill

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:19.800
during a twenty-minute

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.360
lunch break without your phone?

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.320
Am I wrong to tell you

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.400
to focus on eating?

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.480
Being right doesn't mean you have to do it.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:28.400
What?

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.080
Who am I?

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.000
What am I to you?

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.720
Your nanny or your assistant?

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.600
I put so much effort into preparing this meal.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.000
For such a long time,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.280
I've provided you with room and board.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.520
Now you're blaming me?

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.720
Alright, it's all my fault.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.000
Out of sight, out of mind.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.400
I'm going out to work.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:46.640
You just can't stop

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:47.600
complaining about

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.160
my things.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:48.920
Mom, don't get mad.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:49.440
I'll talk to her.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.800
How could you talk to mom like that?

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:54.240
She's my mom!

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:56.800
She uses her phone to work.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:57.840
What's your reason

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.520
staring at your phone while eating?

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.040
That's enough.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.760
You're going too far.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:03.760
No one listens

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:04.520
to me anyway,

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.680
including you.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.120
No one!

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:15.720
We should now rent a place

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.240
and move out.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:16.760
I can't stand it.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:18.480
I did the math.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.720
If we withdraw the money from the bank

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.000
in Canada and exchange it for RMB,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.760
it should be enough to keep us going for a while.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:27.880
I'm fine with it.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.840
It's just that a short-term lease

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:30.640
for only a few months

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:32.720
can be hard to come by.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:34.960
Anyway, we

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.200
agreed to give it a try

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:37.960
for a year back here.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.360
We can still head back to Canada.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.120
We can just talk it over

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.480
with the landlord

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.360
about the lease.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.480
I don't see the problem.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.000
Do you remember?

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.680
I said you're different from before.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:55.960
I don't know whether

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:57.840
it was

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.000
after you met Yuan Yuan

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.080
or after you returned China.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:01.040
Now, you're like

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.720
a fish that's taken the bait.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.200
You won't let go

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.360
for just a little bait.

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.200
I know you signed

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:14.880
a three-year contract.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:17.600
I saw it.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:20.720
When did you see it?

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.160
Why didn't you tell me?

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:24.120
No wonder

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.280
you've been

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.520
sarcastic with me lately.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.040
I never wanted a long contract.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:28.840
I only found out

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:30.440
after I returned that I had to sign it.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.360
It is a three-year

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:32.000
development

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.080
program.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.640
I'm under so much pressure.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:35.640
I've swallowed my pride,

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:36.520
but the results

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:37.200
are still terrible.

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:38.920
Everyone is pressuring me,

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:39.960
and you're

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.160
no better than them.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.360
I know how much

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:43.120
you value this job.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.240
You don't. You know nothing.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.520
I never meant to pressure you

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:46.560
to go back to Canada, okay?

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:47.480
Then what do you mean?

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.080
I just think that

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.520
no matter what you're thinking,

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:53.560
you can discuss it with me.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:54.520
If you ask,

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:55.520
I'll give it all

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:56.520
just for you.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:57.480
I'm always here.

00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.600
But you must believe me.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:00.760
You can't keep

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:01.840
hiding things from me.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.160
Then you should ask me

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:04.120
to tell you everything.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:04.840
You can't just

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.080
beat about the bush.

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:08.920
I thought

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.040
you'd refuse to tell me.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:12.880
I just don't know how to tell you.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:17.160
Anyway,

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.160
I stop agonizing over it.

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:20.440
If you decide

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.360
to strive for your career,

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.080
I will definitely support you

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:24.320
wholeheartedly.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.160
That's true.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:27.400
From the day

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.720
I decided to return China with you,

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.360
I made up my mind.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:32.840
As long as I can be with you,

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:34.840
whether you want to be

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:35.520
an internet

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:36.520
celebrity in China

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:37.280
or on Mars,

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:38.080
I'll be right there.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:43.680
Do you really think so?

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:46.200
Yes.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:48.960
You should have said that earlier.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.880
I was acting like a mad dog.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:52.880
Did you just want to see me like that?

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.160
You just wanted to see it.

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:55.120
I'm sorry.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:56.640
It's my fault.

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.120
How could you be wrong?

00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.480
Aren't you the best person?

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.280
What?

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:02.960
What are you spacing out for?

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:07.800
Are we still

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:08.560
renting a place?

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:12.280
You're the boss.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.440
Don't be so clingy like

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.280
a piece of gum.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:16.600
What?

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.160
You're a piece of soft tofu.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:20.800
I'm warm as soy milk.

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.480
You're soy pulp.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:25.800
So annoying.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:47.640
You didn't tell me

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.280
if you are happy

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:52.840
after you came back.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:53.840
As long as you're happy.

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:03.040
Isn't my

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.240
own clothing just fine?

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.960
Why do I have to dress like this?

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.080
Alright. It fits you pretty well.

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:11.400
We're going to meet with the investor.

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:12.480
Your clothes

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.000
are only fine for flea markets.

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:17.480
Do you know who Xing Kai is?

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.080
Never heard of him.

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.000
He invests in the Spring of Green

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.040
and the Highlight.

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:22.480
Did

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.200
you even read the files I gave you?

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:25.960
Is that

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:26.600
"Three-Year IPO"

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.160
and "The Miracle of Domestic Brands"?

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:30.880
Take it.

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:31.680
What is it?

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:32.520
I prepared it for you.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:33.520
Let's go.

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.800
Where did you get that photo?

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:36.760
It's so ugly!

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:37.720
I edited it.

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:40.760
Yudong, do you have gum?

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:43.160
No,

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:44.120
I don't have bad breath.

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.120
Why? Did you fart?

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:53.920
Cheng Man

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.000
put some imported cheese

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:57.720
she

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:58.760
bought a couple

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:00.120
days ago into my lunch

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:00.840
salad.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:01.720
My mouth smells

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:02.760
like stinky socks now.

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:04.760
Come smell it.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:06.480
Can you smell it?

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:07.520
No.

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:08.120
Really?

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:08.520
Really.

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:09.040
Then don't avoid.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.160
It's fine?

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:12.320
You have salad for lunch?

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.320
Cheng Man told me

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:18.800
that Carbohydrates can trigger

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.520
inflammation.

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:23.560
See?

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:24.720
This is called

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:25.920
scientific feeding.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.840
Good. You had too much meat.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.320
Occasional salad is good for you.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.720
Only when it's occasional.

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:37.120
I now need to eat salad

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.040
for lunch every day,

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.400
which adds up to 3650 meals a decade.

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:41.520
That's not occasional.

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:44.320
A decade.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:45.040
As if you eat

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.200
at home every single day.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.440
It's still over 2000

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:50.840
even after subtracting.

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:55.080
Do you know what kind

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.520
of sound I make when I snore?

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:03.640
Talk less.

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:04.599
What?

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:05.800
Why do you keep fanning?

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:06.800
It's hot here.

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:08.119
Does it really stink?

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:09.119
No.

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:09.680
Really?

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:10.359
Really.

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:12.160
Really?

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.160
I don't lie to you.

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:37.280
Let's leave.

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:39.200
Don't rush.

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:42.440
I feel like Xing Kai

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:44.080
is about to meet with us.

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:45.840
You said that

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:47.160
three hours ago.

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:48.880
This is a kind of contest.

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:52.520
He is testing our patience.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.640
Just a moment more.

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.360
I can feel it.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:17:59.000
Almost there.

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.160
He's about to give in.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.280
You're like an old turtle.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:08.880
I've turned it

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:09.880
countless times.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:11.680
We'll wait for one

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:13.160
last round. If he doesn't come,

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:15.120
the fool will stay.

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:19.320
You said the same thing

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.720
when you turned it last time.

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:21.440
No.

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:22.280
I said, a fool

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.600
like you will stay.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:29.920
Where are his manners?

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:30.480
How could he

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:31.680
keep people waiting so long?

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:34.360
Dr. Fu.

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.160
You got

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.040
your doctoral diploma

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:40.400
in 2013.

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:45.560
Graduated at twenty-eight?

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:46.840
You're amazing!

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:49.320
I was in a combined master's

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.880
and doctoral program, so I finished faster.

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.640
You're something else!

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.880
So, for past ten years since graduation,

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:01.120
have you been pursuing scholarship?

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:03.840
You don't have

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:05.920
any work experiences

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:06.800
after graduation?

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:12.880
It's complicated...

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:16.840
For the past ten years,

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.240
I've been taking care

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:19.280
of my family.

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.320
I wasn't working.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.160
Taking care of the family?

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.760
What a model for men in the new era!

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:29.040
You're a great man!

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.400
My wife used to be

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:32.920
a TV host.

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:34.520
She has hosted

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:35.520
the financial program,

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.080
Today's Financial Interview.

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:37.920
Do you know it?

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.040
Of course.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:40.600
I was even on that show.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.640
I know the host.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:44.400
It's Yuan Yuan, right?

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:45.800
Is she your wife?

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:49.240
I thought she married to a venture capitalist.

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.040
No.

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.240
It's the previous host.

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:55.520
Lin Fei?

00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:59.600
It's Zhang Ran.

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:02.800
The Ran for rising sun.

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.400
What a beautiful view you have here!

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:11.240
Yeah.

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:13.920
Dr. Fu is in charge

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.680
of the technology for our project,

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:16.880
so you have

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.000
absolutely

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.880
nothing to worry about.

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:22.280
Alright.

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:24.920
Well, I'll

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.480
speak plainly then.

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:27.480
Please.

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:29.040
To be honest,

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.840
my interest lies

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:33.080
not in this project

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:35.360
but

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.320
in Dr. Fu himself.

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:41.560
Dr. Fu,

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.760
if you're interested,

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:45.720
you're welcome to join our company.

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:48.000
Zhang Ran.

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:49.640
The company

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:50.800
will suspend

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.800
all your business activities.

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:55.320
Your last ad

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.200
barely got 100 likes.

00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:59.160
We can't accept it.

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:01.400
I see.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.320
Zhang Ran.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.480
People's interest

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:04.880
in your image as a Desperate Personal Shopper

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:06.800
has gradually waned.

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.320
I think you need to

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:15.120
find a new way forward.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:15.920
Right?

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.200
I believe you can do it.

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:18.680
You need to work harder to

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:20.320
find a breakthrough point.

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:21.360
Content is king

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:22.640
in our industry.

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.520
If you still can't find a new way out,

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:25.440
the company

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:26.480
won't provide you

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:27.440
with any more resources.

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:29.600
Okay.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:36.600
Zhang Ran.

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:39.080
I've seen so many streamers.

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:42.480
I really

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:44.920
care about you.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.280
I went through all that trouble,

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:51.320
messaging

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:52.280
and calling you constantly,

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:53.440
getting you here

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.080
from Canada.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.840
I truly believed in you.

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.280
But the moment I saw you,

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:01.120
I knew.

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:03.240
You think little

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.480
of this line of work.

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:10.080
Ms. Qian, to be honest,

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.080
it's not that I look down on it.

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:14.560
I just don't know much about it,

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:16.040
and I don't really get it.

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.480
To this day, I still don't.

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:19.360
I'm still grateful

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:21.360
you kept reaching out,

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.720
calling and texting

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:23.880
to bring me in.

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:24.440
If I had

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:25.640
delivered some good results by now,

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:28.160
I bet this whole conversation

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:29.200
would feel different.

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:29.800
It's just because...

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.120
Then you have to put in the effort.

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.160
I've tried everything.

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:35.680
I even stuffed my face

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:37.640
on camera.

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:39.200
I played with puppies,

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.120
tried being a pet blogger.

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:41.480
I tried it all.

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:42.920
It's just a mystery.

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:44.040
I just can't wrap my head

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:45.680
around how traffic works.

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:48.000
Zhang Ran, it's not a mystery.

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:49.960
We can help you with many things.

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:50.640
But for the rest,

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.320
you've gotta figure it out yourself.

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:54.680
I understand.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:55.840
Really.

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.160
I understand your position too.

00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:58.840
The company

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:00.600
has so many creators

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:01.240
here.

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:03.040
It's like casting a wide net.

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:04.160
Naturally, you'd focus

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.280
on cultivating the ones

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:06.080
who are lively and active, right?

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.440
The rest sink to the bottom.

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.160
That's perfectly normal.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.440
That's just how the world is.

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:11.720
That's the pattern.

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:12.480
I got it.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.320
I understand.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:15.920
My husband once told me,

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.720
"Quit and problem solved."

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:21.920
Maybe it's just not in me.

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:24.240
Maybe I should just quit.

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:04.960
Fu Yudong.

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:11.480
Should we get

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.000
blackout curtains?

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:24.360
Whatever you say.

[Ran,]

You guys go ahead.

00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:59.080
I'm not hungry. I'm working.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.760
[Alright, alright.]

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:06.600
Hey, Bo.

Hey, Ran.

Three days down

of a great week.

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:14.320
Let's post something.

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:17.000
More posts, fewer followers.

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:18.400
Better stay home and play dead.

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.480
[Don't worry.]

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:22.040

Isn't that my level exactly?

Never done live sales. I don't know how.

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:40.440
Ran,

we're not selling tickets.

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.120
We're just creating buzz.

Okay?

Please,

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.120
do it for me.

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:56.320
[And for my year-end bonus.]

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.000
Wait, I thought it was voluntary?

00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.760
[I already signed you up.]

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:01.680
You...

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.400
The company

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:05.840
will be monitoring

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:07.080
the traffic in the live rooms.

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:08.600
If you can make it into the top five,

[Come on.]

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.160
[An amusement park. Think of it as fun.]

[I heard from Ms. Dai]

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:36.160
[in Planning]

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:37.160

[Bye.]

About the

Sorry.

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:27.840
I'll follow you, alright?

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:28.800
[Nezha's not bad.]

[She knows how to pick her spot.]

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:30.960

looks great!

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.440
Ms. Qian, the live viewer count

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:37.720
is holding steady at 320.

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:38.200
About

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:39.120
what we expected.

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:40.720
Let me check.

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:42.760
This is it.

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:50.320
This is Zhang Ran.

[So the carousel]

[The ride I'm on]

[merry-go-round.]

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:00.320
The rule is

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:01.800
you have to

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:03.120
be 1.2 meters tall

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:04.440

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:06.080
Yep, 1.2 meters.

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:07.920
Look at all the kids around me...

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.480
Hey, are you 1.2 meters tall?

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:13.280
None of your business.

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:18.680
Me?

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.040
I'm the "Desperate Personal Shopper".

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:25.840
Why isn't she replying

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:27.560
to that comment?

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:29.400
How is she going to boost traffic?

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:32.080
If the traffic doesn't pick up,

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:34.200
she'll have to take responsibility.

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:36.360
Ms. Qian, it's on.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:39.480
Ms. Qian,

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:41.200
Ms. Liao's stream is doing well.

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.120
The numbers are climbing fast.

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.120
Switch it over.

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:47.680
Here it is.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.400
The surprise is coming soon.

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:50.640
Everyone, please like

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:52.520

00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:56.480

Things look good.

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:06.120
Liu Bo,

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:07.600
are you done?

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:09.200
Yes.

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:23.200
Tell everyone to put in some effort.

00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:24.520
They should learn from this.

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:26.080
Let's try

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.280
this park's

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:28.040
ice cream.

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:32.960
Well...

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:37.120
For the price, the taste

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.120
is actually decent.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:40.760
It's okay.

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:45.960
Only twelve people left now.

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:50.760
Hey,

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:53.720
you're one of us now.

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:54.880
Let me check a message.

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:10.000
Says there's an internet celebrity

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.800
doing the turkey dance nearby,

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.360
and I should go check it out.

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:19.680
Forget it, I won't go.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:21.840
I'll just find

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.560
a quiet spot up ahead

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:24.800
and chat with you guys.

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:28.480
Guys, I finished my ice cream.

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:29.920
It was pretty good.

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:31.160
Overall, the taste was alright.

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:33.160
Now I've found

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.040
a quiet spot.

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:35.280
Let's chat for a bit.

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:37.040
Everyone, type out any topics

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:38.520
you want to chat about.

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:39.680
My right eyelid

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:40.600
keeps twitching.

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:45.280
A voice chat?

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:46.560
Sure, I can do that.

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:47.640
But I've never done it before.

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:49.440
How does it work? Should I call you?

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:50.720
Oh, I see.

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:52.040
Is this you now?

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:54.480
Qingwu Feiyang, hello.

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:56.160
[Hello, Desperate Personal Shopper.]

[I use your memes all the time.]

00:30:58.920 --> 00:30:59.960
Okay. Thank you.

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:01.960
How come your voice...

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:03.480
What's going on?

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:04.960
You're using a voice changer, right?

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.200
[For privacy?]

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:07.920
Yeah.

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:11.880
I've known about you for a long time.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.360
You used to be a host

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:15.520
on a TV finance show, right?

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:17.680
Yes.

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:20.240
I was at Lucheng City TV Station.

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:22.120
There was a finance channel.

00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:23.480
A show called

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:24.760
Today's Financial Interview.

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:25.440
I was the host

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:26.760
of that show.

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:28.360
[That was]

[over ten years ago.]

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:31.600
[Thank you for following me.]

[And thank you for remembering me.]

Sure.

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:39.320
When you left the station,

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:41.920
how come you suddenly went abroad?

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:43.800
I heard you married a foreigner.

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:45.800
Did you go to be a housewife?

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:47.560
So how did you end up

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:48.520
as the "Desperate Personal Shopper"?

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:55.160
Hey,

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:56.640
Qingwu Feiyang,

00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:59.320
you're surprisingly well-informed.

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:02.640
Well,

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:04.600
I wouldn't call it "ending up".

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:05.960
Life is like that.

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:07.440
Ups and downs are normal.

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:18.400
So what was the opportunity?

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.720
I'm quite curious.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.120
Tell us about it.

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:26.400
If you want to hear it,

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:27.040
type "1".

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:31.120
See, everyone wants to hear it.

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:32.320
Everyone wants to know

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:33.960
how a former finance host

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:35.560
became the person behind

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:38.000
the "Desperate Personal Shopper" meme.

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:39.600
There must be

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:40.600
quite a story there.

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:41.560
Don't be stingy.

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:42.560
Share it with us.

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:58.480
Alright. Since everyone wants to know,

00:32:58.480 --> 00:32:59.480
I'll talk about it.

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:02.600
When I met my ex-husband,

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:04.000
I was indeed a host

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:05.840
on a show called

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:06.960
Today's Financial Interview.

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:09.600
[That show]

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:10.800
[is still on.]

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:13.240
[Back when I was a host,]

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:14.160
[the standards]

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.320
[for hosts]

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:16.680
[were extremely high.]

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:18.280
[You had to speak foreign languages.]

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:20.680
I could interview

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:21.760
foreign entrepreneurs

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:22.960
entirely in English.

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:24.760
The current host?

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:26.000
[I really...]

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.360
[I can't say she's impressive.]

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:29.480
[She even needs a translator.]

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:30.760
[Might as well let the translator]

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:31.480
[do the interview.]

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:34.600
Hold on.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.120
We want to hear

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:37.960
about you getting married abroad.

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:38.960
So what happened

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.000
after you went abroad?

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:42.080
Bad choice in a partner?

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:43.280
Bad choice in a partner?

00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:43.840
How do you know

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:44.840
I made a bad choice?

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:46.240
[You seem]

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:47.680
[really concerned about me.]

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:48.720
[Thank you.]

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:53.960
You guessed right.

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.880
I did make a bad choice.

00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:58.840
I met my ex-husband

00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:00.120
because of that show.

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:01.440
He came

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:03.240
with a North American delegation.

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:05.200
And then we met.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:06.560
He asked

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:07.880
if I'd go abroad with him,

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:08.760
saying there'd be more room

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:10.600
for my career there.

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:12.440
So I believed him

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:13.679
and went with him.

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:16.280
Well, I was young back then.

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:17.639
Young people

00:34:17.639 --> 00:34:19.239
are easily fooled.

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.080
That's just how it is.

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:22.840
Not just because you were young, right?

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:26.000
Weren't there

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:27.719
some vanity involved?

00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:41.400
If you put it that way,

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:42.440
then I have to honestly

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:43.600
admit it.

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:47.960
I was vain back then.

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:49.400
But I

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.040
paid the price for it.

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:53.760
[Not long after I went to Canada]

00:34:54.719 --> 00:34:56.159
[with him,]

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:57.920
[I realized I'd been deceived.]

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:00.040
And the moment

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:01.560
I realized it,

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:02.520
I decided to

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:03.840
divorce him.

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:08.320
Ms. Qian, Ran's numbers are climbing!

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:12.480
But even to this day,

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:13.560
I don't regret it.

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:15.400
Because

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:16.960
I've always been honest

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.680
with myself.

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:21.760
[I didn't want to]

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:23.320
[cling to a bad marriage]

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:24.240
[for the sake of face,]

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:27.120
so I ended it.

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:29.280
Are you satisfied

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:31.080
with my answer, Qingwu Feiyang?

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:39.520
Hello?

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:41.680
You left?

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:43.160
[At least say goodbye.]

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:44.600
[I'm pouring my heart out here.]

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:47.240
I'm here. Don't hang up.

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:48.520
Wait a moment.

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:50.040
Zhang Ran's impressive.

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:50.960
The numbers are climbing fast.

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:51.400
Ms. Qian,

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:52.760
Zhang Ran's stream is doing well now.

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:54.040
Should we push a traffic package?

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:54.880
Do it.

00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:57.400
So you've been single all these years

00:35:57.880 --> 00:35:59.000
since the divorce?

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:00.920
You never remarried?

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:02.040
I did.

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:04.480
My current marriage is great.

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:05.920
My husband treats me well.

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:09.200
Your husband is so good to you?

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:10.600
Then

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:12.240
how come he let you

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:13.200
do this personal shopping?

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.240
What does he do?

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:17.120
He

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:18.240
works with his hands,

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:19.440
making a living on his own.

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:21.960
He does renovations

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:23.560
in Canada.

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:25.240
Doesn't sound like

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:26.600
a respectable job.

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:31.200
Worldly respectability

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:32.400
isn't important.

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:34.120
What matters is the person.

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:36.680
[After]

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:37.840
[a failed marriage,]

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:38.920
[actually,]

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:41.560
I realized

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:42.240
that external,

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:43.200
worldly success

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:44.240
and possessions

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:45.120
are not

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:46.480
that important.

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:48.360
What matters most is sincerity.

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:52.160
If a man

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:54.360
has no money or status,

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:56.240
isn't he just all talk?

00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:57.760
Saying nice things

00:36:58.560 --> 00:36:59.920
makes him sincere?

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:01.880
You can't be that naive.

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:04.320
There must be something we don't know.

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:06.120
Is it something you can't talk about?

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:09.440
So that's what you think?

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:11.800
I don't need to explain

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:13.200
what my own husband is like to you.

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:14.120
Marriage is like a private journey.

00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:15.840
Only the couple

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:17.040
knows if it's rewarding.

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.400
Your time is about up, right?

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:19.960
Should we switch to another guy?

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:21.960
Don't hang up.

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:24.640
Are you getting upset all of a sudden?

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:25.520
So sensitive.

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:27.080
Seriously?

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:28.720
That's not streamer material.

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:47.800
Alright. Since everyone wants to know,

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:48.800
I'll talk about it.

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:53.320
I met my husband

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:54.920
during

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:56.960
the darkest time of my life.

[My husband is a repairman.]

The day I met him,

00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:30.840
I was going through

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:31.960
something really rough.

00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:34.360
And it was my birthday.

Happy birthday.

00:38:58.640 --> 00:38:59.760
He made me a cake

out of rice.

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:02.560
Because

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:04.080
the bakery was already closed.

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:06.360
And he drew a candle,

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:07.680
stuck it in the cake,

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.320

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:24.720
Okay.

It's just for show.

00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:39.640
Don't actually eat it.

Isn't this rice?

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:42.440
It's edible, isn't it?

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:43.520
I haven't had

00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:44.520

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:46.960
Back then,

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:48.920
when I was really down,

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:53.480
that cake

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:54.400
really touched me.

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:57.640
And that's how we met

00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.040
and got started.

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:00.600
That's it.

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.240
Does your room have everything?

00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:07.600
Yes.

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:09.480
I've been living here for two years.

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:13.520
Do you live alone?

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:18.440
Let's give it a try.

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:20.200
A bowl of rice

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:21.320
won you over?

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:22.960
So this Rice Guy

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:24.200
sounds a bit unreliable.

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:25.200
Like a scammer.

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:26.320
Yes.

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:27.760
I was fooled

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:29.040
by Rice Guy's one bowl of rice.

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:31.480
Back then,

00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:32.880
we weren't doing well.

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:34.880
So I started doing personal shopping.

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:37.200
To be honest,

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:39.000
I was still pretty vain back then.

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:41.720
[I kept posting selfies,]

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.480
[lying to family and friends back home,]

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:44.520
[saying I lived in a villa]

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:45.680
[and bought luxury brands,]

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:48.080
just to show off how well I was doing.

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:50.640
That's how I was

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:52.080
during that time.

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:54.280
[So]

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:57.240
[are you satisfied with my answer,]

00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:58.040
Qingwu Feiyang?

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:01.840
Look, you're getting worked up again.

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:03.360
Alright. I'll stop.

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:05.000
I'm not worked up.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.000
I'm an internet celebrity.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:06.960
I'm already a joke

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:07.680
online.

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:09.080
I won't get worked up.

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:10.520
At least my husband

00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:11.840
gave me a bowl of rice.

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:14.440
What about you? Are you doing well now?

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:19.400
[Qingwu Feiyang,]

00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:21.840
I've figured out who you are.

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:23.360
Your username

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:24.440
sounds like it's from way back.

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:26.440
I was thinking

00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:27.280
about it just now.

00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:29.560
Your QQ username was the same.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.040
I'm already a joke

00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:32.800
online anyway.

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:33.760
I don't care.

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:36.840
Should I say who you are?

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:42.120
Can I say it?

00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:00.320
Alright. Since you've already left,

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:01.720
I won't keep pushing it.

00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:03.040
Though you've left,

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:04.760
I know you're still watching.

00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:06.720
And among all the other people

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:08.800
in this live stream,

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:10.360
there must be my old friends

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:11.280
and former colleagues.

00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:13.120
I want to tell you all here

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:16.080
that I may

00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:17.200
look like a joke now,

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:18.480
but

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:20.920
I don't regret

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:22.480
leaving the TV station at all.

00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:24.680
I don't regret

00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:25.960
any choice I've made.

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:27.600
Because every single one

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:29.280
came from

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:30.480
what I truly felt inside.

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:32.960
I've been completely honest with myself.

00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:00.680
Let me introduce myself again.
