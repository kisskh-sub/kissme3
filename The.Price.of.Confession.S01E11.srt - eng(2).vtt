TWO DAYS BEFORE THE PUBLIC CONFESSION

00:00:50.947 --> 00:00:51.948
That's what they did.

00:00:53.408 --> 00:00:54.576
Yeah, that's right.

00:00:57.203 --> 00:00:59.414
NO CALLER ID

00:01:03.835 --> 00:01:07.797
WHO ARE YOU? WHY ARE YOU SENDING ME THIS?

00:01:07.881 --> 00:01:10.091
Do you know who sent that photo?

00:01:10.175 --> 00:01:13.720
What I needed to ask
was not who sent it, but why.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.433
Why did they send me that photo
pretending to be you?

00:01:19.184 --> 00:01:21.644
When Mo Eun confessed to killing Ki-dae

00:01:23.021 --> 00:01:25.231
and I was released from prison,

00:01:26.316 --> 00:01:28.651
who would've felt uneasy and anxious?

00:01:42.207 --> 00:01:44.667
Why did they kill Ko Se-hun,
pretending to be me?

00:02:11.527 --> 00:02:13.738
LEE KI-DAE: MEMORIAL EXHIBITION

00:02:13.821 --> 00:02:14.822
Ki-dae.

00:02:15.365 --> 00:02:17.742
Is there anything you want to tell me?

00:02:56.531 --> 00:02:57.573
But you did it.

00:03:08.793 --> 00:03:09.627
Ms. An.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.380
Mr. Jin, what are you doing here?

00:03:13.881 --> 00:03:15.300
I teach here.

00:03:15.383 --> 00:03:16.718
Anyway, what happened?

00:03:16.801 --> 00:03:18.511
You're wanted by the police.

00:03:18.594 --> 00:03:22.015
Do you have any idea
how worried Mr. Jang is?

00:03:24.726 --> 00:03:27.437
Are you here to see your husband's work?

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.646
Yes.

00:03:29.314 --> 00:03:31.941
But I found something strange
in that image.

00:03:32.608 --> 00:03:33.651
What is it?

00:03:33.735 --> 00:03:37.030
I'm not sure if Ki-dae left it there
or someone else did.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.073
Could you help me?

00:03:39.657 --> 00:03:40.533
Yes, of course.

00:03:55.465 --> 00:03:57.133
HONGSEO ART GALLERY OPENED IN 2022

00:03:57.925 --> 00:04:01.471
HONGSEO EDUCATIONAL FOUNDATION DIRECTOR
AND HONORED GUESTS ON OPENING DAY

00:04:06.601 --> 00:04:07.643
Ms. An?

00:04:11.731 --> 00:04:12.607
Actually…

00:04:15.318 --> 00:04:16.277
never mind.

00:04:18.196 --> 00:04:19.906
I'll find out and get back to you.

00:04:20.948 --> 00:04:21.783
Ms. An.

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:24.243
Ms. An!

00:06:06.762 --> 00:06:09.390
I never imagined
Attorney Jin Young-in would take the case.

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.272
Without my client's consent,

00:06:16.772 --> 00:06:18.107
I'd never read it.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.444
Why didn't he tell me he knew Ki-dae?

00:06:22.653 --> 00:06:24.822
If he was the one who killed Ki-dae,

00:06:25.323 --> 00:06:27.241
did he intentionally become
Mo Eun's lawyer

00:06:28.367 --> 00:06:29.368
to approach me?

00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.336
Then did he kill Ko Se-hun too?

00:06:41.005 --> 00:06:43.716
How did he find out
about my deal with Mo Eun?

00:07:17.917 --> 00:07:21.879
ONE DAY BEFORE THE PUBLIC CONFESSION

00:08:16.684 --> 00:08:17.518
Seo-won.

00:08:25.318 --> 00:08:26.360
Yun-su.

00:08:27.528 --> 00:08:28.738
It's been a while.

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:34.118
I'm sorry.

00:08:36.454 --> 00:08:39.123
Even though I thought
you never would've done it,

00:08:39.832 --> 00:08:41.250
I just stayed hidden.

00:08:43.294 --> 00:08:45.421
Did you also help plan the exhibition?

00:08:46.922 --> 00:08:47.923
Yes.

00:08:48.466 --> 00:08:51.010
But why leave the fingerprints,
knowing they were there?

00:08:54.305 --> 00:08:56.641
Because it was Ki-dae's last artwork.

00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:59.644
So I printed it as is.

00:09:00.436 --> 00:09:01.896
He told me

00:09:02.396 --> 00:09:03.814
they were your fingerprints.

00:09:03.898 --> 00:09:05.524
I don't mean mine.

00:09:06.317 --> 00:09:07.652
There's another one.

00:09:08.235 --> 00:09:11.197
Weren't they both yours?

00:09:12.239 --> 00:09:13.699
Could it be an art handler's?

00:09:14.325 --> 00:09:17.078
There's no way
they would've left their fingerprints.

00:09:24.877 --> 00:09:26.712
Have you seen this person before?

00:09:29.173 --> 00:09:30.758
Yes, I remember him

00:09:30.841 --> 00:09:32.259
from the gallery opening.

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:37.556
I think he said he was a law professor.

00:09:38.557 --> 00:09:41.519
Why should I apologize to you? Huh?

00:09:42.019 --> 00:09:46.023
And is it really worth all these calls
and visits to argue about it?

00:09:47.692 --> 00:09:50.111
Oh man, it's like talking to a wall.

00:09:52.822 --> 00:09:55.116
No. Don't ever call me again.

00:09:56.534 --> 00:09:58.869
Is this guy for real?

00:09:58.953 --> 00:10:01.330
Why are you so upset? It's not like you.

00:10:01.414 --> 00:10:02.957
I don't know.

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:07.712
I only said a painting donated
to the school might be plagiarized,

00:10:07.795 --> 00:10:11.298
and this guy keeps harassing me
with calls, even using different numbers.

00:10:11.799 --> 00:10:14.301
And he calls himself a law professor.

00:10:14.385 --> 00:10:16.595
Come on, just ignore him. Okay?

00:10:17.263 --> 00:10:18.597
It'll be fine. Is this it?

00:10:18.681 --> 00:10:20.266
God, don't ask.

00:10:20.766 --> 00:10:23.602
BEYOND SOKOBOAKO'S PLAGIARISM
WILL THE TRUTH COME OUT?

00:10:26.814 --> 00:10:30.901
Ki-dae was harassed
over the Sokoboako painting.

00:10:31.402 --> 00:10:32.862
And he had a hard time

00:10:33.529 --> 00:10:35.072
because of it.

00:10:37.825 --> 00:10:40.453
Seo-won, I'm sorry,
but can I borrow your car?

00:10:53.966 --> 00:10:55.801
I killed my husband.

00:10:57.428 --> 00:10:58.846
And at the detention center,

00:10:59.722 --> 00:11:02.391
I made a deal with Mo Eun
that I never should have.

00:11:03.309 --> 00:11:06.103
This afternoon,
An, who had been indicted for murder,

00:11:06.187 --> 00:11:10.191
released her own confession video
on her YouTube channel,

00:11:10.274 --> 00:11:11.525
sparking controversy.

00:11:11.609 --> 00:11:13.819
Moreover, she claimed in the video

00:11:13.903 --> 00:11:17.698
that the investigation team ignored
evidence of the presence of a third party

00:11:17.782 --> 00:11:19.909
at the scene of Ko's murder.

00:11:22.536 --> 00:11:24.079
Is there really evidence?

00:11:27.917 --> 00:11:28.918
I'm not sure.

00:11:29.919 --> 00:11:30.753
Honey.

00:11:31.921 --> 00:11:34.590
I don't think that kind of answer
is very helpful.

00:11:39.595 --> 00:11:40.638
Think carefully.

00:11:40.721 --> 00:11:42.264
Did you miss anything?

00:11:43.599 --> 00:11:46.435
Don't you have access to the evidence?

00:12:10.376 --> 00:12:11.752
Yes, Mr. Jang.

00:12:18.926 --> 00:12:20.344
SENDER KO SE-HUN

00:12:20.427 --> 00:12:22.388
I have your daughter.

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:27.268
Don't message or call me.
Just do exactly as I say.

00:12:27.935 --> 00:12:30.271
That's the only way Sop won't get hurt.

00:12:35.401 --> 00:12:37.486
Don't contact anyone.

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:40.072
You can't get caught by the police either.

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:49.039
Come see your daughter by six o'clock.

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:52.042
Then I'll let her go unharmed.

00:12:54.879 --> 00:12:58.215
It's the house with the blue door
in Sarihyeon District 5.

00:13:07.683 --> 00:13:08.517
Why…

00:13:11.145 --> 00:13:12.646
did you hang yourself?

00:13:15.149 --> 00:13:16.483
Because I was scared.

00:13:18.193 --> 00:13:20.779
Requesting backup.
Child abduction in progress.

00:13:20.863 --> 00:13:24.408
The mother is wanted suspect An Yun-su.
The suspect is Ko Dong-uk.

00:13:24.491 --> 00:13:26.994
The suspect's vehicle
is headed toward Sarihyeon.

00:13:27.077 --> 00:13:30.581
Backup units, move to Ko Dong-uk's house
and his other house in Sarihyeon.

00:13:30.664 --> 00:13:33.000
Can you do me a favor?

00:13:51.894 --> 00:13:52.978
Don't be alarmed.

00:13:55.147 --> 00:13:56.690
Don't be scared.

00:14:04.323 --> 00:14:05.532
Inmate 407.

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:07.660
What are you doing?

00:14:17.002 --> 00:14:17.836
Inmate 407.

00:14:18.921 --> 00:14:19.880
Inmate 407.

00:14:20.381 --> 00:14:22.007
Kang, get the doctor now!

00:14:22.716 --> 00:14:23.550
Inmate 407!

00:14:29.098 --> 00:14:30.099
Inmate 407.

00:14:33.769 --> 00:14:35.521
The bleeding's severe. Prepare the OR.

00:14:35.604 --> 00:14:37.815
None of the surgeons are available.

00:14:37.898 --> 00:14:39.900
Call the anesthesiologist
and arrange the OR.

00:14:42.277 --> 00:14:43.904
Please wait in the waiting room.

00:15:06.301 --> 00:15:07.136
Oh my God.

00:15:16.854 --> 00:15:18.439
Breathe.

00:16:00.773 --> 00:16:02.149
Doors closing.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:52.634
Yes, sir.

00:17:52.718 --> 00:17:54.720
So? Did you find anything there?

00:17:54.803 --> 00:17:56.972
Ko Dong-uk was caught
on the kindergarten CCTV.

00:17:57.055 --> 00:17:59.141
The child left holding his hand.

00:17:59.224 --> 00:18:02.436
According to a kid,
Sop said she was going to see her mom.

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:05.147
He took his rifle with him.

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:07.983
Get the units armed,
and proceed with extra caution.

00:18:08.066 --> 00:18:08.901
Yes, sir.

00:18:10.569 --> 00:18:11.403
A gun?

00:18:11.904 --> 00:18:13.155
He's got a gun?

00:18:17.492 --> 00:18:18.911
Where's Mr. Jin?

00:18:19.703 --> 00:18:20.579
Mr. Jin is--

00:18:20.662 --> 00:18:22.164
Weren't you with him?

00:18:22.247 --> 00:18:26.168
We left the police station together,
but he went back in.

00:18:27.085 --> 00:18:28.921
Why do you ask?

00:18:34.343 --> 00:18:36.762
There's no dashcam footage from that day.

00:18:37.262 --> 00:18:38.805
An Yun-su was lying.

00:18:39.348 --> 00:18:40.349
By the way,

00:18:40.849 --> 00:18:43.894
I deleted the CCTV footage
from the day I met her at the gallery…

00:18:47.356 --> 00:18:49.399
but she went back alone later.

00:18:49.483 --> 00:18:51.151
Are you looking at the footage?

00:18:51.818 --> 00:18:53.320
She made sure she was seen.

00:18:53.403 --> 00:18:57.032
Also, there was a sketch of you
among the evidence.

00:18:59.326 --> 00:19:00.535
Are you sure it was me?

00:19:01.536 --> 00:19:02.371
Yeah.

00:19:03.789 --> 00:19:05.707
Well, she came back to the gallery.

00:19:06.291 --> 00:19:09.002
And she slipped the police a sketch
that wasn't on the evidence list.

00:19:09.086 --> 00:19:12.005
I think An Yun-su is testing us.

00:19:14.091 --> 00:19:15.425
That old man…

00:19:18.262 --> 00:19:20.305
is blinded by revenge,

00:19:21.223 --> 00:19:23.433
so he'll act in our favor, won't he?

00:19:25.143 --> 00:19:26.770
We'll have to trust the old geezer.

00:19:27.396 --> 00:19:28.730
Don't worry too much.

00:19:31.525 --> 00:19:34.111
He never said he knew Ms. An's husband.

00:19:34.194 --> 00:19:35.028
Not once.

00:19:35.612 --> 00:19:36.863
Anything else suspicious?

00:19:37.364 --> 00:19:38.282
No, nothing.

00:19:39.616 --> 00:19:41.326
He's just a good person.

00:19:41.868 --> 00:19:43.745
He came to the NFS with me,

00:19:44.246 --> 00:19:46.790
and he went back and forth
between Ms. An and Mo Eun to…

00:19:49.876 --> 00:19:53.213
If that's true,
he could keep an eye on everything.

00:19:53.714 --> 00:19:55.590
On An Yun-su and on Mo Eun.

00:19:58.635 --> 00:20:00.637
An Yun-su came to my workplace.

00:20:01.972 --> 00:20:03.056
She did?

00:20:22.451 --> 00:20:25.662
Please slip this sketch in
with the evidence.

00:20:25.746 --> 00:20:27.706
I'll explain why later.

00:20:28.332 --> 00:20:30.167
I know I'm putting you in a tough spot.

00:20:30.667 --> 00:20:31.960
I'm sorry.

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:53.857
I wasn't sure
if it was the right thing to do,

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:55.400
but I just went ahead with it.

00:20:55.484 --> 00:20:58.028
I've had a lot of questions
about this case myself.

00:21:02.407 --> 00:21:03.950
This is the sketch.

00:21:05.869 --> 00:21:06.703
Hang on.

00:21:08.955 --> 00:21:09.790
This woman…

00:21:09.873 --> 00:21:11.291
Do you know her?

00:21:12.959 --> 00:21:14.169
It's Mr. Jin's wife.

00:21:17.964 --> 00:21:20.592
Mr. Jang, Sop has gone missing.

00:21:20.675 --> 00:21:21.718
What?

00:21:22.344 --> 00:21:24.721
She seems to have been kidnapped.

00:21:24.805 --> 00:21:26.598
A kid said they saw…

00:21:27.099 --> 00:21:28.350
Then don't you think

00:21:28.892 --> 00:21:31.269
Ms. An went public with the confession

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:34.439
and claimed that the police had evidence

00:21:34.523 --> 00:21:37.150
to lure Mr. Jin?

00:21:38.902 --> 00:21:39.736
Sir!

00:21:41.279 --> 00:21:45.117
They found Ko Dong-uk's car 1 km
from the redevelopment area in Sarihyeon.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.701
Team 1, head out to the car.

00:21:46.785 --> 00:21:48.328
-Mr. Jang, follow me.
-Where is it?

00:21:48.412 --> 00:21:49.496
I'll let Mr. Baek know.

00:21:51.289 --> 00:21:52.207
I…

00:21:53.375 --> 00:21:54.751
I stabbed her.

00:21:55.794 --> 00:21:57.587
You have to be honest with me.

00:21:58.463 --> 00:21:59.631
Look me in the eye.

00:22:03.218 --> 00:22:04.678
What did you two talk about?

00:22:05.262 --> 00:22:06.430
Where did she go?

00:22:07.973 --> 00:22:10.600
Can you do me a favor?

00:22:11.393 --> 00:22:14.354
Tell them I kept you alive
so I could kill you myself.

00:22:14.438 --> 00:22:15.939
She said she kept me alive

00:22:17.232 --> 00:22:18.733
so she could kill me herself.

00:22:18.817 --> 00:22:20.152
Be honest!

00:22:20.235 --> 00:22:22.904
Tell them I tried to kill you,
so you stabbed me.

00:22:23.822 --> 00:22:25.240
Just tell them that.

00:22:25.907 --> 00:22:28.118
That's why I stabbed her.

00:22:29.411 --> 00:22:30.620
I swear.

00:22:41.756 --> 00:22:45.427
SARIHYEON DISTRICT 5
REDEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION APPROVED

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.283
Where's Sop?

00:24:33.243 --> 00:24:34.452
Come inside.

00:24:43.295 --> 00:24:44.504
Sop!

00:24:47.841 --> 00:24:48.925
Sop!

00:24:52.887 --> 00:24:54.347
Where's Sop?

00:25:03.815 --> 00:25:04.733
Sop!

00:25:07.235 --> 00:25:08.528
She's just sleeping.

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:16.661
Go sit

00:25:18.121 --> 00:25:19.664
on that chair over there.

00:25:20.749 --> 00:25:22.042
I didn't kill Se-hun.

00:25:25.879 --> 00:25:26.713
Sit.

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:35.263
This is Se-hun's childhood home.

00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:37.849
Back then,

00:25:39.142 --> 00:25:42.145
he used to follow me around so much,
it was almost annoying.

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:48.026
If I die,

00:25:49.194 --> 00:25:51.363
you'll never find Se-hun's killer.

00:26:23.853 --> 00:26:25.355
The house has a blue door.

00:26:25.855 --> 00:26:27.982
We have to hope they're there, don't we?

00:26:28.483 --> 00:26:30.443
They'll be there. I'm sure of it.

00:26:34.406 --> 00:26:35.490
Die.

00:26:36.324 --> 00:26:38.535
You have to die for us to live.

00:26:40.662 --> 00:26:43.415
Please don't kill me.

00:26:44.165 --> 00:26:45.667
I'm sorry.

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:50.505
Consider this divine punishment.

00:26:53.216 --> 00:26:54.384
How did you…

00:27:06.813 --> 00:27:09.858
I didn't know
they had made a deal like that.

00:27:10.358 --> 00:27:11.401
If I did,

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:15.113
I could've stopped An Yun-su
from killing Ko Se-hun.

00:27:16.489 --> 00:27:19.075
I'll set things right from here on.

00:27:19.743 --> 00:27:21.745
We have to get justice for Se-hun.

00:27:22.412 --> 00:27:24.456
There's a lot of evidence to uncover.

00:27:24.956 --> 00:27:27.959
And I can only do that
with your help, sir.

00:27:52.358 --> 00:27:53.818
You got me.

00:27:53.902 --> 00:27:55.528
Red light, green light.

00:27:56.571 --> 00:27:58.364
I got you!

00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:53.670
Don't try so hard.

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:56.673
I'm running out of patience, you see.

00:28:58.466 --> 00:29:00.510
If you want your kid to go unharmed,

00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:02.846
you'd better tell the truth.

00:29:04.931 --> 00:29:06.891
You went into the house,

00:29:06.975 --> 00:29:08.685
and he died that night.

00:29:08.768 --> 00:29:10.395
That's all I know.

00:29:11.312 --> 00:29:13.022
If there's someone else,

00:29:13.106 --> 00:29:15.275
I can find them and kill them too.

00:29:18.611 --> 00:29:20.280
Please let Sop go first.

00:29:26.661 --> 00:29:28.121
Please let her…

00:29:40.174 --> 00:29:41.342
Hold on.

00:29:42.802 --> 00:29:43.720
This might be it.

00:29:57.859 --> 00:29:59.694
Sop, wake up.

00:29:59.777 --> 00:30:01.613
Sop.

00:30:02.822 --> 00:30:04.115
Oh God.

00:30:07.035 --> 00:30:09.245
-Anything upstairs?
-I don't think they're here.

00:30:09.829 --> 00:30:10.788
For God's sake.

00:30:38.775 --> 00:30:40.485
Do you remember?

00:30:45.323 --> 00:30:46.157
We

00:30:46.866 --> 00:30:48.451
used to be neighbors.

00:31:02.382 --> 00:31:04.092
You go that way.

00:31:04.175 --> 00:31:05.093
I'll call you.

00:31:13.351 --> 00:31:15.144
This house with the blue door

00:31:16.646 --> 00:31:19.691
was known as "the colonel's place."

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:47.218
I'm glad you're here.

00:31:47.844 --> 00:31:50.555
You can join her.

00:31:54.308 --> 00:31:56.853
What Se-hun got was divine punishment.

00:31:56.936 --> 00:32:00.690
If you did something that deserves death,
then you should die.

00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:19.727
We've arrived at the scene.

00:33:19.811 --> 00:33:23.189
The area is large, so we'll split up
and start a simultaneous search.

00:33:23.272 --> 00:33:24.273
Please search here.

00:33:24.357 --> 00:33:25.650
-Yes, sir.
-Sweep it.

00:33:25.733 --> 00:33:26.692
Check for anyone.

00:33:40.289 --> 00:33:43.126
An Yun-su didn't kill Ko Se-hun.

00:33:50.341 --> 00:33:51.217
Damn it.

00:34:03.354 --> 00:34:05.439
It looks like the police have arrived.

00:34:07.567 --> 00:34:08.568
It's okay.

00:34:10.319 --> 00:34:13.573
Yes, Mr. Jang. This is the last alley.
I'll head down after I check.

00:34:14.282 --> 00:34:15.158
Yes.

00:34:17.201 --> 00:34:18.035
Okay.

00:34:24.667 --> 00:34:25.835
It's okay.

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:50.234
Sop.

00:34:55.323 --> 00:34:57.033
DETECTIVE RYU JI-SU

00:35:01.329 --> 00:35:03.080
Today was really scary, wasn't it?

00:35:03.164 --> 00:35:04.165
I'm sorry.

00:35:04.916 --> 00:35:08.002
But can you wait
just a little bit longer for Mommy?

00:35:09.503 --> 00:35:11.422
Thanks. I'll be back soon.

00:35:11.923 --> 00:35:14.217
And that man over there

00:35:14.759 --> 00:35:16.177
will keep you safe.

00:35:19.847 --> 00:35:21.682
I'll keep my promise this time.

00:35:24.602 --> 00:35:25.728
Thanks.

00:35:38.157 --> 00:35:39.700
You've got this, right?

00:35:59.428 --> 00:36:01.597
Hey, Detective Ryu. I found Sop.

00:36:02.098 --> 00:36:03.724
Yes, in the last alley.

00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:26.664
Let's go.

00:36:34.338 --> 00:36:35.464
Sop.

00:36:56.736 --> 00:36:59.196
The old geezer couldn't kill An Yun-su.
Mo Eun was…

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:00.573
Fucking hell!

00:37:01.699 --> 00:37:04.160
Mo Eun suddenly showed up
and ruined everything.

00:37:04.785 --> 00:37:06.287
Mo Eun showed up?

00:37:07.872 --> 00:37:09.999
I just don't get it.

00:37:11.042 --> 00:37:13.294
What could possibly be left
between those two?

00:37:17.131 --> 00:37:18.299
It's fine.

00:37:18.883 --> 00:37:20.718
We'll just take it from here.

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:23.554
Honey.

00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:25.598
What about you?

00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:27.600
Are you all right?

00:38:08.557 --> 00:38:10.142
Come on out, you two!

00:38:20.528 --> 00:38:22.071
Here, have some coffee.

00:38:22.905 --> 00:38:24.782
The cops might track you down.

00:38:25.616 --> 00:38:27.785
Just say you were threatened
and had no choice.

00:38:28.953 --> 00:38:29.787
What?

00:38:32.373 --> 00:38:33.582
Thank you for this.

00:38:36.085 --> 00:38:37.336
Eun.

00:38:47.304 --> 00:38:49.682
Packed a lot for someone
who wants to die, haven't I?

00:39:17.918 --> 00:39:19.044
Are you all right?

00:39:27.928 --> 00:39:30.723
Is Mo Eun your real name?

00:39:41.817 --> 00:39:43.319
Kang So-hae

00:39:44.069 --> 00:39:45.571
is my real name.

00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:49.992
Mo Eun is a name I was gifted.

00:40:20.981 --> 00:40:22.399
Are you okay?

00:40:24.276 --> 00:40:27.279
Please help me.

00:40:29.823 --> 00:40:31.116
Were you bitten by a spider?

00:40:44.004 --> 00:40:45.214
Shut your eyes. I'll help.

00:41:04.024 --> 00:41:06.694
This is the only spot with reception,

00:41:06.777 --> 00:41:09.989
so I have to wait here
until my sister video calls me.

00:41:17.454 --> 00:41:18.414
Thank you.

00:41:29.049 --> 00:41:30.050
You seem lost.

00:41:32.761 --> 00:41:34.888
We're always short-handed here.

00:41:35.806 --> 00:41:37.099
Do you want to stay with us?

00:41:40.728 --> 00:41:43.022
Are you sure I can?

00:41:45.065 --> 00:41:45.983
Of course.

00:41:52.698 --> 00:41:57.202
To prevent and block
the growing spread of COVID-19,

00:41:57.286 --> 00:42:01.081
all border checkpoints,
trade facilitation points, and crossings…

00:42:01.165 --> 00:42:02.916
I'm going to kill them.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.668
…will be permanently closed.

00:42:07.338 --> 00:42:09.965
I'm sorry, So-mang.

00:42:31.403 --> 00:42:32.363
So-hae.

00:42:33.614 --> 00:42:34.448
Will you

00:42:35.658 --> 00:42:38.535
do what I asked now?

00:42:40.829 --> 00:42:41.997
Only then

00:42:43.415 --> 00:42:45.751
will I be able to close my eyes.

00:42:51.382 --> 00:42:53.258
How do you want to die?

00:43:15.447 --> 00:43:17.074
26 KM TO MYANMAR-THAILAND BORDER

00:43:43.851 --> 00:43:45.561
I had no family

00:43:47.479 --> 00:43:49.189
and nowhere to go.

00:43:50.607 --> 00:43:52.651
I was traveling aimlessly

00:43:52.735 --> 00:43:55.237
when I met you here in Thailand.

00:43:56.822 --> 00:43:58.657
And the time we spent together

00:43:59.616 --> 00:44:03.078
was the happiest of my life.

00:44:04.538 --> 00:44:05.581
MO EUN

00:44:05.664 --> 00:44:07.166
It was the first time

00:44:08.834 --> 00:44:12.921
I realized
I could be loved by someone too.

00:44:15.466 --> 00:44:18.010
You've given me so much

00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:21.889
that I'd like to give you
something in return.

00:44:23.974 --> 00:44:25.893
But I don't have much to offer.

00:44:27.978 --> 00:44:30.063
So if you need me for your revenge,

00:44:30.814 --> 00:44:32.608
use me all you want.

00:44:47.039 --> 00:44:49.833
Those were her last words.

00:44:59.301 --> 00:45:02.137
But why are you helping me?
I didn't stick to our deal.

00:45:04.848 --> 00:45:06.391
Now that I think about it…

00:45:08.435 --> 00:45:09.520
you're right.

00:45:19.571 --> 00:45:22.366
Now that you've confessed
to killing your husband,

00:45:23.367 --> 00:45:25.911
how will you clear your name
without evidence?

00:45:27.204 --> 00:45:28.539
There is evidence.

00:45:29.373 --> 00:45:30.833
Though I can't say for sure.
