VICTIM

00:01:05.461 --> 00:01:06.671
Here's the wine bottle.

00:01:15.847 --> 00:01:17.182
Harder.

00:01:20.727 --> 00:01:21.686
Again.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.073
It's not looking good.

00:01:35.074 --> 00:01:36.242
If you go on like this,

00:01:36.326 --> 00:01:38.494
you'll never get to see
your daughter again.

00:01:38.995 --> 00:01:39.996
But…

00:01:42.207 --> 00:01:45.668
what if your husband had provoked it?

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:48.713
What if you acted in self-defense,

00:01:48.796 --> 00:01:51.174
and it was unintentional manslaughter?

00:01:51.257 --> 00:01:53.676
You'll likely get eight years
with mitigation.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.138
If you become a model inmate,
you might get out in about five years.

00:01:57.222 --> 00:02:00.391
It'll also save you from moral backlash.

00:02:00.475 --> 00:02:03.686
Most importantly,
when your daughter gets older,

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.105
she'll come to understand you.

00:02:23.998 --> 00:02:25.208
Harder.

00:02:27.502 --> 00:02:28.920
Seriously?

00:02:34.092 --> 00:02:35.927
-Let's turn it around.
-Shall I turn it?

00:02:39.055 --> 00:02:40.431
Face the mannequin,

00:02:41.182 --> 00:02:42.267
and stab it six times.

00:02:54.696 --> 00:02:55.738
I'm here.

00:02:58.908 --> 00:03:00.451
Don't close your eyes.

00:03:12.714 --> 00:03:13.840
It wasn't me.

00:03:16.676 --> 00:03:18.094
I didn't kill him.

00:03:22.557 --> 00:03:24.017
Please help me.

00:03:25.018 --> 00:03:25.852
I didn't kill him.

00:03:25.935 --> 00:03:27.645
-Go back.
-Please believe me.

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:29.605
How could I kill my husband?

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:31.149
-Go back now.
-I didn't.

00:03:31.232 --> 00:03:33.735
Please believe me just this once.

00:03:33.818 --> 00:03:35.320
-Please, just once.
-Hold this.

00:03:35.403 --> 00:03:36.529
Please help me.

00:03:36.612 --> 00:03:39.032
Please believe me. I'm begging you.

00:03:40.825 --> 00:03:43.870
Ms. An, if you didn't commit the crime,

00:03:43.953 --> 00:03:46.998
you normally wouldn't agree to reenact it.

00:03:47.081 --> 00:03:50.084
Why would you show up for the reenactment,
only to deny it?

00:03:50.168 --> 00:03:51.919
Because I didn't do it.

00:03:52.003 --> 00:03:52.920
Ms. An.

00:03:54.672 --> 00:03:58.134
If I admit to it, then to my daughter,
I'd be her dad's killer.

00:03:58.217 --> 00:03:59.302
That can't happen.

00:03:59.802 --> 00:04:02.638
I can't say I killed him when I didn't.

00:04:04.807 --> 00:04:07.477
Your Honor, please find out
the truth in this trial.

00:04:12.148 --> 00:04:13.649
Order in the court.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.151
Silence!

00:04:17.278 --> 00:04:18.154
Ms. An,

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.199
are you denying the charges?

00:04:23.868 --> 00:04:26.704
What are your thoughts on today's verdict?

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.249
I believe the outcome
was both natural and lawful.

00:04:32.293 --> 00:04:34.087
More than the victory itself,

00:04:35.004 --> 00:04:36.923
what matters is that justice was served.

00:04:37.006 --> 00:04:38.299
LIFE IMPRISONMENT FOR TEACHER "A"

00:04:38.383 --> 00:04:41.803
There's actually nothing to celebrate
when the victim can't be brought back.

00:04:41.886 --> 00:04:44.472
But the defendant will pay for her crimes
in prison for life.

00:04:44.555 --> 00:04:47.016
Do you expect the defense to appeal?

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.352
That would be up to them.

00:04:49.435 --> 00:04:51.145
But it won't change anything.

00:05:03.991 --> 00:05:05.284
We're going in now.

00:05:29.851 --> 00:05:30.977
Going up.

00:06:36.334 --> 00:06:40.796
I worked as a dental assistant
at their clinic for a year.

00:06:42.131 --> 00:06:45.468
Throughout the year, they lorded over me
like it was second nature.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.262
They'd called me over that day, too,

00:06:48.346 --> 00:06:51.307
and bossed me around
like I was their maid.

00:06:52.141 --> 00:06:56.437
Why make me prepare
a special meal for their birthday?

00:06:59.941 --> 00:07:03.194
Is that why you killed them so brutally?

00:07:46.279 --> 00:07:48.906
And the drug?
Did you come prepared with it?

00:07:49.824 --> 00:07:52.535
I'd been carrying it in my bag
for a long time,

00:07:53.536 --> 00:07:58.165
thinking I'd kill
those annoying, obnoxious jerks

00:07:58.749 --> 00:08:00.167
if the opportunity came.

00:08:01.377 --> 00:08:04.088
We also found
a surgical scalpel in your bag.

00:08:05.089 --> 00:08:07.174
Did you always carry that around too?

00:08:10.177 --> 00:08:11.971
Was that also meant for the couple?

00:08:12.471 --> 00:08:13.472
No.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.101
That's for self-defense.

00:08:18.144 --> 00:08:19.895
The world is a dangerous place.

00:08:23.524 --> 00:08:26.027
Have you ever used it
to hurt someone else?

00:08:28.487 --> 00:08:29.488
No.

00:08:30.281 --> 00:08:31.282
Not yet.

00:08:34.619 --> 00:08:35.620
"Not yet"?

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:43.878
What about your fingerprints?
What happened to them?

00:08:44.629 --> 00:08:48.174
This is from handling chemicals
at the clinic last year.

00:08:49.425 --> 00:08:51.135
When I peel them off like this,

00:08:51.761 --> 00:08:53.012
it feels good.

00:08:53.596 --> 00:08:55.139
It doesn't feel like my own skin.

00:08:55.222 --> 00:08:57.975
So that's why you've left them like that?

00:08:59.435 --> 00:09:02.647
These might be useful to you, detectives.

00:09:03.731 --> 00:09:05.399
But not so much for me.

00:09:06.734 --> 00:09:07.735
Hey.

00:09:08.611 --> 00:09:09.820
You think this is funny?

00:09:12.948 --> 00:09:13.783
By the way,

00:09:14.283 --> 00:09:16.327
could I get something to drink?

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:17.411
-You fucking--
-Hey!

00:09:19.538 --> 00:09:21.374
What kind of drink? Coffee or green tea?

00:09:22.667 --> 00:09:23.668
Coffee, please.

00:09:24.251 --> 00:09:25.503
No cream or sugar.

00:09:27.088 --> 00:09:28.089
Come with me.

00:09:32.635 --> 00:09:34.053
Detective Bae, coffee, please.

00:09:34.136 --> 00:09:36.013
-Without cream or sugar.
-Sure.

00:09:36.514 --> 00:09:37.556
You did well.

00:09:38.099 --> 00:09:40.184
How much longer
do we have to treat her like a human?

00:09:40.267 --> 00:09:41.477
You held it in. Good.

00:09:43.688 --> 00:09:45.398
What do you make of her?

00:09:47.066 --> 00:09:48.150
I'm not sure.

00:09:50.027 --> 00:09:51.445
It's hard to tell.

00:09:51.529 --> 00:09:52.738
Hard to tell what?

00:09:53.239 --> 00:09:54.407
She's just a crazy bitch.

00:10:02.498 --> 00:10:04.125
-Thank you.
-No problem.

00:10:04.917 --> 00:10:06.794
Dr. Lee, thank you for coming.

00:10:06.877 --> 00:10:08.421
-Hello, sir.
-Seriously? This late?

00:10:08.921 --> 00:10:10.214
I went home early for once.

00:10:10.297 --> 00:10:12.550
I know. I'm so sorry.

00:10:12.633 --> 00:10:13.509
What's she like?

00:10:14.009 --> 00:10:17.596
She's answering all of our questions
almost too nicely.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:21.559
"Nicely"? Do you really think
that word fits the likes of them?

00:10:22.059 --> 00:10:23.769
Let me correct it to "precisely."

00:10:26.981 --> 00:10:31.527
You didn't leave the scene and stayed
even after the couple was dead.

00:10:32.027 --> 00:10:33.988
Were you waiting for something?

00:10:35.656 --> 00:10:36.741
I'm not sure.

00:10:38.492 --> 00:10:40.619
Then why did you remain in their house?

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:43.831
I just wanted to…

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:48.252
watch the dead couple a little longer.

00:10:48.836 --> 00:10:49.920
Psychopath--

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:52.840
Okay, then.

00:10:52.923 --> 00:10:55.593
At the time, when the couple was dying,

00:10:56.093 --> 00:10:57.511
what did they look like?

00:11:00.806 --> 00:11:01.891
Their bodies…

00:11:04.477 --> 00:11:05.728
shook violently

00:11:07.563 --> 00:11:10.191
like fish out of water.

00:11:10.816 --> 00:11:12.151
Flopping.

00:11:13.152 --> 00:11:17.031
They tore at their lips with their teeth.

00:11:17.531 --> 00:11:20.075
Their eyes rolled back
with only white showing.

00:11:20.826 --> 00:11:22.787
Their hands and feet twisted

00:11:23.913 --> 00:11:25.164
like gnarled branches.

00:11:26.832 --> 00:11:29.460
Their whole bodies writhed like that.

00:11:29.543 --> 00:11:30.920
Slowly,

00:11:32.129 --> 00:11:33.005
little by little…

00:11:36.217 --> 00:11:37.510
they died.

00:11:49.605 --> 00:11:50.439
Ms. Mo,

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:52.900
you know how you said

00:11:53.692 --> 00:11:55.736
you worked with them for a year?

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.155
As they were dying in front of you,

00:11:58.656 --> 00:12:00.950
how do you think they felt?

00:12:03.118 --> 00:12:07.206
Like their hearts were being ripped apart
and burned to ashes.

00:12:08.999 --> 00:12:10.501
It would've hurt them a lot.

00:12:10.584 --> 00:12:13.671
All the while,
regretting what they did to me.

00:12:21.554 --> 00:12:22.847
Do you like cats?

00:12:25.182 --> 00:12:26.767
I used to have one.

00:12:28.269 --> 00:12:29.687
Did you play with it a lot?

00:12:30.604 --> 00:12:31.605
No.

00:12:32.648 --> 00:12:36.443
Did you ever do anything to hurt it?

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:40.281
No matter what they did wrong,

00:12:41.073 --> 00:12:43.784
you shouldn't hurt an animal
that can't speak for itself.

00:12:45.202 --> 00:12:47.413
Then why did you take it so far
with the couple?

00:12:47.496 --> 00:12:50.749
No matter what they did,
they were still people.

00:12:51.667 --> 00:12:53.043
That's wrong, isn't it?

00:12:55.421 --> 00:12:57.131
It's because they were people.

00:13:10.769 --> 00:13:12.062
Here.

00:13:13.647 --> 00:13:16.400
Can you pick out the person crying
because they're sad?

00:13:19.945 --> 00:13:21.196
By any chance,

00:13:21.697 --> 00:13:23.657
is this a test for psychopaths?

00:13:26.076 --> 00:13:27.369
Dr. Lee,

00:13:28.662 --> 00:13:31.081
do I look like a psychopath to you?

00:13:35.961 --> 00:13:38.631
Let us through.
Someone's going to get hurt!

00:13:38.714 --> 00:13:40.299
-Hey, watch your step!
-Oh man!

00:13:40.382 --> 00:13:41.800
What was your motive?

00:13:41.884 --> 00:13:43.928
-Make way!
-How do you feel right now?

00:13:44.011 --> 00:13:44.929
Do you trust the law?

00:13:45.012 --> 00:13:46.513
-Aren't you sorry?
-Watch out!

00:13:46.597 --> 00:13:48.974
-Make way! You'll get hurt!
-Later! I said later!

00:13:49.058 --> 00:13:51.352
-Just say a few words!
-Did you even have a motive?

00:13:51.435 --> 00:13:53.604
Answer one question! Just one!

00:13:53.687 --> 00:13:55.064
Answer just one question!

00:13:55.147 --> 00:13:57.149
The deceased couple had a son.

00:13:57.232 --> 00:13:59.401
Anything to say to the boy left all alone?

00:14:04.365 --> 00:14:09.536
I'm sure you know, but your mom and dad
weren't exactly good people.

00:14:10.454 --> 00:14:11.997
Blame your parents…

00:14:14.917 --> 00:14:16.752
for making you pay the price.

00:14:17.252 --> 00:14:19.171
-What do you mean?
-What are you saying?

00:14:19.254 --> 00:14:20.673
Why did you stay at the scene?

00:14:20.756 --> 00:14:23.717
Go on! Keep talking!

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:39.274
Inmate 2784.

00:14:40.567 --> 00:14:42.444
Inmate 2784, An Yun-su.

00:14:43.904 --> 00:14:45.739
Go to visiting room 4.

00:14:47.199 --> 00:14:48.659
Figured it would be.

00:14:50.077 --> 00:14:51.787
That's not like you.

00:14:55.666 --> 00:14:57.209
Why did you do it?

00:14:57.918 --> 00:14:59.753
Why did you do the reenactment?

00:14:59.837 --> 00:15:02.047
How did Ki-dae end up being the bad guy?

00:15:02.548 --> 00:15:04.842
What happened between you two?

00:15:07.886 --> 00:15:08.971
Yun-su.

00:15:10.347 --> 00:15:13.434
I'm on your side no matter what,
so just tell me everything.

00:15:14.393 --> 00:15:15.644
Tell you what?

00:15:18.147 --> 00:15:19.898
Whether I killed Ki-dae or not?

00:15:21.567 --> 00:15:23.110
Is that what you're asking?

00:15:23.819 --> 00:15:25.738
You know that's not what I'm asking.

00:15:29.491 --> 00:15:30.743
I've said all I have to.

00:15:33.954 --> 00:15:35.247
How's Sop doing?

00:15:36.749 --> 00:15:38.751
I miss her, but she shouldn't come, right?

00:15:43.505 --> 00:15:44.423
What is it?

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.218
Did something happen to Sop?

00:15:51.764 --> 00:15:52.723
Yun-su.

00:15:55.559 --> 00:15:56.727
-Mom.
-Yes?

00:15:56.810 --> 00:16:00.189
Did you know Sop's mom killed Sop's dad?

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.404
Jun-u found out.

00:16:08.822 --> 00:16:10.532
He keeps avoiding Sop.

00:16:11.575 --> 00:16:13.285
Even though I know it's not true,

00:16:14.787 --> 00:16:16.622
I don't think I can do this much longer.

00:16:19.583 --> 00:16:20.751
No, Mun-jun.

00:16:21.752 --> 00:16:23.087
What about Sop?

00:16:24.171 --> 00:16:26.381
What is she supposed to do on her own?

00:16:28.509 --> 00:16:31.929
Mun-jun, I can get out of here.

00:16:33.138 --> 00:16:35.516
You know I didn't do it!

00:16:36.767 --> 00:16:39.186
What good is it if only we know the truth?

00:16:39.269 --> 00:16:42.481
No matter how much we deny it,
no one listens.

00:16:46.318 --> 00:16:49.029
Sop will be taken to a good place.

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:51.490
The people there are kind.

00:16:52.074 --> 00:16:54.493
I'll visit her every weekend.

00:16:55.452 --> 00:16:57.746
-Visiting time is over.
-I'm sorry.

00:16:59.581 --> 00:17:02.668
I'll make sure Sop is well cared for.
I'm sorry.

00:17:30.154 --> 00:17:31.113
Think she'll last?

00:17:31.196 --> 00:17:34.408
I'll bet a month's special meals
she'll hang herself in three months.

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:38.704
You fucking bitch!

00:17:38.787 --> 00:17:39.955
For fuck's sake!

00:17:40.038 --> 00:17:43.167
Nature finally called,
and I was trying to concentrate like hell!

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:44.668
You fucking bitch!

00:17:44.751 --> 00:17:47.212
You bitch, why are you crying? What for?

00:17:47.296 --> 00:17:49.506
Doesn't your damn kid
want to see you anymore?

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:52.801
She's never seeing you again, is she?
Fuck, not after killing her dad.

00:17:52.885 --> 00:17:56.305
What the fuck did you expect?
You piece of shit.

00:17:56.388 --> 00:17:57.472
Goddamn bitch.

00:17:57.556 --> 00:17:58.891
Hey, you fucking bitch.

00:17:58.974 --> 00:18:01.435
Fucking think about it, you shithead.

00:18:01.518 --> 00:18:04.396
How the hell can she call the bitch
who killed her dad "Mom"?

00:18:04.479 --> 00:18:06.440
You listen to me, fucking bitch.

00:18:06.523 --> 00:18:09.318
For the rest of your fucking life,

00:18:09.401 --> 00:18:12.821
you'll be nothing but a fucking bitch
to your damn kid, you bitch.

00:18:12.905 --> 00:18:14.198
You fucking bitch!

00:18:15.032 --> 00:18:15.991
That fucking bitch.

00:18:20.871 --> 00:18:22.206
The fuck you looking at?

00:18:22.289 --> 00:18:23.957
I'm going to rip your damn mouth open!

00:18:24.041 --> 00:18:25.334
Fuck! You bitch!

00:18:32.174 --> 00:18:33.800
GYEONGGI BUKBU DETENTION CENTER

00:19:10.796 --> 00:19:12.464
INMATE NUMBER 407
NAME MO EUN

00:19:12.547 --> 00:19:13.715
Look straight ahead.

00:19:15.384 --> 00:19:16.635
Face the sign forward.

00:19:18.595 --> 00:19:20.222
Strip to your underwear.

00:19:26.144 --> 00:19:28.021
What the hell has she done to her body?

00:19:30.524 --> 00:19:31.566
Close the lid.

00:19:36.989 --> 00:19:38.031
The watch…

00:19:39.574 --> 00:19:41.326
But I got permission earlier.

00:19:59.511 --> 00:20:00.595
Get going.

00:20:06.977 --> 00:20:09.021
-What a pretty face you've got.
-Stop.

00:20:09.104 --> 00:20:11.606
-2918, 1828, 5168. Step forward.
-What landed you here?

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:13.525
Hey, you've got my attention!

00:20:13.608 --> 00:20:15.027
-Damn it. Hey!
-Quiet down.

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:16.695
The fuck you looking at, bitch?

00:20:16.778 --> 00:20:17.863
-Quiet!
-Stop staring.

00:20:17.946 --> 00:20:19.781
-How'd you end up--
-Be quiet!

00:20:20.282 --> 00:20:21.325
Get going.

00:20:21.408 --> 00:20:24.328
-Put the box down. Take off your shoes.
-Hey, come over here.

00:20:24.411 --> 00:20:25.954
Can't you hear me?

00:20:26.705 --> 00:20:27.873
Get against the wall.

00:20:28.373 --> 00:20:30.208
-Against the wall!
-Did she self-harm?

00:20:31.209 --> 00:20:33.003
She got into it with Rowdy in Cell 5.

00:20:47.017 --> 00:20:50.771
I didn't kill him. It wasn't me!

00:20:50.854 --> 00:20:54.149
Please. Someone, please believe me.
It's not me!

00:20:54.232 --> 00:20:55.233
No one will believe…

00:20:55.317 --> 00:20:57.819
With Rowdy?
That bitch can barely walk on her own.

00:20:57.903 --> 00:21:00.739
God, that's why she ended up like that.

00:21:00.822 --> 00:21:02.949
Her head was smashed into the wall
over and over,

00:21:03.033 --> 00:21:05.035
but she never begged for her life.

00:21:27.307 --> 00:21:31.019
If it were any lower,
you'd have a huge scar on your forehead.

00:21:31.103 --> 00:21:32.104
Man.

00:21:33.897 --> 00:21:38.318
You're thinking, what's a scar
to someone who wants to die, right?

00:21:39.403 --> 00:21:42.197
They say when animals kill themselves,

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:44.825
they usually smash their heads into rocks.

00:21:44.908 --> 00:21:46.535
-Hey, what is she…
-What the hell?

00:21:46.618 --> 00:21:48.161
-Hey!
-Hey, stop her! Hurry!

00:21:48.245 --> 00:21:49.579
-Hey!
-What's wrong with you?!

00:21:50.872 --> 00:21:51.832
Let go!

00:21:57.254 --> 00:21:58.922
Guard!

00:21:59.548 --> 00:22:00.966
Guard! Over here!

00:22:01.967 --> 00:22:06.263
But even animals won't kill themselves
if they have little ones to care for.

00:22:08.682 --> 00:22:10.100
I heard you have a little girl.

00:22:10.183 --> 00:22:12.477
Surely you're not worse than an animal.

00:22:13.353 --> 00:22:14.813
I'll take her if you're done.

00:22:17.023 --> 00:22:19.860
Don't lift your head, ma'am.
Just stay lying down.

00:22:22.737 --> 00:22:24.823
-She's going to solitary, isn't she?
-Yes.

00:22:24.906 --> 00:22:26.324
She shouldn't move right now.

00:22:26.408 --> 00:22:28.869
With head injuries,
an emergency could happen anytime.

00:22:29.953 --> 00:22:30.996
Let her eat here,

00:22:31.079 --> 00:22:33.915
and I'll check for dizziness
or nausea afterward.

00:22:36.334 --> 00:22:39.087
Please don't talk
to the prisoner unnecessarily.

00:22:41.089 --> 00:22:42.007
Yes, ma'am.

00:22:48.513 --> 00:22:50.140
Mealtime!

00:22:53.351 --> 00:22:54.519
I'm hungry. Hurry up.

00:22:54.603 --> 00:22:55.979
Give us a big serving too.

00:22:56.062 --> 00:22:57.981
-Yeah.
-You're getting plenty.

00:22:58.064 --> 00:22:59.191
Just give it here.

00:23:03.278 --> 00:23:04.237
Dear me.

00:23:09.993 --> 00:23:13.455
She hasn't earned her keep yet,
and she's already at the table?

00:23:13.538 --> 00:23:14.456
Sis.

00:23:17.584 --> 00:23:19.169
Even the best views need a full stomach.

00:23:20.086 --> 00:23:21.421
What should we do?

00:23:21.505 --> 00:23:23.882
Earning her keep can wait,

00:23:23.965 --> 00:23:26.843
but she needs to introduce herself
if she wants to eat together.

00:23:28.637 --> 00:23:31.056
So what are you in for, babe?

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:33.016
Scamming rich guys?

00:23:33.767 --> 00:23:34.601
Drugs?

00:23:36.937 --> 00:23:38.271
Murder.

00:23:42.901 --> 00:23:43.902
Hey.

00:23:44.778 --> 00:23:48.740
Are you telling me that you killed someone
with that face and those twig-like arms?

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:51.117
How did you kill them?

00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:56.206
Even if my arms are thin,
they're strong enough to poison food.

00:23:56.957 --> 00:24:00.001
Their bodies writhed,
and their insides burned.

00:24:00.502 --> 00:24:01.962
That's how I killed them.

00:24:04.047 --> 00:24:05.215
Yeah, right.

00:24:05.298 --> 00:24:08.468
How dare you bullshit me
when you're only a newbie.

00:24:09.261 --> 00:24:10.345
I'm not bullshitting.

00:24:10.845 --> 00:24:12.722
Should I show you sometime?

00:24:12.806 --> 00:24:16.977
I can whip one up
from a few pills lying around here.

00:24:17.561 --> 00:24:18.562
Did you just smile?

00:24:21.064 --> 00:24:23.650
You piece of shit.
You're fucking dead, bitch!

00:24:23.733 --> 00:24:25.986
-You fucking bitch!
-Oh no!

00:24:26.069 --> 00:24:27.696
This fucking bitch!

00:24:27.779 --> 00:24:29.281
-Smile again, bitch!
-Oh my God.

00:24:29.364 --> 00:24:31.157
Hey! Smile again!

00:24:31.241 --> 00:24:34.536
I dare you.
Smile again! You fucking bitch!

00:24:34.619 --> 00:24:36.246
You goddamn bitch!

00:24:36.871 --> 00:24:38.582
Get up, you motherfucker.

00:24:38.665 --> 00:24:42.043
Let's give you a proper welcome today.
You fucking bitch.

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:46.631
You fucking bitch!

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:50.135
Come on, smile again. You bitch!

00:24:50.218 --> 00:24:52.262
Why don't you kill me too? Fucking bitch.

00:24:53.346 --> 00:24:55.056
Fuck!

00:24:59.144 --> 00:25:02.606
Fucking cocky for a bitch who ain't shit.

00:25:03.273 --> 00:25:04.107
Man.

00:25:09.946 --> 00:25:11.573
This is the aorta.

00:25:12.073 --> 00:25:14.284
The most vital part of a human,
yet the weakest.

00:25:14.367 --> 00:25:16.870
Your blood will spray everywhere
with just a 1-mm tear.

00:25:16.953 --> 00:25:18.830
The doctors here can't save you,

00:25:18.913 --> 00:25:21.750
and you'll bleed out and die
on the way to the hospital.

00:25:21.833 --> 00:25:24.586
What? You think this is bullshit too?

00:25:25.962 --> 00:25:27.672
I can prove it right now.

00:25:31.051 --> 00:25:31.885
What do you say?

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:22.018
Hey! Over here!

00:26:23.103 --> 00:26:24.062
Help me!

00:26:25.647 --> 00:26:26.731
What? What do you want?

00:26:26.815 --> 00:26:28.024
There's a spider in here.

00:26:29.609 --> 00:26:32.404
-Inmate 407, are you kidding--
-I have arachnophobia!

00:26:32.487 --> 00:26:35.198
Even a tiny spider can paralyze
my whole body.

00:26:35.281 --> 00:26:37.617
Please help me! I've got to get out!

00:26:37.701 --> 00:26:39.661
Fine, come on out.

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:06.104
This room doesn't have any cobwebs,
so get inside.

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:08.148
Nothing's there, right?

00:27:08.648 --> 00:27:09.858
You checked?

00:27:22.954 --> 00:27:25.373
If you see another spider,
tell me right away

00:27:25.457 --> 00:27:27.250
instead of causing a problem later.

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:39.424
You want to get out of here, don't you?

00:29:43.428 --> 00:29:44.596
Who's there?

00:29:49.767 --> 00:29:51.519
I saw you on the news.

00:29:53.521 --> 00:29:56.149
I saw you yelling, begging everyone

00:29:56.733 --> 00:29:57.984
to believe you.

00:29:59.611 --> 00:30:01.654
"I didn't kill him."

00:30:03.239 --> 00:30:05.658
"Please believe me."

00:30:06.951 --> 00:30:08.661
"It wasn't me."

00:30:10.496 --> 00:30:13.583
I've never seen
such a desperate face before.

00:30:15.126 --> 00:30:16.336
Who are you?

00:30:22.926 --> 00:30:24.052
A witch.

00:30:25.678 --> 00:30:26.804
A murderer.

00:30:29.015 --> 00:30:30.433
A psychopath.

00:30:33.728 --> 00:30:36.773
But to you, I could be an angel.

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:41.235
An angel that will get you out of here.

00:30:47.784 --> 00:30:52.664
CELL 4, 407, MO EUN
CELL 5, 2784, AN YUN-SU

00:30:52.747 --> 00:30:54.374
About your husband…

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.671
I'll confess to killing him.

00:31:01.714 --> 00:31:04.133
Admitting another murder

00:31:05.718 --> 00:31:07.637
won't change anything for me anyway.

00:31:11.557 --> 00:31:13.434
What are you saying?

00:31:15.353 --> 00:31:17.438
It's not for free, of course.

00:31:19.232 --> 00:31:21.943
There's something
you need to do for me too.

00:31:28.032 --> 00:31:33.579
1 WEEK LATER

00:31:43.464 --> 00:31:44.757
Inmate 2784, step out.

00:31:53.266 --> 00:31:54.183
Get going.

00:32:07.947 --> 00:32:09.365
What's she doing? So creepy.

00:32:09.449 --> 00:32:12.452
She was quiet all week,
then suddenly got like that.

00:32:14.203 --> 00:32:17.540
What am I supposed to do?
It's just 407 and me here tonight.

00:32:19.834 --> 00:32:20.668
Let's go.

00:32:53.659 --> 00:32:56.871
If you haven't eaten,
come and stuff your face.

00:33:03.669 --> 00:33:06.547
Do you happen to keep
any newspapers around?

00:33:07.507 --> 00:33:09.342
Look who decided to talk.

00:33:10.093 --> 00:33:11.719
So do you keep any around?

00:33:12.553 --> 00:33:14.806
Why would you look for them
during our damn meal?

00:33:15.389 --> 00:33:17.141
They're right over there!

00:33:18.643 --> 00:33:19.644
Thank you.

00:33:24.357 --> 00:33:26.359
Well, you don't have to thank me.

00:33:26.943 --> 00:33:28.194
She must like newspapers.

00:33:28.277 --> 00:33:29.737
-Newspapers?
-Yeah.

00:33:29.821 --> 00:33:31.614
Should've given them to her sooner.

00:33:42.125 --> 00:33:44.293
A WOMAN WITH NO FINGERPRINTS
"A WITCH IS BORN"

00:33:51.134 --> 00:33:53.761
WORK OF A PSYCHOPATH?
MURDER SUSPECT'S MOTIVE SPARKS DEBATE

00:33:54.887 --> 00:33:57.098
SUSPECT ADMITS TO CRIME WITH BLANK FACE

00:34:00.393 --> 00:34:01.686
SUSPECT WATCHED THEM DIE

00:34:01.769 --> 00:34:03.437
NOTORIOUS WITCH
REMORSELESS WITCH

00:34:10.361 --> 00:34:13.447
That fucking bitch is noisy as hell.
Goddamn it.

00:34:14.907 --> 00:34:15.741
Man.

00:34:27.295 --> 00:34:30.214
IDENTIFIED AS A NEW KIND OF PSYCHOPATH

00:34:36.012 --> 00:34:39.015
CARRIED POISON, SURGICAL SCALPEL IN BAG
READY TO KILL AT ANY MOMENT

00:34:39.765 --> 00:34:43.102
You're thinking
I'm some girl talking crazy, aren't you?

00:34:44.979 --> 00:34:46.856
You're right. I am talking crazy.

00:34:48.316 --> 00:34:51.485
Because it's something
no one in their right mind would do.

00:34:55.907 --> 00:34:58.242
But still, in the end…

00:34:58.326 --> 00:34:59.535
Stop.

00:34:59.619 --> 00:35:00.745
Inmate 2784.

00:35:00.828 --> 00:35:03.539
…we'll end up doing this crazy thing.

00:35:04.415 --> 00:35:06.000
-Get in the cell.
-Inmate 2784.

00:35:06.626 --> 00:35:09.337
-What…?
-I called you, but you didn't answer.

00:35:11.088 --> 00:35:13.883
Your attorney sent in
his notice of withdrawal.

00:35:17.887 --> 00:35:20.306
I was going to fire him anyway.

00:35:21.849 --> 00:35:24.769
You know you need an attorney
for a murder trial, don't you?

00:35:26.354 --> 00:35:31.108
If you can't find one before trial,
you'll be assigned a public defender.

00:35:37.323 --> 00:35:40.910
As you know, this isn't a trial
to determine your guilt.

00:35:40.993 --> 00:35:45.206
You were arrested at the scene,
and you admitted to all your crimes.

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:49.585
The only thing up for debate
is your sentence. But even then…

00:35:51.963 --> 00:35:54.507
Let's go with
being as remorseful as possible.

00:35:55.216 --> 00:35:58.511
By emphasizing the victims' wrongdoings,
you'll avoid the death sentence.

00:35:59.345 --> 00:36:01.305
If you're lucky,
you'll get about 20 years.

00:36:02.556 --> 00:36:03.808
How does that sound?

00:36:04.308 --> 00:36:06.143
I don't need any of that.

00:36:06.686 --> 00:36:08.437
Just do one thing for me.

00:36:09.146 --> 00:36:11.524
You're not asking for
a psych evaluation, are you?

00:36:12.775 --> 00:36:14.694
It won't just be rejected.

00:36:14.777 --> 00:36:16.946
It doesn't work like that in Korea.

00:36:19.115 --> 00:36:21.867
I have no desire
to be labeled a crazy bitch.

00:36:23.244 --> 00:36:25.162
I'd like a jury trial.

00:36:27.581 --> 00:36:33.587
Look, that's if you have a reason
to ask the jury for leniency.

00:36:33.671 --> 00:36:34.505
But you don't.

00:36:34.588 --> 00:36:36.882
Isn't that better for you too?

00:36:37.883 --> 00:36:41.262
You'll get the verdict in a day
with a jury trial.

00:36:42.638 --> 00:36:45.599
Would you want to handle my case
for a long time?

00:36:50.104 --> 00:36:54.066
The jury trial
for the Dentist Couple Murder defendant

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:56.694
is being held today
at the Gyeonggi Bukbu District Court.

00:36:56.777 --> 00:36:59.572
-What on earth was she thinking?
-I don't know.

00:36:59.655 --> 00:37:02.074
…requested a jury trial.

00:37:02.575 --> 00:37:06.620
Her motive has sparked mixed opinions
within legal circles.

00:37:07.288 --> 00:37:09.373
There is increasing speculation

00:37:09.457 --> 00:37:14.086
about whether she is trying to move
a jury of ordinary citizens emotionally

00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:15.755
or simply seeking public attention.

00:37:16.339 --> 00:37:21.886
Some claim indiscriminate jury trials
are a waste of taxpayers' money.

00:37:22.887 --> 00:37:25.181
Given the nature of jury trials,

00:37:25.264 --> 00:37:30.019
it is highly likely that the final verdict
will be delivered today.

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:33.564
Get moving.

00:38:24.407 --> 00:38:27.326
Check that they're yours and get changed.

00:38:32.456 --> 00:38:33.499
They're mine.

00:38:36.836 --> 00:38:38.754
Hello? Hey, I'm in the courtroom.

00:38:38.838 --> 00:38:40.673
-Reporter Kim! Over here.
-Hello.

00:38:49.181 --> 00:38:51.934
Just let me in.
Look, there's an empty seat over there!

00:39:00.067 --> 00:39:03.737
Criminal Panel Trial No. 415 of 2022.

00:39:03.821 --> 00:39:07.199
We will now proceed with the trial
of the defendant, Mo Eun,

00:39:07.283 --> 00:39:10.286
who stands indicted for the murder
of Ko Byeong-su and Lee Ye-rim.

00:39:20.629 --> 00:39:22.798
Please remove your mask
before the trial begins.

00:39:33.851 --> 00:39:38.105
At 4:00 p.m. on June 6, 2022,

00:39:38.772 --> 00:39:42.318
the defendant murdered
Ko Byeong-su and Lee Ye-rim

00:39:42.818 --> 00:39:47.031
at the victims' home
in Ilsan, Gyeonggi Province

00:39:47.114 --> 00:39:50.743
by poisoning their food with aconitine
that was prepared earlier.

00:39:51.827 --> 00:39:53.579
Furthermore, the defendant

00:39:54.079 --> 00:39:58.292
committed a deeply disturbing act
by watching the victims die in agony

00:39:58.375 --> 00:40:02.421
for approximately 20 minutes
without making any effort to help.

00:40:04.507 --> 00:40:05.799
Your Honor

00:40:06.884 --> 00:40:08.219
and members of the jury,

00:40:08.719 --> 00:40:10.262
this case has clearly exposed

00:40:10.346 --> 00:40:13.724
the brutal nature
of the defendant's crime.

00:40:14.225 --> 00:40:17.102
The defendant's actions
extend beyond a personal conflict

00:40:17.186 --> 00:40:18.938
and challenge society as a whole.

00:40:19.897 --> 00:40:21.774
Therefore, the prosecution asks

00:40:21.857 --> 00:40:26.737
that the defendant be sentenced
to life imprisonment, the maximum penalty.

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:29.615
Counsel.

00:40:34.995 --> 00:40:36.038
Counsel.

00:40:36.121 --> 00:40:36.956
Yes.

00:40:37.581 --> 00:40:39.917
You have not spoken much today.

00:40:40.501 --> 00:40:42.586
Will you proceed with a closing argument?

00:40:44.505 --> 00:40:45.631
No, Your Honor.

00:40:47.967 --> 00:40:48.801
Very well.

00:40:50.636 --> 00:40:55.599
Members of the jury, this is not a trial
for guilt or innocence.

00:40:56.267 --> 00:41:01.313
What you are asked to consider today
is the defendant's sentence.

00:41:01.397 --> 00:41:05.401
It is indeed difficult to determine
the sentence of another individual.

00:41:06.777 --> 00:41:07.778
Ms. Mo,

00:41:09.238 --> 00:41:11.156
please stand.

00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:18.747
Do you have any last words for the jury?

00:41:19.248 --> 00:41:21.875
If you do, please address them directly.

00:41:32.344 --> 00:41:33.554
Well, Your Honor…

00:41:37.141 --> 00:41:40.436
I have committed another murder.

00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:46.483
What should I do about that?

00:41:49.737 --> 00:41:51.030
Silence in court.

00:41:52.531 --> 00:41:58.162
Ms. Mo, what did you just say?
Did you say another murder?

00:41:59.288 --> 00:42:00.122
Yes.

00:42:01.915 --> 00:42:02.916
Ms. Mo,

00:42:04.126 --> 00:42:05.919
the courtroom is a solemn place.

00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:09.423
Everything you say here must be the truth.

00:42:09.506 --> 00:42:10.799
Therefore,

00:42:12.134 --> 00:42:13.719
please answer carefully.

00:42:17.931 --> 00:42:20.100
I'm confessing that…

00:42:23.437 --> 00:42:24.980
I've killed another person.

00:42:31.612 --> 00:42:33.405
Order! Order in the court!

00:42:44.958 --> 00:42:48.170
At the Dentist Couple Murder trial
that was held this afternoon,

00:42:48.253 --> 00:42:50.923
the defendant confessed to another murder

00:42:51.006 --> 00:42:53.967
during her final statement,
which has left the nation in shock.

00:42:54.468 --> 00:42:55.928
Why did you confess?

00:42:56.011 --> 00:42:57.262
Why wait until now to confess?

00:42:57.346 --> 00:42:59.348
MO CONFESSES TO KILLING
TEACHER A'S HUSBAND AT TRIAL

00:42:59.431 --> 00:43:02.393
When I got to prison, I realized
someone else was locked up for my crime.

00:43:03.644 --> 00:43:07.189
I didn't like that someone else
was getting credit for what I had done.

00:43:08.774 --> 00:43:10.776
If Mo's confession turns out to be true,

00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:15.864
it is highly likely that "A"
will be acquitted of her husband's murder.

00:43:15.948 --> 00:43:17.533
In light of this, on the day of…

00:43:17.616 --> 00:43:20.619
You're thinking
I'm some girl talking crazy, aren't you?

00:43:22.287 --> 00:43:24.164
You're right. I am talking crazy.

00:43:25.541 --> 00:43:29.336
Because it's something
no one in their right mind would do.

00:43:30.838 --> 00:43:33.632
But still, in the end,

00:43:35.426 --> 00:43:37.886
we'll end up doing this crazy thing.

00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:44.893
Exercise time is over due to rain.
Everyone, return to your cell blocks.

00:43:46.061 --> 00:43:50.274
Exercise time is over due to rain.
Everyone, return to your cell blocks.

00:45:09.561 --> 00:45:10.938
Yun-su!

00:45:19.154 --> 00:45:20.989
Good luck!

00:45:28.664 --> 00:45:29.581
Now

00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:32.376
it's time to return the favor.

00:49:21.229 --> 00:49:26.234
