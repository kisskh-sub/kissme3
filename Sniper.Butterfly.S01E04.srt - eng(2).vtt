00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.270
Luckily, the hospital is close.

00:01:51.066 --> 00:01:53.933
If anything had happened to him
after just a few days with us,

00:01:53.955 --> 00:01:55.377
what would we have done?

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:01.910
Sorry. I'll shut my mouth.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:15.420
Li Wu,

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.140
do you know

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.460
you're allergic to seafood?

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:22.700
No.

00:02:22.911 --> 00:02:24.860
But you knew
you were feeling unwell, right?

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.580
Why didn't you say anything?

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.390
Hey, Jin.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.140
He's all right now.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:35.860
He doesn't say anything.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:36.790
That's the problem.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.420
You're right.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.790
Let him rest here

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:41.630
for a bit.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.270
We'll pick up his medicine.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:46.830
We'll be back soon.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.580
What's the matter?

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.180
Why are you so upset?

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:55.790
You scared him.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.300
I just don't understand

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.230
why he can't say things directly.

00:03:01.244 --> 00:03:02.390
I took him to try on shoes.

00:03:02.422 --> 00:03:04.044
They didn't fit,
but he didn't say a word.

00:03:04.044 --> 00:03:05.390
This afternoon, I took him to eat.

00:03:05.444 --> 00:03:07.200
He felt sick
and still didn't say anything.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.420
Am I that scary?

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:09.860
No, you're not.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.020
You're the gentlest little fairy.

00:03:15.622 --> 00:03:18.022
Perhaps it's not that Li Wu
doesn't want to talk to you.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.420
He's just too careful.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:27.230
What do you mean?

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.950
Think about it.

00:03:29.044 --> 00:03:31.644
He just got here
and is living under someone else's roof.

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.620
He has no family around.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.140
You're the only person

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.700
he can rely on right now.

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.950
Maybe no one

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.110
ever taught him

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.790
how to express what he needs,

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.230
or maybe no one

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.822
has ever treated him
as kindly as you do.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.230
He cherishes it.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.700
When people have something they cherish

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.110
or finally get something precious,

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:55.740
they handle it very carefully.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.110
It's late.

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.950
You should head back.

00:04:07.355 --> 00:04:08.830
You sure you don't need me to say?

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:10.460
No need.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:11.070
We'll go home

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.140
once the IV is done.

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.390
Alright. I've got something
early tomorrow morning.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.230
I'll go first.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.140
Li Wu.

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:04.550
I just want you

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:05.790
to accept my care.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:07.740
In a few days,

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.790
you'll start school,

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.060
and I'll be back at work.

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.790
I'll be busy once I'm working.

00:05:13.866 --> 00:05:15.230
Maybe I won't have time for you.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:16.910
So I hope

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.790
you can

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:18.940
settle in quickly

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.670
and fit into your school.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.820
I hope everything I do

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.470
is helpful to you,

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:26.420
and not becomes

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:27.620
a burden.

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:32.750
It's not

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:34.430
a burden.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.110
I never thought that.

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.790
From now on, whatever happens,

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.550
just tell me, okay?

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.830
Okay.

00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:59.310
You...

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.860
You want to use the bathroom?

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.060
When was your last period?

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.230
Last month, I guess.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.300
About four weeks.

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:18.670
Is it hard to keep the baby?

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:20.860
Your progesterone level

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:21.700
is low.

00:06:21.844 --> 00:06:23.420
The other readings aren't good either.

00:06:23.688 --> 00:06:24.620
Low progesterone means

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.030
a risk of miscarriage,

00:06:26.177 --> 00:06:28.022
not to mention
you're in early pregnancy.

00:06:28.044 --> 00:06:29.177
Why are you so careless?

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:30.940
I didn't know I was pregnant.

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:32.500
I wasn't paying attention.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.380
What should I be careful about?

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.577
(Emergency Gynecology)
I'll make you a list.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:38.260
Go home and rest these days.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:40.380
I'll give you a well

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.711
of progesterone injections.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:43.700
Okay.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:44.700
Thank you, Madam.

00:07:12.177 --> 00:07:13.470
Is it hard to keep the baby?

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:16.230
Low progesterone means
a risk of miscarriage,

00:07:16.377 --> 00:07:18.022
not to mention
you're in early pregnancy.

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:19.180
Why are you so careless?

00:07:22.333 --> 00:07:23.500
Why did you stop talking

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.670
the moment I walked in?

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:25.500
We were discussing

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.820
the project proposal.

from now on.

00:08:15.488 --> 00:08:16.777
Don't use the paper cup anymore.

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:19.630
Okay.

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.300
This wardrobe is for you.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:33.550
You can put all your things inside.

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:40.380
When you're done unpacking,

00:08:40.622 --> 00:08:41.620
come to the living room.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:17.830
These are things

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:19.260
I like and dislike.

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:20.430
You can write yours

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:21.270

Li Wu, we haven't really
spent time together,

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:31.500
so we don't know each other well.

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:32.830
Writing this helps us

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:34.244
get to know each other quicker.

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:52.540
Can't think of anything?

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:55.980
No one

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:57.860
had asked me before.

00:10:03.622 --> 00:10:05.830
It's fine if you can't
think of anything now.

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.350
Today, I learned

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:09.555
you're allergic to seafood.

00:10:09.622 --> 00:10:11.733
You can add more
whenever you remember something.

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:17.500
And here.

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:18.340
This is for you.

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:25.260
It's my old phone.

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:30.260
Take it.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:31.710
If anything happens at school,

00:10:31.733 --> 00:10:32.990
and you need to contact someone,

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:33.830
it's more convenient.

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:35.190
You won't have to borrow a phone

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:36.350
from teachers or classmates.

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:39.070
Take it.

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.950
Thank you,

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:47.190
Sister.

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:50.150
Try to use it.

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:58.540
There's WeChat in here.

If anything happens,

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:09.500
you can text me.

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:14.590
I saved

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:15.780
four numbers in the phone.

00:11:15.822 --> 00:11:17.470

call any of them.

Try calling me.

Hello?

00:11:50.206 --> 00:11:51.190
Are you still mad

00:11:51.222 --> 00:11:52.540
about what happened earlier?

00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:58.150
I'm not mad.

00:11:58.900 --> 00:11:59.740
Really?

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:00.950
I'm not mad.

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:04.550
Li Wu,

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:07.140
you're going back to school tomorrow.

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:09.260
I hope

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:10.860
it'll be a new start for you.

00:12:12.155 --> 00:12:13.533
Just run without holding back.

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:22.070
Thank you, Sister.

00:12:40.523 --> 00:12:42.470
Are you having NCEE tomorrow?

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:44.430
You're racing against time.

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:55.070

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:57.980
Yes.

Oh, right.

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:01.288
I'll transfer some money to you
on WeChat.

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:06.380
Not much. Just 2,000 yuan.

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:07.500
Just in case.

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:09.220
Well...

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:11.190
I don't need it.

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:12.070
I have my meal card.

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:15.260
What if you need to buy stationery?

00:13:16.111 --> 00:13:17.533
And there are nice places to eat

00:13:17.533 --> 00:13:18.222
near the school.

00:13:18.244 --> 00:13:20.230
You should treat yourself sometimes.

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:28.790
Alright.

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:07.860
Let's take the box

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.190
by the door.

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:22.350
It's messy.

00:14:44.577 --> 00:14:46.020
We're still missing a mosquito net.

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:47.030
We'll buy one later.

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:50.700
By the way,

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:51.860
when your dormmates

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:52.900
are back after classes,

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:54.230
I'll treat them to lunch.

00:14:54.333 --> 00:14:55.733
They'll be your friends.

00:14:55.733 --> 00:14:57.244
Think of it as meeting them early.

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:02.950
What's wrong?

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:06.260
That's too much trouble.

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:09.540
You're right.

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:11.777
People your age probably
talk better among yourselves.

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:13.500
Go make friends on your own.

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:14.710
I won't interfere.

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:15.550
I...

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:17.260
I didn't mean that.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:19.310
I know.

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:20.740
I'm just giving myself

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:21.580
a way out.

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:24.070
Let's go grab a bite.

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:30.660
The parents' group

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:32.911
said you all need to order
custom uniforms these days.

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:34.430
They need your height and weight.

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:35.860
Tell me later.

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:37.950
Parents' group?

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:39.900
What?

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:41.070
Do I not look like a parent?

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:42.660
No, no.

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:47.660
Am I not old enough?

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:49.430
No, that's not it.

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:51.070
What does a parent look like

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:51.910
to you?

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:55.110
Like that over there?

00:15:57.111 --> 00:15:58.710
You can keep up
with your studies, right?

00:15:58.900 --> 00:15:59.740
Study hard.

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:03.740
Or like that one?

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:05.622
You'll do well in your studies.
Just work hard.

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:08.500
No.

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:09.340
It's

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:10.430
because...

00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:14.230
Because you're

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:15.790
a big sister.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.020
Then I'll add my dad to
the parents' group.

00:16:18.044 --> 00:16:20.088
He'll go with you
to pick up the uniforms.

00:16:20.133 --> 00:16:20.900
No, no.

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:21.950
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:22.980
I'm sorry.

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:28.740
I was kidding.

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:33.190
Eat.

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:45.500
Are you happy?

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:47.310
What?

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:50.140
Being back at school

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:52.190
and being able to study

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:53.710
like everyone else.

00:16:56.355 --> 00:16:57.550
I need to go handle something.

00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:00.230
I'll be back after your placement exam.

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:01.550
You go on ahead.

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:06.550
Sister.

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:09.070
Sister.

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:14.750
I didn't accept

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:16.950
the money you transferred this morning.

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:21.140
I don't need it,

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:22.430
and I can't take it.

00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:26.020
Alright.

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:26.860
Up to you.

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:30.340
If I need money,

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:31.230
I'll ask you.

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:24.300
New dormmate?

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:26.550
I'm Cheng Rui.

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:27.870
Let me introduce you.

00:18:29.733 --> 00:18:30.870
Take off your headphones.

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:32.022
The new dormmate's here.

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:33.860
Lin Honglang.

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:35.340
You're the newcomer?

00:18:36.688 --> 00:18:38.500
I'm not the most handsome guy here
anymore.

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:40.670
What's your name?

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:41.780
I'm Li Wu.

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:42.940
Gift?

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:44.230
You brought me a gift?

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:47.100
That's an interesting name.

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:48.300
My surname is Li.

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:49.340
Wu as in fog.

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:50.180
Fog, I see.

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:52.430
Please sit.

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:53.230
Have a sit.

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:54.070
Don't be shy.

00:18:54.977 --> 00:18:56.310
Once you step through this door,

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:58.020
we're all brothers from now on.

00:18:58.020 --> 00:18:58.670
Why do you always

00:18:58.670 --> 00:18:59.780
call everyone your brothers?

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:02.020
Shut up.

00:19:06.666 --> 00:19:08.288
We didn't mean to touch your things.

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:09.820
We were just curious about you.

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:10.911
We didn't take anything.

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:12.470
It's fine.

00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:16.020
Why are you alone?

00:19:16.066 --> 00:19:17.030
Where are your parents?

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:26.260
Why did you hit me?

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:27.780
It's his privacy. Don't pry.

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:29.780
What's wrong with me asking?

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:30.670
You wear glasses.

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:31.720
Can't you read the room?

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.580
- You're so insensitive.
- Can't you two be quiet?

00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:35.500
He hit me first.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:36.340
Are you sure?

00:19:36.377 --> 00:19:37.150
The new guy is here.

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:39.022
You're making a fool of yourself
in front of him.

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:41.340
You'll get used to it.

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:42.390
Well...

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:43.150
Hi.

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:44.300
I'm Ran Feichi.

00:19:44.444 --> 00:19:46.020
Fei as in flying, Chi as in galloping.

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:47.470
I'm Li Wu.

00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:48.430
My surname is Li.

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:49.270
Wu as in fog.

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:50.790
Sit.

00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:55.990
Li Wu,

00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:57.111
which class are you in?

00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:58.230
I don't know yet.

00:19:58.500 --> 00:19:59.630
The exam is this afternoon.

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:01.430
I'll explain to you.

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:03.150
Our grade

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:04.060
has six classes.

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:05.780
Students are assigned according to

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:06.620
their exam scores.

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:07.990
But Class One

00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:09.150
is different from

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:09.990
the other five.

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:11.780
It's the Rocket Class.

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:12.670
They're geniuses

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:14.260
who could've gone to university

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:15.422
but chose to repeat a year

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.910
to aim for prestigious universities
like Huaqing or Yan University. Super scary.

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:18.750
You'd better not go.

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:20.060
They'll grind you to dust.

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:23.740
Ran Feichi and I

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:24.820
are both in Class Three.

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:25.670
Lin Honglang

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:26.510
is in Class Four.

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:28.260
I'm not that ambitious.

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:29.800
I just want to get into any university.

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.580
Do your best this afternoon

00:20:32.711 --> 00:20:34.150
and try to get into Class Three.

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:35.230
Come join us.

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:36.620
Welcome.

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:41.100
(Rocket Class...)

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:55.940
Sister.

00:20:56.733 --> 00:20:57.950
You're done with the exam?

00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:58.790
How was it?

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:03.100
Didn't do well?

00:21:04.844 --> 00:21:05.910
Which class did you get?

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:08.030
Class Three.

00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:09.630
That's not bad.

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:12.870
It's not the best Rocket Class.

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:14.820
You'd been out of school.

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:16.740
And you just get your footing back now.

00:21:16.933 --> 00:21:18.511
Don't set the difficulty too great

00:21:18.555 --> 00:21:19.910
from the start.

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:24.310
Cheer up.

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:29.670
I went to the mall nearby

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:31.044
and bought you a digital watch.

00:21:34.555 --> 00:21:35.870
When you went for the exam,

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:36.820
I suddenly realized

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:38.470
you can't check the time on your phone

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:40.430
during exams or class.

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:41.270
You need a watch.

00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:47.577
I already bought it.
You're taking it whether you want it or not.

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:48.510
It's necessary.

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:54.630
You're not going to get awkward
about this again, right?

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:57.150
I'm not.

00:21:57.630 --> 00:21:58.470
Good.

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:00.340
The time is set.

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:01.630
Read the manual

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:02.820
when you get back.

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:06.100
I'm heading off.

00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:07.390
Take care of yourself.

00:22:07.466 --> 00:22:08.600
Call me if anything happens.

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:17.140
By the way,

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:18.780
a new mission for you.

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:20.540
You're too skinny.

00:22:20.644 --> 00:22:21.660
Put on five kilograms.

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:23.950
I'll try.

00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:48.530
♪Sunlight and breeze get tipsy♪

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:52.810
♪It stirs up my heart,
my thoughts are all over the place♪

00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:57.360
♪I didn't dare look into your eyes♪

00:22:57.890 --> 00:23:01.890
♪Afraid my secret would slip out♪

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:06.420
♪From the moment I first met you♪

00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:11.020
♪My heart lost its rhythm♪

00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:14.120
♪Time freezes♪

To be honest,

00:26:24.555 --> 00:26:26.600
among the managers
in the Branding Department,

00:26:26.644 --> 00:26:27.888

00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:28.750

You flatter me, Mr. Gu.

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:35.470
I heard Xiyue's project

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:36.670
has already started.

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:38.150
Yeah.

00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:38.990
It's not easy.

00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:41.060
But everything

00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:42.230
is going smoothly

00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:43.070
so far.

00:26:43.333 --> 00:26:44.310
You've all worked hard.

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:45.720
It's what we should do.

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:47.470
Wu Fu

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:48.310
is meticulous.

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:49.540
The follow-up work

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:50.500
is done extremely well.

00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:51.950
You're really

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:52.790
a perfect team.

00:26:55.150 --> 00:26:56.750
And now he's been promoted to director.

00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:57.900
From here on,

00:26:58.060 --> 00:26:59.300
you two need to work closely.

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:05.190
I don't quite follow.

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:07.500
Didn't he tell you?

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:11.540
Some time ago,

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:13.230
your health took a serious hit

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:14.150
because of work.

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:16.100
Wu Fu was very worried about you.

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:17.500
As a husband,

00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:18.550
it's right for him

00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:20.390
to take the director position

00:27:20.888 --> 00:27:22.311
and shoulder more pressure.

00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:27.020
You'll be partners from now on.

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:28.510
You'll support him.

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:29.710
This way,

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:30.670
your health

00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:31.510
won't get worse.

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:33.430
You're both young.

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:35.540
Family matters too.

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:44.180
She changed her...

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:48.300
He's a transfer student.

00:27:48.311 --> 00:27:49.580
He won't take much of your time.

00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:51.020
Just let him introduce himself.

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:52.580
Alright. Come in.

00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:53.420
Come on, Li Wu.

00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:57.470
Everyone,

00:27:57.740 --> 00:27:59.150
this is our new classmate.

00:27:59.288 --> 00:28:00.733
He's transferred from Yunfeng.

00:28:01.066 --> 00:28:03.111
You can tell everyone the rest yourself.

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:09.020
I... I'm...

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:11.860
Handsome.

00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:15.260
Cheng Rui,

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:15.910
come.

00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:16.750
Come here.

00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:18.150
You'll speak for him.

00:28:19.133 --> 00:28:20.470
I'll give you the chance. Come on.

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:24.340
Go on.

00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:28.150
Hello, everyone.

00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:28.990
I'm Li Wu.

00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:30.340
My surname is Li.

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:31.180
Wu as in fog.

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:34.260
I hope

00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:35.340
we all get along.

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:41.500
You're tall.

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:42.470
Sit in the last row.

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:54.500
Alright. Let's continue.

00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:56.510
Where's Yunfeng?

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:00.630
In Shengzhou.

00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:02.300
Then why are you

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:03.355
repeating the year here?

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:05.580
Look at the board.

00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:06.790
This is important.

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:08.740
This is a typical usage

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:10.740
of modal verbs

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:12.190
for the subjunctive mood.

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:13.390
Let's read the sentence.

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:15.710
Jenny should've kept her word.

00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:16.580
I wonder

00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:17.950
why she changed her mind.

00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:21.470
Leader Wu has such luck.

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:23.150
Every project he gets

00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:24.230
moves smoothly into launch,

00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:25.820
and the results are amazing.

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:27.060
You know what?

00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:28.740
The boss is over the moon.

00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:30.230
A reminder.

00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:31.950
Fu's been promoted.

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:32.780
Stop calling him

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:33.670
Leader Wu.

00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:34.580
He'll be upset.

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:36.150
He won't.

00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:37.950
Fu wouldn't mind something so small.

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:40.060
But honestly,

00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:41.710
it's enviable.

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:43.150
He's only thirty.

00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:44.933
At the age of thirty,
he's already at the peak.

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:47.910
I should work harder.

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:49.470
Maybe I can do the same.

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:50.630
First of all,

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:51.500
it depends on

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:53.630
whether you can marry a wife
as great as Jin.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.400
What's that supposed to mean?

00:29:56.390 --> 00:29:57.230
You don't know?

00:29:57.740 --> 00:29:59.390
When Fu first joined the company,

00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:00.955
Jin brought him onto a lot of projects.

00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:02.390
Her dad also gave him

00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:03.230
a lot of resources.

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:04.470
For real?

00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:06.340
I didn't know that.

00:30:10.577 --> 00:30:11.710
What are you doing here?

00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:14.540
Congrats on the promotion.

00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:19.910
Do you also think

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:21.540
I stole your credit?

00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:23.540
If you think

00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:24.540
what they said is wrong,

00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:26.630
why are you being so sensitive?

00:30:30.977 --> 00:30:32.100
About the divorce agreement,

00:30:32.911 --> 00:30:34.070
do you still want to talk?

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:38.340
Sure.

00:30:38.533 --> 00:30:39.860
Let's go somewhere else.

00:30:58.300 --> 00:30:59.260
Your coffees.

00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:02.180
This one is yours.

00:31:04.066 --> 00:31:05.100
Light roast Americano.

00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:11.580
I...

00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:13.155
Have you read the divorce agreement?

00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:18.030
Not yet.

00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:22.900
It's fine.

00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:24.540
I'll walk you through it.

00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:26.780
I had a lawyer review it.

00:31:26.822 --> 00:31:28.066
You can check it yourself.

00:31:28.910 --> 00:31:29.820
As for the major part,

00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:31.540
the apartment in Muyunli

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:32.666
is a premarital property.

00:31:32.777 --> 00:31:34.244
It has nothing to do with me.

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:36.060
The one I'm living in now,

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:37.300
I paid the down payment.

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:40.100
You probably

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:41.060
don't need it,

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:42.180
so I'm keeping it.

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:44.340
Of course,

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:45.580
if you want it,

00:31:45.866 --> 00:31:47.155
I'm fine with that too.

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:48.780
If the down payment

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:50.390
is too much to return at once,

00:31:50.666 --> 00:31:52.088
you can pay me in installments.

00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:54.230
And the cars,

00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:55.580
we have two.

00:31:55.622 --> 00:31:57.666
- Later...
- You're in such a rush to get divorced.

00:31:57.733 --> 00:31:59.300
Is there something you can't wait for?

00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:03.820
What do you mean?

00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:14.750
Jin.

00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:18.670
I know you've been hurt.

00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:20.950
I also have my own resentment.

00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:24.340
I really did try my best
in this relationship.

00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:29.740
You heard

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:30.911
what they said just now.

00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:33.470
My worth,

00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:34.900
my dignity,

00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:36.740
everything I've worked

00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:38.500
so hard for,

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:40.780
all of it comes down to
depending on you.

00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:42.710
I never denied you.

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:44.630
I need more than your approval.

00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:58.820
Think carefully.

00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:02.100
Have you actually been happy

00:33:03.022 --> 00:33:04.133
these past few months?

00:33:15.133 --> 00:33:16.866
I still have work to deal with.

00:33:16.933 --> 00:33:19.311
Reply to me as quickly as possible
after you read the agreement.

00:33:58.950 --> 00:33:59.790
Li Wu.

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:03.910
We're going to sleep.

00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:05.230
What about you?

00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:27.100
Stop studying.

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:27.940
Go to bed.

00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:38.540
Okay.

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:16.660
(Sister: Okay. You too.)

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:25.500
Li Wu.

00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:27.270
Look at you.

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:28.790
You're already absorbed in the code.

00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:30.580
I know you're the tech type,

00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:31.990
but you need breaks.

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:33.980
Come out with me.

00:35:34.488 --> 00:35:35.933
Let's meet the investors.

00:35:36.688 --> 00:35:38.990
I haven't solved the hardest part
of the new system yet.

00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:39.910
How can I talk to them?

00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:40.790
See?

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:42.350
That's the student mindset.

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:43.830
You know what?

00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:44.670
If you try to explain

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:45.700
how your system

00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:46.310
perfectly fits

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:48.100
their high-end neighborhoods and hotels,

00:35:48.133 --> 00:35:49.220
do you think they'd get that?

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:50.100
They won't.

00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:52.180
Sometimes, having good relationships

00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:53.910
works better than perfect tech.

00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:54.910
If we want

00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:56.220
to grow this business

00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:57.350
and expand the company,

00:35:57.377 --> 00:35:58.933
we need to work on the connections.

00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:00.830
Business is like war.

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:03.020
There are rules we need to play by.

00:36:03.266 --> 00:36:05.377
Anyway, you're not getting out
of tonight's dinner.

00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:07.060
Alright. Put it down.

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:08.470
Cheng Rui's already there.

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:09.750
He's waiting for us. Come on.

00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:10.830
Come on.

00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:16.020
Let's go.

00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:19.733
When we get there,
I'll do most of the talking.

00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:20.860
Relax.

00:36:23.830 --> 00:36:24.790
We're here.

00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:25.700
Sorry.

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:26.580
We're late.

00:36:26.830 --> 00:36:27.700
Let me introduce you.

00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:28.830
Li Wu,

00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:30.390
our tech director at Tongchen.

00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:31.430
Top student.

00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:32.500
His mentor overseas

00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:33.060
is a big name

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:34.220
in the field.

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:35.540
And this is

00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:36.620
Mr. Qin I told you about.

00:36:38.466 --> 00:36:39.620
Nice to meet you, Mr. Qin.

00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:40.460
You too.

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:41.980
Have a seat.

00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:43.060
Let's sit.

00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:46.590
Why are you here?

00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:48.020
I thought you hated these.

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:49.310
No choice.

00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:49.910
Yi forced me

00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:50.750
to come.

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:53.430
Sorry, we're late. Traffic was bad.

00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:54.220
Yeah.

00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:54.790
Well.

00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:55.430
Since I'm late,

00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:57.022
I'll drink three cups as punishment.

00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:06.140
We brought you fruit.

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:07.060
Remember to eat it.

00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:09.310
If you leave it in the fridge
too long, it'll dry out.

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:10.340
Alright.

00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:17.620
Wu came by the house recently

00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:18.790
to visit your dad and me.

00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:21.470
He said he just got back

00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:22.733
and wanted to visit us first.

00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:24.500
Have you met him yet?

00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:29.540
When was that?

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:31.270
Two weeks ago, right?

00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:32.900
About that.

00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:34.220
No matter what,

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:34.870
your dad and I

00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:35.540
are his elders

00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:36.620
who are tight with him.

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:38.660
What?

00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:39.750
You're not happy

00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:40.933
he came to see us first?

00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:44.310
Wu is a good boy.

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:46.060
Every holiday,

00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:48.220
he'd text us and send greetings

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:49.060
when he was overseas.

00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:50.580
This time,

00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:51.830
he brought a bunch of gifts.

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:54.140
He brought this

00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:55.540
for the two of us.

00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:57.350
And I made it

00:37:57.350 --> 00:37:58.190
for you.

00:38:03.790 --> 00:38:04.630
You never told me

00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:05.790
any of this.

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:07.580
Do you know

00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:08.870
how many times you go home?

00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:10.870
Every time

00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:12.390
we call, you just say two words,

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:13.230
"I'm busy."

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:15.630
You hang up before we can even talk.

00:38:15.688 --> 00:38:16.790
I never told you any of this?

00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:17.910
What could I say?

00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:20.830
I really have been busy.

00:38:22.177 --> 00:38:23.355
Wu didn't stay long.

00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:25.390
He said he's starting a business
with friends

00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:26.790
and has a lot to handle.

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:30.340
Children work hard

00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:31.870
on their careers.

00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:32.710
That's good.

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:34.540
I support that.

00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:48.790
Jin, come eat some fruit.

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:49.940
Okay.

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:54.600
Don't touch her things.

00:38:54.644 --> 00:38:56.100
She won't be able to find them later.

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:56.859
Look at this.

00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:58.580
She has a problem with
where she puts stuff.

00:38:58.580 --> 00:38:59.750
Look at those books

00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:01.660
and boxes.

00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:03.390
What's wrong with that?

00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:04.100
Jin,

00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:05.100
look at this room.

00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:06.580
It has plenty of space,

00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:07.950
and no one lives here.

00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:09.390
Just put it here,

00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:10.230
and it's done.

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:12.500
Look how spacious it is.

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:15.060
The wardrobe is empty.

00:39:15.350 --> 00:39:16.020
I think

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:16.860
it should go here.

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:19.220
Mom.

00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:20.060
Look.

00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:22.910
Don't move my stuff.

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:24.540
Mom.

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:27.470
I'll sort it out when I have time.

00:39:27.911 --> 00:39:29.977
If you put things away,
I won't be able to find them.

00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:32.870
So messy.

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:33.710
Come here.

00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:39.110
Have you met

00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:40.910
with Lu recently?

00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:43.710
What?

00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:46.020
Don't play dumb.

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:49.350
I really like

00:39:49.350 --> 00:39:50.390
Dr. Lu.

00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:52.870
Just give him a chance.

00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:55.270
Give him what chance?

00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:57.470
He never said he liked me.

00:39:59.955 --> 00:40:01.310
Every time he prescribes my meds,

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:03.140
he never hands them to me.

00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:04.990
Instead, he calls you out

00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:05.910
and hands them to you

00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:06.950
to pass on to me.

00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:09.020
It's so obvious.

00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:09.990
How do you not see it?

00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:11.700
There's nothing obvious.

00:40:12.350 --> 00:40:13.990
Mom, we're just friends.

00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:15.500
Don't overthink it.

00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:16.220
I overthink it?

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:17.733
You're not thinking about it at all.

00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:20.750
He's a neurologist.

00:40:21.310 --> 00:40:22.500
Such a decent job.

00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:24.140
And he's composed.

00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:26.100
Why won't you

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:27.100
give it a try?

00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:29.220
There's no why.

00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:30.910
Mom,

00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:31.790
don't rush it.

00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:33.180
We'll take things slowly, okay?

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:34.140
Take things slowly?

00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:35.422
Everything with you is slow.

00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:38.350
If you'd listened to me back then,

00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:39.500
I wouldn't have to

00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:40.350
chase after you

00:40:40.350 --> 00:40:41.390
every day now.

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:44.100
Give it another thought.

00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:45.430
Whoever you end up with,

00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:47.488
marriage still comes down
to the little things.

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:49.060
Alright.

00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:50.310
I'll take care of it.

00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:51.500
Don't worry.

00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:53.430
Let's go eat some fruit.

00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:54.630
Let's go.

00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:56.830
Put away whatever you don't need

00:40:56.830 --> 00:40:58.020
in the wardrobe.

00:40:58.020 --> 00:40:59.888
- Tidy up the books.
- Let's eat some fruit.

00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:07.620
How was it?

00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:08.460
Had fun?

00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:10.350
I had so much fun.

00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:11.700
If these fellows

00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:12.620
don't pay up,

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:13.270
I'll block

00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:14.733
their office entrance tomorrow.

00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:19.270
It's late.

00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:20.511
You guys should go home.

00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:21.990
Hang on.

00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:22.980
Mr. Li,

00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:25.220
I'm not done talking to you.

00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:27.270
We can talk tomorrow.

00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:28.180
I'm exhausted.

00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:29.020
No.

00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:30.430
I have to say

00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:31.533
what I want to say today.

00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:32.700
Mr. Li,

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:33.540
we're running

00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:34.750
a company here.

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:36.950
What's a company?

00:41:37.088 --> 00:41:38.310
A place that feeds people

00:41:38.310 --> 00:41:41.060
and makes a profit, right?

00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:43.180
We're not some national
research institute

00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:45.020
or a university lab.

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:46.910
We need to make money.

00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:48.590
Let me tell you this.

00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:51.390
If I hadn't been

00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:52.390
keeping our cash flow,

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:54.220
Tongchen wouldn't be where it is today.

00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:55.910
Yes.

00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:58.990
You're the most important in Tongchen.
We can't function without you.

00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:00.180
That's not what I meant.

00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:00.950
Look.

00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:01.620
The car is here.

00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:02.460
Get in.

00:42:02.830 --> 00:42:03.670
Get in.

00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:05.060
Cheng Rui, I'm not drunk, am I?

00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:06.700
No. There's no way you'd get drunk.

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:07.540
I really... I...

00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:09.140
Get in the car.

00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:10.777
Li Wu, I'm doing this for your own good.

00:42:10.830 --> 00:42:11.933
I'll send you home.

00:42:11.955 --> 00:42:12.644
Off you go.

00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:14.660
You all go home early.

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:18.190
It's all for Li Wu.

00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:19.390
Get home early.

00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:20.230
Careful.

00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:23.350
Careful.

00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:25.060
Bye-bye.

00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:45.540
Li Wu!

00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:46.830
Li Wu, I...

00:42:54.270 --> 00:42:55.270
Incorrect password.

00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:02.060
Incorrect password.

00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:17.500
Incorrect password.

00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:22.390
