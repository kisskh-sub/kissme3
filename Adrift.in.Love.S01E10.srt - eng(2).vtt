[Let me die]

00:02:13.203 --> 00:02:17.008
[Episode 10: Does the truth bring us closer?]

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:20.773
There's seafood salad here.

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:22.976
Isn't it beautiful?

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:24.352
You can see the blue sky from the ceiling.

00:02:24.352 --> 00:02:25.937
I'm going to the restroom.

00:02:25.937 --> 00:02:27.522
Sure, no problem.

00:02:27.522 --> 00:02:30.233
Do you want iced coffee?

00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:32.576
I always order three cups when I'm here.

00:02:34.723 --> 00:02:38.733
[Let's go elsewhere.
See you at the parking lot.]

00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:48.877
Ms. Zhou.

00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:51.004
What a coincidence. You're eating here too?

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:52.881
Yes, I just finished.

00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:55.891
I'll get going. Take your time.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.093
Xiao Qi.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.757
Are you okay?

00:03:35.757 --> 00:03:38.176
- What's wrong?
- I just met someone from work.

00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:40.070
Let's go.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.890
There's no need to overreact.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.893
We didn't do anything intimate.

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:49.938
That person is the one
who wants to take me down.

00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:53.233
I'm afraid he'll make up stories
to mess with me if he sees us alone.

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:56.402
We're just friends of the opposite sex.

00:03:56.402 --> 00:03:57.907
We're just having a meal.

00:03:57.907 --> 00:03:59.830
What story can he make up?

00:04:01.115 --> 00:04:03.000
Are you angry?

00:04:07.705 --> 00:04:10.250
I just think we came all this way here.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.134
Let's just relax.

00:04:13.378 --> 00:04:16.506
Now that you've become the chairman,

00:04:16.506 --> 00:04:18.633
must we do everything in secret?

00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:22.978
I don't want to be like this either,
but what can I do?

00:04:23.846 --> 00:04:26.982
Let's go, okay? Come on.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.815
- What's wrong?
- It hurts.

00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:35.574
Let me help you to the car.

00:04:36.901 --> 00:04:38.869
This is so sudden.

00:04:40.488 --> 00:04:43.074
The fetus looks fine for now.

00:04:43.074 --> 00:04:44.993
But the placenta isn't stable yet.

00:04:44.993 --> 00:04:46.703
So, we've given you a progesterone injection.

00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:48.288
You'll have to stay in the hospital
for further observation.

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:50.047
Thank you.

00:05:08.933 --> 00:05:10.651
I'm sorry.

00:05:12.812 --> 00:05:14.555
I'm too selfish.

00:05:16.774 --> 00:05:18.909
Why don't I resign as chairwoman,

00:05:19.694 --> 00:05:21.662
and we run away?

00:05:33.291 --> 00:05:35.092
Hang in there.

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:41.598
One day, the three of us
can be together openly.

00:05:46.554 --> 00:05:48.355
Xiao Qi.

00:05:51.642 --> 00:05:53.235
Dr. Gu.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.731
Are you all right?

00:05:56.731 --> 00:05:58.191
I'm fine.

00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:00.568
I have all the documents.
I'll get you admitted later.

00:06:00.568 --> 00:06:02.445
Thank you.

00:06:02.445 --> 00:06:04.614
It happened so suddenly,
and I was at the restaurant.

00:06:04.614 --> 00:06:06.741
So, I rushed her to this hospital.

00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:08.910
She's all yours now.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.495
Thank you, Dr. Gu.

00:06:10.495 --> 00:06:12.330
Get some rest. I'll get going.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.881
Okay.

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:16.091
Thank you.

00:06:29.972 --> 00:06:33.559
- Hello.
- Hello, do you have an appointment?

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:35.728
I'm sorry, I don't have an appointment.

00:06:35.728 --> 00:06:39.744
But please tell Dr. Gu
I'm from New Zealand.

00:06:39.744 --> 00:06:40.942
My name is Wei Da Wei.

00:06:40.942 --> 00:06:43.076
I'm Yue Jiao's fiancé.

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:47.698
Have some water.

00:06:47.698 --> 00:06:48.700
Here's a glass.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.451
Thank you.

00:06:50.451 --> 00:06:53.079
Check. Okay, next.

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:55.540
It's your turn.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.792
Be good and eat them.

00:06:57.792 --> 00:06:59.794
Let's check.

00:06:59.794 --> 00:07:01.337
Good, very good.

00:07:01.337 --> 00:07:02.880
Next.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.556
Here you go.

00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:10.093
Okay.

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:17.152
Actually, I'm not sure
if I'm Yue Jiao's fiancé.

00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:23.401
A few days after she accepted
my proposal, my younger sister...

00:07:23.401 --> 00:07:25.570
She was in our kitchen.

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:27.871
My sister found that she slit her wrists.

00:07:30.241 --> 00:07:33.578
Luckily, she didn't cut her aorta.

00:07:33.578 --> 00:07:36.539
When she was in the hospital,

00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:40.168
she wouldn't tell us anything.

00:07:40.168 --> 00:07:43.754
When she finally did, she told me

00:07:43.754 --> 00:07:45.965
she wanted to go back to Taiwan.

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:47.891
She insisted.

00:07:49.427 --> 00:07:51.520
I had to let her come back.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:56.350
But I couldn't contact her after she came back.

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:58.151
I was worried.

00:07:58.769 --> 00:08:01.655
So, I followed her back to Taiwan.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.326
Dr. Gu.

00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:10.789
Do you know where Yue Jiao is?

00:08:34.555 --> 00:08:37.600
Yue Jiao, you have a visitor.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.185
Is it Dr. Gu?

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:41.278
Yes, it's Dr. Gu.

00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:44.023
I'll be right there.

00:08:44.023 --> 00:08:45.782
Okay.

00:09:08.172 --> 00:09:10.967
Yue Jiao's delusions

00:09:10.967 --> 00:09:14.804
have aggravated her violent
and self-harm tendencies.

00:09:14.804 --> 00:09:17.181
Consequently, her mood swings
are also more pronounced.

00:09:17.181 --> 00:09:19.566
You need to be prepared.

00:09:23.354 --> 00:09:25.280
Yue Jiao and I...

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:28.554
were childhood neighbors.

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:31.487
She was my first love.

00:09:32.738 --> 00:09:35.866
After my family immigrated to New Zealand,

00:09:35.866 --> 00:09:38.119
we lost touch.

00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:40.955
But I never forgot her.

00:09:40.955 --> 00:09:45.126
Until I met her at the airport a while ago.

00:09:45.126 --> 00:09:47.302
She was very sad then.

00:09:48.337 --> 00:09:51.132
So sad that she wanted to die.

00:09:51.132 --> 00:09:53.384
I brought her to New Zealand.

00:09:53.384 --> 00:09:55.553
Yue Jiao told me...

00:09:55.553 --> 00:09:58.146
you two had agreed to leave together,

00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:02.067
but you ditched her.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:09.783
Yue Jiao.

00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:14.447
Why did you bring him here?

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:15.945
He came all the way back to see you.

00:10:15.945 --> 00:10:18.159
He's worried about you.

00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:21.128
I'll let you two talk.

00:10:22.246 --> 00:10:23.831
If it's because I accepted his proposal

00:10:23.831 --> 00:10:25.416
- I'm Dr. Gu. Please open the door.
- and you won't forgive me,

00:10:25.416 --> 00:10:27.543
I'll apologize to you.

00:10:27.543 --> 00:10:29.754
If we can go back to how we were,

00:10:29.754 --> 00:10:32.298
I can destroy the recording.

00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:34.425
I can get the money back, too.

00:10:34.425 --> 00:10:36.135
I can change everything
you don't like about me.

00:10:36.135 --> 00:10:38.812
I mean it! Trust me!

00:10:39.722 --> 00:10:41.474
Mr. Wei wants to take you back to New Zealand.

00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:43.851
I think the environment there
would be better for you.

00:10:43.851 --> 00:10:45.561
You should really think about it.

00:10:45.561 --> 00:10:48.397
If you agree, I'll help you
appeal to Chief Zhu.

00:10:48.397 --> 00:10:50.316
Don't try to pawn me off on him!

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:51.901
You might as well just let me die.

00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:54.112
Don't be so extreme in your thoughts.

00:10:54.112 --> 00:10:55.696
We're doing this for your own good.

00:10:55.696 --> 00:10:58.240
No, I don't want that!

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.535
Gu Hou Ze, don't leave me!

00:11:01.535 --> 00:11:03.913
Come back! Just let me die!

00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:04.914
Gu Hou Ze!

00:11:04.914 --> 00:11:06.624
Yue Jiao.

00:11:06.624 --> 00:11:08.417
Let's go back to New Zealand, okay?

00:11:08.417 --> 00:11:11.796
I don't want to go to New Zealand with you!

00:11:11.796 --> 00:11:13.714
I said I'd take care of you forever.

00:11:13.714 --> 00:11:15.508
You promised to marry me, remember?

00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:17.426
I was in a bad mood then
and talking nonsense.

00:11:17.426 --> 00:11:18.636
Why did you believe me?

00:11:18.636 --> 00:11:21.271
Are you all sick?

00:11:50.584 --> 00:11:51.794
Yi Fu.

00:11:51.794 --> 00:11:53.087
Still at the company at this hour?

00:11:53.087 --> 00:11:54.630
All the employees have gone home.

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:57.091
Yet, the chairman is alone in the office.

00:11:57.091 --> 00:11:59.051
Now, you know.

00:11:59.051 --> 00:12:02.012
It's harder to be a boss than an employee.

00:12:02.012 --> 00:12:03.848
They're just salary men.

00:12:03.848 --> 00:12:06.767
No need to risk their lives for your work.

00:12:06.767 --> 00:12:08.777
Then why did you push me into it?

00:12:09.437 --> 00:12:11.731
I bought your favorite tofu pudding.

00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:13.532
Want to eat some first?

00:12:17.027 --> 00:12:19.071
I didn't force you this time.

00:12:19.071 --> 00:12:21.831
You're the one who wants to come back.

00:12:22.992 --> 00:12:25.161
What's wrong?

00:12:25.161 --> 00:12:28.247
You've seen how dangerous the world can be.

00:12:28.247 --> 00:12:30.173
Finally content?

00:12:31.208 --> 00:12:33.633
I'll report back to the office tomorrow.

00:12:33.633 --> 00:12:37.298
Chairwoman, is there anything
you need me to do?

00:12:37.298 --> 00:12:41.560
You'll be in charge
of the project with Chaomai.

00:12:42.428 --> 00:12:45.014
Your uncle should have
told you all the details.

00:12:45.014 --> 00:12:47.308
- Okay.
- As long as it makes money,

00:12:47.308 --> 00:12:50.694
I won't interfere with whatever you do.

00:12:51.395 --> 00:12:54.531
Their contact person is Lin Feng Hua.

00:12:55.566 --> 00:12:57.651
You stood her up last time.

00:12:57.651 --> 00:12:59.570
You'd better buy her a gift to apologize first.

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:01.655
And talk to her, too.

00:13:01.655 --> 00:13:03.199
Again?

00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:05.075
Why do I feel like we're going in circles?

00:13:05.075 --> 00:13:07.244
I'm not forcing you to
go on a blind date this time.

00:13:07.244 --> 00:13:09.205
Just do your job well.

00:13:09.205 --> 00:13:13.709
As for the rest,
just let nature take its course.

00:13:13.709 --> 00:13:15.844
Let nature take its course?

00:13:17.296 --> 00:13:20.213
Why does that sound like a conspiracy?

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.303
I don't care what you think.

00:13:24.303 --> 00:13:27.389
If your relationship with Pan Xin Tong
is strong enough,

00:13:27.389 --> 00:13:31.018
you don't have to worry that
I'll force you and Lin Feng Hua together.

00:13:31.018 --> 00:13:32.019
Of course.

00:13:32.019 --> 00:13:35.905
Lin Feng Hua and I will only talk
about work, not feelings.

00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:40.694
Chief Secretary Pan.

00:13:40.694 --> 00:13:42.307
This was sent from somewhere unknown.

00:13:42.307 --> 00:13:44.698
It just says it's for the chairman.

00:13:44.698 --> 00:13:46.791
Okay, thank you.

00:14:09.223 --> 00:14:12.184
This letter reports that Vice President Qian
received kickbacks from vendors.

00:14:12.184 --> 00:14:14.770
He wants them to transfer the money
to Xiao Ting Yun's account.

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:17.898
But the company name, date, and numbers on it,

00:14:17.898 --> 00:14:20.693
and Xiao Ting Yun's bank account
seem somewhat credible.

00:14:20.693 --> 00:14:23.161
I don't think it's malicious slander.

00:14:23.779 --> 00:14:26.031
She treats him as her personal piggy bank.

00:14:26.031 --> 00:14:27.992
From what I know about the Qian family,

00:14:27.992 --> 00:14:29.702
this sounds like something he would do.

00:14:29.702 --> 00:14:30.703
Exactly.

00:14:30.703 --> 00:14:33.747
He used to make things difficult for me

00:14:33.747 --> 00:14:35.374
because I wouldn't accompany him
to entertain clients at night.

00:14:35.374 --> 00:14:38.460
If we investigate this thoroughly,
we'll definitely find something.

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:42.464
Before the next board election,
I must achieve some results.

00:14:42.464 --> 00:14:44.091
Otherwise, Chairman Wu won't support me.

00:14:44.091 --> 00:14:45.759
Should we ask the vendors?

00:14:45.759 --> 00:14:46.886
No.

00:14:46.886 --> 00:14:49.763
I don't think we have
any evidence to act rashly.

00:14:49.763 --> 00:14:52.023
We'll only alert them.

00:14:55.644 --> 00:14:57.521
I have people in the Finance Department.

00:14:57.521 --> 00:14:59.398
I can ask them to investigate

00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:02.610
the prices and quality
of supplier purchases over the past year.

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:04.528
We can compare them with market prices.

00:15:04.528 --> 00:15:07.531
See if there are any inflated or false reports.

00:15:07.531 --> 00:15:09.617
I've also confirmed with the IT Department.

00:15:09.617 --> 00:15:11.785
You can use your authority
as chairman to investigate

00:15:11.785 --> 00:15:14.041
the emails between them and the vendors.

00:15:14.041 --> 00:15:15.918
Should we check them?

00:15:15.918 --> 00:15:18.295
Sure, let's try everything.

00:15:18.295 --> 00:15:19.888
Let's get him.

00:15:29.139 --> 00:15:31.308
Are you knitting?

00:15:31.308 --> 00:15:32.726
Chief.

00:15:32.726 --> 00:15:35.229
The head nurse said
you had something to tell me.

00:15:35.229 --> 00:15:36.605
Chief.

00:15:36.605 --> 00:15:38.899
I've figured some things out.

00:15:38.899 --> 00:15:40.150
Really?

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:44.822
I shouldn't have trusted
those wild thoughts in my head.

00:15:44.822 --> 00:15:48.367
I should have believed Dr. Gu.

00:15:48.367 --> 00:15:50.752
I should have listened to him more.

00:15:51.704 --> 00:15:53.497
That's very good.

00:15:53.497 --> 00:15:56.208
What did you listen to him about?

00:15:56.208 --> 00:15:59.879
Ms. Zhou is just Dr. Gu's patient.

00:15:59.879 --> 00:16:02.590
All that talk about plotting
for money and murder,

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:06.017
it was all just delusions in my head.

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:09.597
That's very good.

00:16:09.597 --> 00:16:11.390
If you keep making progress like this,

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:14.067
you might be discharged soon.

00:16:15.519 --> 00:16:18.063
I'll let you take a leave this weekend.

00:16:18.063 --> 00:16:20.865
Ask your fiancé to take you out.

00:16:22.276 --> 00:16:24.153
Chief.

00:16:24.153 --> 00:16:27.573
I only accepted his proposal

00:16:27.573 --> 00:16:29.825
because I was in a very bad state.

00:16:29.825 --> 00:16:32.168
I actually regret it now.

00:16:33.287 --> 00:16:34.997
How about this?

00:16:34.997 --> 00:16:38.250
Please call Dr. Gu for me.

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:41.003
Ask him to take me out for a walk.

00:16:41.003 --> 00:16:44.048
I want to hear more of what he says.

00:16:44.048 --> 00:16:46.683
That should help me recover faster, right?

00:16:47.343 --> 00:16:50.262
Okay.

00:16:50.262 --> 00:16:52.063
Thank you.

00:17:29.718 --> 00:17:31.167
Excuse me...

00:17:31.167 --> 00:17:33.347
[Chaomai]

00:17:33.347 --> 00:17:35.391
Is there still no response
from Vice President Lin Feng Hua?

00:17:35.391 --> 00:17:37.267
No.

00:17:37.267 --> 00:17:40.354
No, as in no one is picking up, or...

00:17:40.354 --> 00:17:42.363
No means no.

00:17:45.442 --> 00:17:46.910
You can be honest with me.

00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:48.821
I won't tell her.

00:17:48.821 --> 00:17:50.155
Honestly, it's just...

00:17:50.155 --> 00:17:52.533
The Vice President told me to make you wait

00:17:52.533 --> 00:17:54.709
and to ignore you.

00:17:55.911 --> 00:17:57.629
Okay, I'll wait.

00:17:58.288 --> 00:18:00.582
May I ask where the restroom is?

00:18:00.582 --> 00:18:02.383
Over there.

00:18:03.043 --> 00:18:04.677
Goodbye, Vice President.

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.312
Hey...

00:18:14.972 --> 00:18:16.606
I'm sorry.

00:18:24.314 --> 00:18:27.951
You're still mad that
I was late for the blind date.

00:18:30.154 --> 00:18:31.572
Let me make this clear.

00:18:31.572 --> 00:18:33.407
First of all, it wasn't a blind date.

00:18:33.407 --> 00:18:35.743
I was forced to have dinner with you.

00:18:35.743 --> 00:18:37.453
Secondly, you weren't late.

00:18:37.453 --> 00:18:39.379
You didn't show up at all.

00:18:44.668 --> 00:18:46.837
I'm sorry.

00:18:46.837 --> 00:18:48.255
This is for you.

00:18:48.255 --> 00:18:49.848
No, thanks.

00:18:59.183 --> 00:19:00.726
How did this happen?

00:19:03.602 --> 00:19:05.564
- Hello?
- Hello?

00:19:05.564 --> 00:19:07.441
What's wrong with the elevator?

00:19:07.441 --> 00:19:09.526
I'm sorry, the elevator broke down.

00:19:09.526 --> 00:19:10.986
We're contacting the manufacturer.

00:19:10.986 --> 00:19:13.997
Please bear with it for now. Thank you.

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:17.125
How long do I have to bear with this?

00:19:31.381 --> 00:19:34.968
What's wrong with you? Are you claustrophobic?

00:19:34.968 --> 00:19:37.854
No, I need to pee.

00:19:47.439 --> 00:19:49.233
Stop messing around.

00:19:49.233 --> 00:19:51.026
I'm really going to pee.

00:19:51.026 --> 00:19:52.194
Go ahead and pee.

00:19:52.194 --> 00:19:53.779
If you do, we'll be even.

00:19:53.779 --> 00:19:56.198
I'll talk to you all you want when we get out.

00:19:56.198 --> 00:19:57.199
Are you serious?

00:19:57.199 --> 00:19:59.785
So? Do we have a deal?

00:19:59.785 --> 00:20:00.911
No.

00:20:00.911 --> 00:20:04.456
I'd rather die than be humiliated.

00:20:04.456 --> 00:20:07.425
This is so boring. It's not fun at all.

00:20:12.589 --> 00:20:14.182
What did you give me?

00:20:19.805 --> 00:20:21.140
How about this?

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.399
Peeing in this counts.

00:20:48.375 --> 00:20:50.677
It's a good deal.

00:20:57.885 --> 00:20:59.469
Stop laughing.

00:20:59.469 --> 00:21:01.430
You've ruined my reputation.

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:03.682
You're the one who ruined my bag
that cost over a hundred grand.

00:21:03.682 --> 00:21:05.225
I can't believe you actually peed.

00:21:05.225 --> 00:21:07.436
If you dare tell anyone, I'll...

00:21:07.436 --> 00:21:10.284
What? Kill me to silence me?

00:21:12.191 --> 00:21:13.524
I've agreed to all your conditions.

00:21:13.524 --> 00:21:14.943
Let's talk business.

00:21:14.943 --> 00:21:17.196
I asked my secretary to send you the proposal.

00:21:17.196 --> 00:21:19.031
What do you think?

00:21:19.031 --> 00:21:20.157
I'll be frank with you.

00:21:20.157 --> 00:21:23.410
All your proposals are based
on the concept of Sinuobisi.

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:25.621
Which plan is profitable for Chaomai?

00:21:25.621 --> 00:21:28.172
That's why it's hard for us to work together.

00:21:35.172 --> 00:21:36.757
I already peed.

00:21:36.757 --> 00:21:39.301
Are you messing with me?

00:21:39.301 --> 00:21:40.893
Yes.

00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:44.056
I agree with you.

00:21:44.056 --> 00:21:47.893
Two companies with different positions
don't have to cooperate.

00:21:47.893 --> 00:21:49.686
Let's put the proposal aside for now.

00:21:49.686 --> 00:21:51.855
What if we combine
the resources of both companies

00:21:51.855 --> 00:21:54.365
to create a new business model?

00:21:57.236 --> 00:21:58.352
I'm starving from laughing.

00:21:58.352 --> 00:21:59.871
Let's talk while we eat.

00:22:01.903 --> 00:22:04.205
You're not going to tell me
to eat shit, are you?

00:22:05.741 --> 00:22:08.292
I heard that.

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:18.295
Do you remember what time
you need to be back today?

00:22:18.295 --> 00:22:20.464
- Six o'clock.
- Yes, that's great.

00:22:20.464 --> 00:22:21.548
Here.

00:22:21.548 --> 00:22:23.724
- Thank you.
- Have fun.

00:22:24.801 --> 00:22:26.519
Dr. Gu.

00:22:27.554 --> 00:22:29.689
I have to be back by six o'clock.

00:22:40.817 --> 00:22:43.119
Chief Zhu said you've thought
everything through.

00:22:44.321 --> 00:22:48.249
I have, I've thought everything through.

00:22:49.576 --> 00:22:51.912
What do you want?

00:22:51.912 --> 00:22:54.289
What do you want?

00:22:54.289 --> 00:22:57.793
You're not really going to keep me
locked up in there, are you?

00:22:57.793 --> 00:22:59.044
No.

00:22:59.044 --> 00:23:01.512
We'll let you out when you're better.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:11.556
I've thought a lot during this time.

00:23:11.556 --> 00:23:13.983
If I were you,

00:23:14.601 --> 00:23:18.196
I really wouldn't be able
to let Fan Yue Jiao go.

00:23:18.855 --> 00:23:21.108
Think about it.

00:23:21.108 --> 00:23:25.737
Fan Yue Jiao sacrificed so much for Gu Hou Ze.

00:23:25.737 --> 00:23:30.617
She gave her life and everything to Gu Hou Ze.

00:23:30.617 --> 00:23:34.121
In the end, Gu Hou Ze was a two-timer.

00:23:34.121 --> 00:23:36.456
He dumped Fan Yue Jiao.

00:23:36.456 --> 00:23:40.168
If Fan Yue Jiao really killed herself,

00:23:40.168 --> 00:23:42.094
what should Gu Hou Ze do?

00:23:46.758 --> 00:23:48.677
You know our problems.

00:23:48.677 --> 00:23:53.022
- We tried to talk about it.
- You're the problem, not me.

00:23:57.394 --> 00:23:59.855
You've hated your dad all your life.

00:23:59.855 --> 00:24:03.532
But now you're doing
the same thing as your dad.

00:24:05.068 --> 00:24:08.120
Can you accept this version of yourself?

00:24:11.658 --> 00:24:14.202
It's so good to be out.

00:24:14.202 --> 00:24:16.671
I feel so refreshed.

00:24:17.831 --> 00:24:19.674
It's so beautiful.

00:24:28.633 --> 00:24:31.435
Check the background of this company for me.

00:24:32.804 --> 00:24:36.308
If it's reliable, just follow the usual steps.

00:24:36.308 --> 00:24:37.566
Okay.

00:24:41.521 --> 00:24:42.689
By the way,

00:24:42.689 --> 00:24:45.025
Fengcai Guoji's money
has been wired to my account.

00:24:45.025 --> 00:24:46.276
I'll withdraw it for you.

00:24:46.276 --> 00:24:48.953
There's no need to rush. Take your time.

00:24:50.572 --> 00:24:52.574
Aren't you afraid I'll run away?

00:24:52.574 --> 00:24:54.208
I'm not afraid.

00:24:55.243 --> 00:24:58.045
I can only pursue you if you run away.

00:25:09.633 --> 00:25:11.767
You can sit wherever you want.

00:25:24.606 --> 00:25:26.608
The company has so many suppliers.

00:25:26.608 --> 00:25:28.271
Since Qian Xiao An has been receiving rebates,

00:25:28.271 --> 00:25:30.369
there must be more than one or two.

00:25:33.698 --> 00:25:34.783
Do you think Xiao Ting Yun

00:25:34.783 --> 00:25:38.328
has met with everyone
behind those wire transfers?

00:25:38.328 --> 00:25:40.247
You mean...

00:25:40.247 --> 00:25:42.123
Do you want to bet?

00:25:42.123 --> 00:25:43.708
I bet she hasn't.

00:25:43.708 --> 00:25:46.336
You can set up a meeting with them
under Xiao Ting Yun's name.

00:25:46.336 --> 00:25:48.588
Tell them you didn't receive
this month's payment.

00:25:48.588 --> 00:25:51.182
Ask them to provide a copy
of the wire transfer receipt.

00:25:58.223 --> 00:25:59.815
Mrs. Hong.

00:26:04.854 --> 00:26:06.530
Secretary Xiao?

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:08.905
Yes.

00:26:08.905 --> 00:26:10.610
Please have a seat.

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:12.737
I'm sorry for making you come here.

00:26:12.737 --> 00:26:14.030
Don't say that.

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:16.283
We've been friends for a long time.

00:26:16.283 --> 00:26:19.369
This is the receipt you asked for on the phone.

00:26:19.369 --> 00:26:21.788
It's for this month.

00:26:21.788 --> 00:26:23.081
Let me check.

00:26:23.081 --> 00:26:24.715
Take a look.

00:26:35.468 --> 00:26:37.695
I feel great!

00:26:48.982 --> 00:26:51.985
We've always wanted to drive to that hill.

00:26:51.985 --> 00:26:54.286
We can see the sea from there.

00:26:55.614 --> 00:26:57.282
Yes.

00:26:57.282 --> 00:27:00.042
But why didn't we make it?

00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:08.551
It would've been nice
to die here six years ago.

00:27:10.086 --> 00:27:13.264
Suicide by love. Romantic.

00:27:16.217 --> 00:27:18.727
Can we not talk about that again?

00:27:22.682 --> 00:27:24.650
Push me off.

00:27:27.354 --> 00:27:30.072
Seriously, push me off.

00:27:31.524 --> 00:27:33.068
What are you talking about?

00:27:33.068 --> 00:27:35.327
I love suicide anyway.

00:27:36.279 --> 00:27:38.907
Just push me off.

00:27:38.907 --> 00:27:40.784
No one will suspect you.

00:27:40.784 --> 00:27:42.251
I mean it.

00:27:44.287 --> 00:27:47.248
- Let's go back.
- Push me off and let me die.

00:27:47.248 --> 00:27:48.333
Fan Yue Jiao!

00:27:48.333 --> 00:27:49.709
- I mean it.
- Don't be like this.

00:27:49.709 --> 00:27:51.711
Let me die. I'm in pain.

00:27:51.711 --> 00:27:52.713
Let go.

00:27:52.713 --> 00:27:55.298
Just like when we helped your mom.

00:27:55.298 --> 00:27:56.716
You never grew up.

00:27:56.716 --> 00:27:58.134
You still don't dare to do it.
[Let me die]

00:27:58.134 --> 00:28:02.597
- No.
- Please do it.

00:28:02.597 --> 00:28:04.808
- That wasn't me.
- You and I will be free.

00:28:04.808 --> 00:28:05.892
I mean it.

00:28:05.892 --> 00:28:09.904
Push me down. I know you can do it, Gu Hou Ze.

00:28:10.605 --> 00:28:12.732
- You can!
- It wasn't me.

00:28:12.732 --> 00:28:15.527
- It wasn't me.
- Do it.

00:28:15.527 --> 00:28:17.369
Gu Hou Ze!

00:28:28.081 --> 00:28:30.132
Are you okay?

00:28:32.001 --> 00:28:34.879
It's all right, don't be afraid.

00:28:34.879 --> 00:28:37.014
Don't be afraid.

00:28:38.091 --> 00:28:40.093
Take a deep breath.

00:28:40.093 --> 00:28:43.430
Breathe in. Breathe in.

00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:45.314
It's all right.

00:30:41.256 --> 00:30:42.924
Hello?

00:30:42.924 --> 00:30:44.759
I'm at the nursing home's parking lot.

00:30:44.759 --> 00:30:47.971
I'm not feeling well. Can you pick me up?

00:30:47.971 --> 00:30:50.564
Okay, wait for me. I'll be right there.

00:31:39.772 --> 00:31:42.700
Did something happen with Fan Yue Jiao today?

00:31:43.985 --> 00:31:45.778
It's nothing.

00:31:45.778 --> 00:31:47.697
Are you sure?

00:31:47.697 --> 00:31:49.581
You scared me.

00:31:50.658 --> 00:31:53.453
It was just a panic attack.

00:31:53.453 --> 00:31:55.663
I'm fine now that it's over.

00:31:55.663 --> 00:31:57.589
You get panic attacks?

00:32:00.793 --> 00:32:05.347
Can you tell me what happened
and what Fan Yue Jiao did to you?

00:32:08.927 --> 00:32:10.644
I'm really fine.

00:32:12.597 --> 00:32:14.690
Can we stop talking about this?

00:32:30.615 --> 00:32:32.416
I love you.

00:32:34.118 --> 00:32:35.794
Do you love me?

00:32:39.165 --> 00:32:41.258
Can't you say it?

00:32:43.878 --> 00:32:47.639
Why can't I get an answer
when I know you love me?

00:32:48.591 --> 00:32:50.976
This is the distance between us.

00:32:58.893 --> 00:33:01.688
I don't understand you at all.

00:33:01.688 --> 00:33:04.198
I don't know what you're thinking.

00:33:05.316 --> 00:33:07.193
Even if I want to get close to you,

00:33:07.193 --> 00:33:09.286
I have no direction.

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:13.916
Did I cross the line?

00:33:15.201 --> 00:33:17.537
If I did, I'm sorry.

00:33:17.537 --> 00:33:19.831
I didn't mean to pry into your privacy.

00:33:19.831 --> 00:33:23.467
I know even if two people love each other,
they have their own secrets.

00:33:24.794 --> 00:33:27.588
You and Fan Yue Jiao have a past.

00:33:27.588 --> 00:33:29.424
Your past.

00:33:29.424 --> 00:33:31.551
I don't want to care.

00:33:31.551 --> 00:33:33.936
But she really gets to me.

00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:37.940
She makes me uncomfortable.

00:33:40.101 --> 00:33:42.653
I don't want you to be a stranger.

00:33:44.814 --> 00:33:46.740
I don't want to lose you.

00:33:47.775 --> 00:33:50.702
Can you tell me what happened?

00:33:59.287 --> 00:34:01.547
I'm a murderer.

00:34:46.793 --> 00:34:48.510
Do it.

00:34:49.837 --> 00:34:51.889
Once you're free,

00:34:52.673 --> 00:34:54.641
your mom will be free, too.

00:35:14.362 --> 00:35:16.163
It's okay.

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:44.232
I killed my mom.

00:35:50.815 --> 00:35:52.574
She's just like my mom.

00:35:55.695 --> 00:35:57.537
She wants me to kill her.

00:35:59.532 --> 00:36:02.417
They both like it when I
put them out of their misery.

00:36:10.293 --> 00:36:12.511
But who's going to put me out of my misery?

00:36:26.475 --> 00:36:29.486
It's okay.

00:37:26.285 --> 00:37:28.962
Sir, follow that car.

00:38:03.739 --> 00:38:05.957
Sir, pull over up ahead.

00:38:31.017 --> 00:38:32.893
Yue Jiao, you have a visitor.

00:38:32.893 --> 00:38:36.238
A friend named Zhou Xiao Qi.

00:38:37.773 --> 00:38:39.066
Tell her to wait.

00:38:39.066 --> 00:38:40.367
Okay.

00:39:21.108 --> 00:39:23.903
What brings you here?

00:39:23.903 --> 00:39:26.580
I finally get to meet you.

00:39:32.036 --> 00:39:34.421
You're here for the audio file, right?

00:39:35.998 --> 00:39:37.583
How about this?

00:39:37.583 --> 00:39:39.335
Let's make a deal.

00:39:39.335 --> 00:39:41.712
What deal?

00:39:41.712 --> 00:39:44.548
You got the old man's inheritance.

00:39:44.548 --> 00:39:47.593
Gu Hou Ze should be a burden to you.

00:39:47.593 --> 00:39:52.647
If you leave him,
I'll destroy all the recordings.

00:39:53.766 --> 00:39:56.102
You're wrong.

00:39:56.102 --> 00:39:58.062
I won't leave him.

00:39:58.062 --> 00:39:59.855
I truly love him.

00:39:59.855 --> 00:40:02.900
What right do you have to love him?

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:07.530
For Gu Hou Ze, I can kill his mother.

00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:09.407
I can also give up my life.

00:40:09.407 --> 00:40:11.374
What right do you have to love him?

00:40:13.577 --> 00:40:16.122
As a woman, I truly admire you.

00:40:16.122 --> 00:40:18.624
I may not be able to do what you can.

00:40:18.624 --> 00:40:22.177
I believe your love is just as strong as mine.

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:26.715
But I want you to spare yourself and Gu Hou Ze.

00:40:26.715 --> 00:40:27.883
What you did for him

00:40:27.883 --> 00:40:30.386
will always hold
a very important place in his heart.

00:40:30.386 --> 00:40:33.055
Stop talking nonsense.
I don't understand a word.

00:40:33.055 --> 00:40:35.641
What place are you talking about?

00:40:35.641 --> 00:40:39.903
What I want is the spot beside Gu Hou Ze.

00:40:43.315 --> 00:40:46.201
I know I can't be of much help today.

00:40:47.027 --> 00:40:51.706
But I still want you to know he's in pain.

00:40:53.617 --> 00:40:56.454
He's been suffering because of the past.

00:40:56.454 --> 00:40:58.414
I can only ease his pain in my own way.

00:40:58.414 --> 00:41:02.384
What are you capable of?
Is it beyond my abilities?

00:41:03.252 --> 00:41:05.796
I'll have this child with him.

00:41:05.796 --> 00:41:08.966
I'll give him the most ordinary, simplest life.

00:41:08.966 --> 00:41:10.468
That's what he wants.

00:41:10.468 --> 00:41:12.803
You're truly shameless.

00:41:12.803 --> 00:41:16.932
Aren't you just forcing me to release
the recording for the whole world to hear?

00:41:16.932 --> 00:41:19.560
Let's see how you're going to
live a simple life then.

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:20.811
What a joke.

00:41:20.811 --> 00:41:24.440
If that's what we have to bear, we will.

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:26.859
But I believe this will make us
love each other even more.

00:41:26.859 --> 00:41:28.694
Fine.

00:41:28.694 --> 00:41:30.745
Let's see...

00:41:31.697 --> 00:41:33.999
Let's see if you'll regret it then.

00:41:36.702 --> 00:41:41.665
If hurting him is the only way
you can love him,

00:41:41.665 --> 00:41:42.917
then I wish you all the best.

00:41:42.917 --> 00:41:44.585
I hope in the future,

00:41:44.585 --> 00:41:45.836
you can meet someone you truly love.

00:41:45.836 --> 00:41:48.339
Who are you to preach to me about love?

00:41:48.339 --> 00:41:50.174
Listen up!

00:41:50.174 --> 00:41:54.303
Gu Hou Ze will realize one day
that he is wrong.

00:41:54.303 --> 00:41:57.431
I'm the one who loves him
the most in this world,

00:41:57.431 --> 00:41:58.933
not you.

00:41:58.933 --> 00:42:01.644
He will come back to me and leave you.

00:42:01.644 --> 00:42:03.729
I wish you all the best.

00:42:03.729 --> 00:42:06.072
What are you wishing for? Be clear!

00:42:06.982 --> 00:42:09.868
Who needs your blessing?

00:42:11.654 --> 00:42:14.156
Shameless woman!

00:42:14.156 --> 00:42:17.292
Bitch, you have no right to love Gu Hou Ze!

00:42:50.526 --> 00:42:52.786
Can I talk to you?

00:42:54.029 --> 00:42:56.873
I'm sorry, I have a lot of work to do.

00:42:58.951 --> 00:43:01.920
I have the receipt for the money
Mrs. Hong transferred to you.

00:43:08.627 --> 00:43:10.254
You can take a look at the back pages.

00:43:10.254 --> 00:43:12.631
Here. There are clearer photos on the computer.

00:43:12.631 --> 00:43:15.092
I think the first design is good.

00:43:15.092 --> 00:43:18.762
Yes, I think the first one looks more youthful.

00:43:18.762 --> 00:43:20.973
It has a large area.

00:43:20.973 --> 00:43:22.474
- Yes, floor-to-ceiling windows.
- Floor-to-ceiling windows.

00:43:22.474 --> 00:43:24.018
I think it's a feature.

00:43:24.018 --> 00:43:26.770
Yes. And...

00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:28.063
- Hi.
- Mom.

00:43:28.063 --> 00:43:29.857
How's the progress?

00:43:29.857 --> 00:43:31.442
We're almost done discussing
the business model.

00:43:31.442 --> 00:43:33.319
All that's left is the main visual.

00:43:33.319 --> 00:43:35.529
We've had a few offers, but...

00:43:35.529 --> 00:43:37.531
they're not ideal.

00:43:37.531 --> 00:43:40.701
Your uncle and I are going to
Sheraton for dinner tonight.

00:43:40.701 --> 00:43:42.620
Do you want to join us?

00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:44.496
I'm fine either way.

00:43:44.496 --> 00:43:47.715
You guys go ahead. We're still discussing.

00:43:49.126 --> 00:43:52.254
I've never seen you so serious.

00:43:52.254 --> 00:43:54.305
What did you do to him?

00:43:57.426 --> 00:43:58.969
All right. Carry on with your work.

00:43:58.969 --> 00:44:00.304
I'll get going.

00:44:00.304 --> 00:44:01.896
Bye.

00:44:04.183 --> 00:44:06.018
And I think the plants...

00:44:06.018 --> 00:44:08.778
The plants in front have to be good, too.

00:44:10.397 --> 00:44:12.733
Vice President Qian took
kickbacks from the suppliers.

00:44:12.733 --> 00:44:15.243
He took money through your account, right?

00:44:24.578 --> 00:44:26.330
I took kickbacks from the suppliers.

00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:28.207
It has nothing to do with Vice President Qian.

00:44:28.207 --> 00:44:30.376
Why would the suppliers bribe a secretary?

00:44:30.376 --> 00:44:32.836
And I caught you withdrawing money
from the bank to give it to him.

00:44:32.836 --> 00:44:34.797
Why are you still lying?

00:44:34.797 --> 00:44:36.649
I owe the Vice President money.

00:44:36.649 --> 00:44:38.550
Can't I pay him back?

00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:40.344
Why do you have to take the blame?

00:44:40.344 --> 00:44:42.513
Qian Xiao An is using you.

00:44:42.513 --> 00:44:45.773
You'll not only get fired,
but you'll also end up in jail.

00:44:48.394 --> 00:44:50.396
Did he threaten you?

00:44:50.396 --> 00:44:52.314
Or does he have something on you?

00:44:52.314 --> 00:44:53.816
No.

00:44:53.816 --> 00:44:55.401
He's very good to me.

00:44:55.401 --> 00:44:57.785
Can you stop talking nonsense?

00:44:59.571 --> 00:45:01.865
Don't tell me...

00:45:01.865 --> 00:45:03.666
you're in love with him?

00:45:08.205 --> 00:45:10.040
Anyway, I'm the only one who did it.

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:11.758
Believe it or not, it's up to you.

00:45:30.352 --> 00:45:32.153
Thank you.

00:45:35.149 --> 00:45:37.784
Pan Xin Tong came to see me today.

00:45:38.861 --> 00:45:41.238
She has a copy of
Mrs. Hong's bank transfer receipt,

00:45:41.238 --> 00:45:44.116
and a video of you taking me
to the bank to withdraw money.

00:45:44.116 --> 00:45:45.659
How did she get a video of us?

00:45:45.659 --> 00:45:47.418
She followed us.

00:45:48.036 --> 00:45:49.997
Damn it.

00:45:49.997 --> 00:45:51.957
I'm afraid she'll do something else.

00:45:51.957 --> 00:45:54.334
So, I asked for a leave of absence.

00:45:54.334 --> 00:45:56.086
You did the right thing.

00:45:56.086 --> 00:45:57.671
Don't go to the office yet.

00:45:57.671 --> 00:46:00.139
I'll help you take leave
under the guise of a business trip.

00:46:03.469 --> 00:46:04.720
For the next few days,

00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:08.265
go to the bank periodically
and withdraw the money for me.

00:46:08.265 --> 00:46:11.067
Next week, you'll stay
in Singapore for a while.

00:46:12.853 --> 00:46:14.772
Singapore?

00:46:14.772 --> 00:46:16.732
Think of it as a vacation.

00:46:16.732 --> 00:46:19.325
Don't worry, I'll find someone
to meet you there.

00:46:20.569 --> 00:46:22.488
Once we take over
the management rights of Hongfa,

00:46:22.488 --> 00:46:24.872
you can come back.

00:46:26.909 --> 00:46:28.952
Okay.

00:46:28.952 --> 00:46:31.045
All right, be good.

00:46:56.355 --> 00:47:00.067
I wonder if I can schedule
a solo interview with you next time.

00:47:00.067 --> 00:47:02.945
Sure, just make an appointment
with my company's secretary.

00:47:02.945 --> 00:47:04.530
Okay, no problem. Thank you.

00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:06.122
Bye.

00:47:16.367 --> 00:47:17.262

Xiao Zheng.

00:47:46.697 --> 00:47:48.282
Can you do me a favor?

00:47:48.282 --> 00:47:52.703
Help me look into a psychiatrist
named Gu Hou Ze.

00:47:52.703 --> 00:47:54.587
He's also a writer.
