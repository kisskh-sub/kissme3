00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.820
When you realize it's love,

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.390
it's as if a tiny spotlight
above your head is lit up.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.260
Searching alone on a wooden floor
where I couldn't see anything,

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.330
I'm suddenly blinded by some bright light.
So I lower my head,

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.380
and find that my feet are

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.600
surrounded by countless shiny diamonds
reflecting light.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.530
Iljo is not a stone kicked to my feet,

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.960
but a gem that only I can understand.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.550
Jeonghan!

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:24.620
Jeonghan! Jeonghan!

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.680
Ugh, you're so noisy.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.329
Oh!

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.130
You have to be gentle and precise
with tomatoes.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.270
Their growth slows down below 13 degrees.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.930
When it's over 30 degrees,
pollination stops.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.380
And if you water them too often,

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.380
the roots will rot
and they'll get sick easily.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.720
Side shoots grow between their leaves.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.540
If you don't cut these off,

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.670
the fruit won't get ripe.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.660
Right, if they lack calcium,

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.520
there will be blossom-end rot.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.390
Isn't the name funny?

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.230
Blossom-end rot.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.920
Ugh, it's so hot.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.360
How have you been?

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.910
Took you long enough to ask.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.080
I don't know.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.400
My life sucks. Everything sucks.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.370
All that company and inheritance stuff...

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.260
I don't care about all that.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.230
They need more than six hours
of direct sunlight.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.840
They only turn red after sunbathing.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.540
So dirty.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:36.960
You have it.

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.860
Jeez, so dirty.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.070
Try it!

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.860
Jeez, so dirty.

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.090
Hey.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.530
Give me that.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.050
Hey! Wait!

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.300
What's wrong with you? Wait!

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.180
Come here! Come!

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.600
Wait.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.450
I said, wait!

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.760
Jeonghan?

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:39.750
Why did you come without telling me?

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.420
Can't I come?

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.950
What about the company?

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:48.659
I'm on leave.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.700
How did you know I was here?

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.790
Where else can you go?

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.470
Right.

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:08.710
Didn't you say you wouldn't move out?

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.020
I didn't move out.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.030
Then?

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:19.030
I just... miss my dad.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.110
I guess you managed to keep it.

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.550
This house.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:36.140
Wasn't Seo Jeongin riled up about
this being part of the inheritance?

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:38.880
Yeah.

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:42.510
This house isn't worth much anyway.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.860
When are you coming home?

00:07:49.409 --> 00:07:50.960
I don't know.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.550
Jeonghan.

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:24.990
What?

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:30.340
Why did you try to leave without saying hi
when you came all the way here?

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.330
Because you look the most at ease here.

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:41.000
You should've just lived here.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.169
Why did you come to Seoul?

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:46.880
My dad was so sick he was hospitalized.

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:53.440
I wanted to spend more time by his side.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.720
But you wasted your youth.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:01.390
He didn't even register you as his son.
Why do you love him so much?

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:03.170
I really don't understand.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.340
My dad said he wanted me to be happy.

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:14.560
That's all he wanted.

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:20.240
But I don't know if I deserve to be happy.

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:24.560
I just

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:29.440
wanted to return the love I received.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.860
Jeonghan.

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.360
There's no reason for love.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:41.160
There's no price either.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.100
At least, that's how my love is.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.290
But every time I see you, I get greedy.

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:03.070
I thought...

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:06.360
maybe I can also be happy.

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:08.640
Can't I...

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.640
be happy?

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:29.920
What's wrong?

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.330
I'm going for a walk.

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:47.290
Iljo.

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:50.970
Do you want me to move here too?

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:55.020
What about the company?

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:58.380
It's boring;

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:01.180
the company and living there.

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:04.470
Is it?

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:08.710
Since you're so rich,
you can renovate the place for me.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.480
Upgrade the entire house

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.060
and build a pool in the yard...

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:14.320
Hey!

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.550
What?

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:17.710
Aren't you rich?

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:20.210
You little brat!

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:21.440
Ouch.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.840
By the way,

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.120
why aren't you asking me to like you?

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.170
One-sided love suits me better.

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:37.720
Oh, really?

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:43.260
How many people have you had a crush on?

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.990
Give me a sec.

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:49.830
Hey!

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:54.820
What?

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:57.100
Do you want me to beg you to like me?

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:06.200
How does your mind jump around like that?

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.740
I'm quite quick-witted, you know?

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:11.620
Fine, good for you.

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:15.590
Okay.

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:19.660
I'll do it just for you.

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:20.900
Do what?

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:24.840
Jeonghan.

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:27.770
Please like me.

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.300
What are you talking about?

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.070
Please like me. Pretty please.

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:37.000
Stop it.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.770
What if I don't stop?

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:40.340
What would you do?

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:42.090
Why are you being such a pain?

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:43.940
Please like me, yeah?

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:46.540
Please, just like me, won't you?

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:48.140
Are you testing my patience?

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:49.410
Nope!

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:53.980
Jeonghan!

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:55.840
Please like me!

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:58.310
Just like me!

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:00.120
Hey, Lee Iljo, you...

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.370
Please like me!

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:14.810
Jeonghan.

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:20.650
Jeonghan!

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:23.410
Jeong...

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.280
Oh my god.

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.380
You scared me.

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:38.010
You can be greedy.

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:40.500
You deserve it.

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:42.230
You deserve happiness.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.230
Okay.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.230
You don't want to go?

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:27.930
Should I just stay?

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:30.870
No.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:32.770
You have to go.

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:34.550
You have work to do too.

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:38.790
No hesitation at all, huh, Lee Iljo?

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.320
You have to go make money.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.520
How else are you going to provide for me?

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.490
Get some rest.
Take your time and come back soon.

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:54.750
How can I both
take my time and go back soon?

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:56.460
You know what I mean.

00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:59.890
Okay.

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:05.490
First of all,
excluding public education,

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:09.080
it's rare to have a perfect match
for private education.

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.460
In comparison, competition...

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:15.180
[Lee Iljo:
I'll be back soon.]

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:18.900
[Seo Jeonghan:
Soon when?]

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:24.740
[Seo Jeonghan:
When are you coming back?]

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:40.140
[Seo Jeonghan:
I'm lonely. Come back.]

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:48.270
[Lee Iljo:
Don't you work?]

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:54.900
[Seo Jeonghan:
I'm the CEO's son.]

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:56.650
Jeonghan.

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:07.960
Lee Iljo.

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.130
So when are you coming back?

00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:12.560
Aren't you tired of asking?

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.950
Yes, I'm not tired of asking.

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:16.950
I'll keep asking until you
tell me when you'll be back.

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:18.510
I'll be back in no time.

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:20.570
Ugh!

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:22.080
I don't want to hear

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.560
"soon" and "in no time."

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.800
Don't you know words
like "now" or "right away"?

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.920
So you know how to pester others too.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.280
Hey, Lee Iljo.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:33.530
Do you think this is fun?

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:37.230
Forget it.

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:38.270
I'm hanging out.

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:40.620
Hey, fine, I'm going back.

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:44.590
When?

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:46.870
Um... Next Friday?

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:49.420
This Friday.

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:51.270
O-Okay.

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:52.770
See you at the restaurant.

00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:54.060
At 6 PM.

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:55.910
The restaurant?

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:57.800
Yeah.

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.800
The restaurant
where we had dinner together

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.030
before spending a hot night together
in the hotel.

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:05.270
G-Got it.

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:07.420
Go to sleep.

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:08.460
Okay.

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:09.819
Good night.

[Royal Cuisine
Reservation Confirmation]

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.050
I've been learning to cook
through online blogs.

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:46.630
Oh.

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:47.960
Me too.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.140
Did you learn how to cook?

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:49.380
Yes.

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.800
-Do you cook for your girlfriend?
-Yes.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:53.100
I cooked for her yesterday too.

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:55.670
Wow, she's so lucky.

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:01.450
What's wrong?

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:03.130
-N-Nothing.
-Nothing

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:14.660
[Seo Jeonghan:
6 PM tonight at Royal Cuisine.]

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:17.580
[Seo Jeonghan:
See you soon.]

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:36.920
[Call me when you see this.]
[Iljo, did something happen?]

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:37.940
[Did you forget about tonight?]

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:48.080
The phone is turned off.

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.210
Please leave a message after the tone.

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:11.330
The phone is turned off.

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:12.700
Please leave a...

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:35.980
What's going on, Lee Iljo?

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:46.960
Ta-da.

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:50.220
Damn it.

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:52.550
You must be waiting for someone.

00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:56.180
Who is it?

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.210
A friend?

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:03.720
I think this is too much.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.750
A boyfriend?

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:07.760
Shut up and get lost.

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:11.740
You are great in all aspects,

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:13.420
but just too cold to me, your cousin.

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:14.530
[Where are you?
Did something happen?]

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:17.360
Why don't you help
sell some alcohol at my store?

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:20.980
Don't waste your money
on that stupid parasite.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.030
Stupid parasite?

00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:27.980
You heard me right.

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:30.710
Lee Iljo, the one who
brought shame to our family.

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:39.030
Your problem is that
you're too compassionate.

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:41.710
You pity him, don't you?

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:47.050
Acting all pathetic in that shabby house.

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:50.640
Did you meet him?

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:52.890
Paid him a visit after a long time.

00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:58.400
Why?

00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.890
Can't we meet?

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:03.440
He's my younger brother after all.

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:06.140
Where did you meet him?

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:07.660
Where else?

00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:13.510
The place where my deceased father lived.

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:20.320
No matter what I do,
he wouldn't let go of that house.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.990
I didn't expect him to
target my dad for that house

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:26.250
while he was ill and delirious.

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:32.410
I can't do anything about it
because of the freaking will.

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:36.580
I thought he was just a loser.
Turns out he's a sly fox.

00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:44.100
I know you're doing this
because you're bored,

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:46.040
but don't be too nice to him.

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:50.460
What if he clings onto you like a leech?

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:57.560
But don't worry. I've given him a warning.

00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:59.620
He won't bother you anymore.

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:17.680
Why are you getting all riled up
over nothing?

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:21.630
Jeonghan.

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:24.090
Do you think you're any different?

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:27.280
You're just toying with him as you wish.

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.270
You're the worst.

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.340
I'm leaving.

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:41.050
Have fun.

00:22:57.490 --> 00:23:00.610
You're just toying with him as you wish.

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:06.230
Hey, it hurts.

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:10.650
Lick it.

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:26.040
How dare you get on top?

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.030
What about everything we've done so far?

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:44.990
What was I to you?

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:47.980
Whatever it was, it's meaningless.

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:50.110
Not that you ever meant anything to me.

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:09.300
Sir. Sir!

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:16.380
We're closing.

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:18.080
Oh.

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:19.280
Okay.

00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:54.740
Lee Iljo?

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:56.220
Jeonghan.

00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:08.750
Lee Iljo.

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:11.130
Lift your head up.

00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:25.300
I didn't want you...

00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:28.480
to see me like this.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.540
Are you stupid?

00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:32.960
What do you take me for?

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:35.990
I'm sorry.

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:44.530
Let me have a look.

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:53.010
Seo Jeongin, that bastard!

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:55.850
Jeonghan.

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.550
How could he do this to you?

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:16.090
I look horrible now, don't I?

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:20.460
No, you look pretty.

00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:25.760
Iljo.

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:33.770
Let's be official.

00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:34.970
What?

00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:49.140
I said, let's be official.

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:56.100
[In the next episode]

00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:58.850
Iljo.

00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:00.570
You still like me, don't you?

00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:02.020
Hey.

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:03.640
Why aren't you answering me?

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:05.670
You'll regret losing me, you know?

00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:08.730
Do you think you can find someone else
as handsome as me?

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:12.140
Looks aren't everything.

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:15.270
But I'll regret losing you.

00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:17.540
I know it's too late,

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:19.580
but can't you give me a chance?

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:22.650
I don't want to be with you
while my heart's wounded.
