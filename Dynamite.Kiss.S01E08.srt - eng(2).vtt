DYNAMITE KISS

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:53.700
Are you sure you'll be okay?

00:00:53.783 --> 00:00:55.201
You don't have to be there.

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:58.162
Don't be silly.

00:00:58.246 --> 00:01:00.206
It's a meeting
with my son's future in-laws.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.458
Of course, I should be by your side.

00:01:03.042 --> 00:01:04.377
Tell me if you ever feel uncomfortable.

00:01:04.961 --> 00:01:06.171
I'll get you out of there.

00:01:07.755 --> 00:01:09.424
I know I haven't been

00:01:10.425 --> 00:01:12.594
much of a mom to you.

00:01:13.178 --> 00:01:14.470
What's gotten into you?

00:01:15.054 --> 00:01:17.599
Now that your son's about to get married,
is it making you all sentimental?

00:01:19.475 --> 00:01:21.060
It seems I've only been

00:01:21.936 --> 00:01:23.563
thinking about myself for far too long.

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:27.609
You could've used a dependable mom.

00:01:29.736 --> 00:01:30.737
I'm sorry.

00:01:31.613 --> 00:01:33.364
Why are you suddenly saying such things?

00:01:35.283 --> 00:01:36.117
You know what?

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.912
I feel very reassured to have you join me

00:01:39.495 --> 00:01:41.789
on a day like this.

00:01:44.083 --> 00:01:47.545
By the way,
when did you start dating Ha-yeong?

00:01:48.129 --> 00:01:49.547
I never knew.

00:01:49.631 --> 00:01:50.465
What?

00:01:52.467 --> 00:01:53.885
There's no exact date.

00:01:54.761 --> 00:01:57.805
You know we've been friends
since we were kids.

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:58.973
But still,

00:01:59.557 --> 00:02:02.101
I didn't realize marriage
was on the table.

00:02:03.561 --> 00:02:04.812
We know each other well enough,

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.731
so we won't have reasons to fight.

00:02:08.024 --> 00:02:08.983
It all works out.

00:02:16.157 --> 00:02:17.075
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:21.454
I hear the campaign led by Ji-hyeok

00:02:21.537 --> 00:02:22.830
is being received well.

00:02:23.498 --> 00:02:24.332
Beyond expectations.

00:02:24.916 --> 00:02:25.875
I only carried on

00:02:27.043 --> 00:02:28.127
what my mother started.

00:02:28.211 --> 00:02:30.004
Oh, is that so?

00:02:30.088 --> 00:02:32.298
You've raised your son well.

00:02:33.633 --> 00:02:36.344
-Thank you.
-Gosh, you're too kind.

00:02:37.136 --> 00:02:40.848
I hear Tae-yeong's achieving great results
with companies all over the world.

00:02:40.932 --> 00:02:43.893
Yes, I'm doing even better now,
thanks to you.

00:02:44.644 --> 00:02:45.478
Because of me?

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:48.523
You brought Ji-hyeok into your company.

00:02:49.065 --> 00:02:52.110
With my biggest competitor gone,
work has been a breeze.

00:02:52.193 --> 00:02:53.027
Thank you, sir.

00:02:53.903 --> 00:02:55.113
Ji-hyeok.

00:02:55.738 --> 00:02:56.739
Thank you.

00:02:58.157 --> 00:03:03.413
Do you plan on keeping Ji-hyeok
on that rookie team of interns?

00:03:03.496 --> 00:03:04.789
No, of course not.

00:03:04.872 --> 00:03:08.001
It's meant to be temporary
until he gets the hang of things.

00:03:08.084 --> 00:03:09.877
He'll soon be where he belongs.

00:03:09.961 --> 00:03:13.089
I can't have my daughter-in-law lose face.

00:03:13.172 --> 00:03:14.465
Don't you agree, Ha-yeong?

00:03:15.383 --> 00:03:16.968
-Well--
-Speaking of which,

00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:18.803
since we're all gathered here today,

00:03:18.886 --> 00:03:21.055
I was hoping we could discuss
the kids' future.

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:24.142
Excuse me for interrupting,
but there's something I'd like to tell--

00:03:24.225 --> 00:03:25.435
I'll tell them.

00:03:28.187 --> 00:03:29.522
Ha-yeong and I

00:03:29.605 --> 00:03:31.441
would like to get married right away.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.027
Ji-hyeok.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.945
What are you talking about?

00:03:36.029 --> 00:03:37.447
I want to get married.

00:03:38.948 --> 00:03:40.366
We'll skip the engagement ceremony

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:42.410
and get married as soon as possible.

00:04:00.136 --> 00:04:02.013
You should still adhere
to the formalities.

00:04:02.597 --> 00:04:04.932
Rushing will only lead to baseless rumors.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.603
It seems he's head over heels
for Ha-yeong.

00:04:09.562 --> 00:04:12.774
I understand, but such a decision
isn't one for you two to make alone.

00:04:12.857 --> 00:04:14.400
We're going to get married anyway,

00:04:15.401 --> 00:04:16.778
so why delay it?

00:04:18.905 --> 00:04:25.661
In that case, how about we move up
the engagement ceremony, ma'am?

00:04:31.167 --> 00:04:33.920
-Sure.
-No, I don't want to do that.

00:04:34.003 --> 00:04:36.255
Oh my. You want to skip
the engagement ceremony too?

00:04:36.339 --> 00:04:37.965
-No, that's not what I--
-Understood.

00:04:40.093 --> 00:04:41.886
We'll proceed with the engagement ceremony
right away then.

00:04:44.097 --> 00:04:45.348
We can do it as early as next week.

00:04:50.812 --> 00:04:51.896
Are you crazy?

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:53.231
What's gotten into you?

00:04:53.314 --> 00:04:54.816
What were you building up to?

00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:56.859
Is this because of Go Da-rim?

00:04:58.361 --> 00:05:02.407
Am I wrong? It's not like you could've
suddenly fallen in love with me.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.909
You're doing this
because you don't want her to get hurt.

00:05:04.992 --> 00:05:06.411
I'd like to steer clear

00:05:07.203 --> 00:05:09.122
of unpleasant issues within my team.

00:05:09.205 --> 00:05:10.706
It could also hurt my future standing

00:05:11.332 --> 00:05:12.250
with the company.

00:05:14.961 --> 00:05:16.212
Your standing?

00:05:16.295 --> 00:05:18.464
Since when did you care so much
about the company?

00:05:18.548 --> 00:05:20.007
I made a deal with my father.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.553
If I establish myself in the company
and marry you,

00:05:23.636 --> 00:05:25.179
he'll give me what I want.

00:05:25.263 --> 00:05:28.933
After talking all that smack about him,
you're no better than your father.

00:05:29.976 --> 00:05:32.270
I'm sorry, but I won't be marrying you.

00:05:32.353 --> 00:05:33.688
I came to tell them that today.

00:05:35.064 --> 00:05:36.315
Don't try to stop me.

00:05:38.109 --> 00:05:38.985
Sure, tell them.

00:05:40.445 --> 00:05:41.737
That makes it easier for me.

00:05:42.405 --> 00:05:44.073
You'll just get locked up in your house…

00:05:46.534 --> 00:05:48.077
until the day of the engagement ceremony.

00:06:02.675 --> 00:06:05.011
Couldn't you have been more affable
in front of the in-laws?

00:06:05.595 --> 00:06:08.222
You could've been more conversational
with Chairman Yu's wife.

00:06:08.306 --> 00:06:10.766
You looked like
you were being dragged to your death.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.894
I didn't come to appease you.

00:06:13.728 --> 00:06:16.314
-I endured it for Ji-hyeok's sake.
-That's exactly my point.

00:06:16.397 --> 00:06:18.733
Your son is bending over backward for you,

00:06:18.816 --> 00:06:20.401
and you couldn't even meet him halfway?

00:06:22.278 --> 00:06:23.696
What do you mean by that?

00:06:24.697 --> 00:06:26.866
What do you mean
he's bending over backward for me?

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.455
What have you done to Ji-hyeok?

00:06:35.625 --> 00:06:37.001
It's what he wanted.

00:06:37.084 --> 00:06:40.171
In exchange for marrying
into Chairman Yu's family, I divorce you.

00:06:40.838 --> 00:06:43.966
It's not a bad deal for me, so I agreed.

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:45.218
So,

00:06:45.927 --> 00:06:47.386
behave yourself accordingly.

00:07:20.628 --> 00:07:21.462
Let's speed it up.

00:07:22.046 --> 00:07:22.880
Faster.

00:07:34.475 --> 00:07:35.393
That's good.

00:07:36.561 --> 00:07:37.395
You can go.

00:07:39.397 --> 00:07:41.315
Is it because I've already been married?

00:07:41.399 --> 00:07:43.234
Why does it have to be them?

00:07:45.736 --> 00:07:47.196
I think we'd be a better match.

00:07:48.948 --> 00:07:50.408
I'm going to leave
if you're going to talk nonsense.

00:07:50.491 --> 00:07:52.493
Relax. I'm kidding.

00:07:53.828 --> 00:07:54.829
But it didn't seem like

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:58.291
they particularly liked each other.

00:07:58.374 --> 00:08:00.209
Do they have to like each other
to get married?

00:08:00.793 --> 00:08:02.169
It's just work, after all.

00:08:02.253 --> 00:08:03.421
I'd expect no less

00:08:04.422 --> 00:08:05.840
from Natural BeBe's chairman's
eldest daughter.

00:08:08.593 --> 00:08:10.595
I can't forget you for good reason.

00:08:10.678 --> 00:08:12.054
Take that hand off me.

00:08:17.018 --> 00:08:17.977
Stop glaring at me.

00:08:18.561 --> 00:08:20.479
I called you out here to help you.

00:08:24.025 --> 00:08:25.818
I wonder how you could possibly help me.

00:08:25.901 --> 00:08:26.986
You want to split them up,

00:08:28.112 --> 00:08:28.946
don't you?

00:08:31.616 --> 00:08:33.034
Fine, I'll help you.

00:08:34.035 --> 00:08:36.495
Do you want to die
as Chairman Gong's handmaid?

00:08:36.579 --> 00:08:39.707
Are you just going to sit back and watch
Ji-hyeok take over Natural BeBe?

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:42.418
Do your charity work at that dog shelter.

00:08:42.501 --> 00:08:44.629
Don't serve the company to him
on a silver platter.

00:08:45.463 --> 00:08:46.922
You're way off.

00:08:47.006 --> 00:08:48.841
Ji-hyeok has no interest in the company.

00:08:53.095 --> 00:08:55.139
If you want to judge
someone's true character,

00:08:55.806 --> 00:08:57.350
you can't trust what they say.

00:08:57.433 --> 00:08:58.517
You need to see how they act.

00:09:00.144 --> 00:09:01.854
Do you think

00:09:02.688 --> 00:09:05.024
he would've led and pushed this campaign
so aggressively

00:09:05.107 --> 00:09:06.651
if he had no interest
in the company at all?

00:09:08.861 --> 00:09:10.613
Not to mention,
it's unlikely Chairman Gong

00:09:11.155 --> 00:09:12.281
will pass on the company

00:09:13.157 --> 00:09:16.452
to his mistress's daughter
when he has a legitimate son.

00:09:16.535 --> 00:09:17.620
He's old-fashioned like that.

00:09:25.753 --> 00:09:27.380
That damn mouth of yours.

00:09:27.463 --> 00:09:28.589
Watch what comes out of it.

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:31.175
I'll let it slide this once
for old times' sake.

00:09:32.927 --> 00:09:33.844
Move.

00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:58.452
Does your husband

00:09:59.245 --> 00:10:00.705
know you're here?

00:10:13.509 --> 00:10:15.678
A man lives here alone.

00:10:17.221 --> 00:10:19.056
What would people say
if they saw you here?

00:10:29.024 --> 00:10:30.526
Don't cross the line.

00:10:37.324 --> 00:10:39.076
GONG JI-HYEOK AND YU HA-YEONG
ANNOUNCE THEIR ENGAGEMENT

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.538
Mr. Gong and Ms. Yu are getting engaged?

00:10:42.621 --> 00:10:43.622
-My goodness.
-Unbelievable.

00:10:43.706 --> 00:10:45.750
It's a bit sad to find out about it
through the press.

00:10:45.833 --> 00:10:47.877
-You knew, Mr. Kang, didn't you?
-I'm sorry.

00:10:48.502 --> 00:10:49.587
It was top secret.

00:10:51.046 --> 00:10:52.131
Good morning.

00:10:52.631 --> 00:10:54.675
-What was top secret?
-Da-rim, look at this.

00:11:00.222 --> 00:11:01.599
CONGLOMERATE MARRIAGE BUSINESS?

00:11:01.682 --> 00:11:03.350
GONG JI-HYEOK AND YU HA-YEONG
ANNOUNCE THEIR ENGAGEMENT

00:11:09.315 --> 00:11:11.150
Where's Mr. Gong Ji-hyeok's office?

00:11:12.485 --> 00:11:14.570
He's in the middle of a meeting right now.

00:11:15.279 --> 00:11:17.072
Do you have an appointment?

00:11:17.156 --> 00:11:18.407
It's fine.

00:11:18.491 --> 00:11:20.701
I don't need to make one to see him.

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:23.704
-I still can't believe it.
-You didn't know either, right?

00:11:23.787 --> 00:11:25.206
Shocking, right? We're shocked too.

00:11:25.289 --> 00:11:26.874
-There he is.
-Good morning.

00:11:38.594 --> 00:11:39.470
TEAM LEADER GONG JI-HYEOK

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:08.541
So they were engaged.

00:12:10.209 --> 00:12:12.127
That's why he got so upset

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:14.505
when I showed up at his place.

00:12:20.719 --> 00:12:22.054
What am I going to do?

00:12:27.476 --> 00:12:29.270
What a wasted opportunity.

00:12:29.895 --> 00:12:32.439
If Mr. Gong Ji-hyeok had come to our team,

00:12:32.523 --> 00:12:34.108
I would've made a move on him.

00:12:35.276 --> 00:12:37.319
That wouldn't have made a difference.

00:12:37.403 --> 00:12:40.197
It's obvious. It's a marriage agreement
with Taeyu C&T.

00:12:41.615 --> 00:12:45.286
Wait, then is he guaranteed
to become the successor to Natural BeBe?

00:12:46.453 --> 00:12:47.454
Probably.

00:12:48.289 --> 00:12:51.041
Director Gong Ji-hye will just become
the dog that chased her own tail.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.132
These people…

00:13:07.099 --> 00:13:09.059
My apologies.
I'll find which team they're in

00:13:09.143 --> 00:13:11.645
-and teach them a lesson.
-Forget it.

00:13:12.146 --> 00:13:14.064
-Did you bring it?
-Yes, ma'am.

00:13:25.868 --> 00:13:26.910
What the heck?

00:13:26.994 --> 00:13:29.079
This is it? This is nothing.

00:13:29.163 --> 00:13:31.415
With so many people around,

00:13:31.498 --> 00:13:33.751
I just couldn't get the shot.

00:13:33.834 --> 00:13:35.377
If that was the case,

00:13:36.086 --> 00:13:37.838
you should've made it happen.

00:13:38.505 --> 00:13:40.466
How am I supposed to do that?

00:13:40.549 --> 00:13:41.717
Do whatever it takes!

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.969
Make it happen and bring me evidence!

00:13:45.512 --> 00:13:46.847
Yes, ma'am.

00:13:50.184 --> 00:13:51.852
What's there to even think about?

00:13:51.935 --> 00:13:53.604
You're here to make money,
not play around.

00:13:53.687 --> 00:13:57.274
I just need to work as a team member
with him as the team leader. That's it.

00:13:57.358 --> 00:13:59.610
Why? Because I'm a pro!

00:13:59.693 --> 00:14:02.196
I'm a pro, so I'll act like one.

00:14:02.279 --> 00:14:03.781
Yeah, a pro!

00:14:19.213 --> 00:14:20.381
Mr. Gong.

00:14:21.215 --> 00:14:23.926
First, I sincerely congratulate you
on your engagement.

00:14:24.009 --> 00:14:26.929
I once again sincerely apologize
for showing up at your place.

00:14:27.012 --> 00:14:29.139
I swear that I had no other intentions.

00:14:29.223 --> 00:14:31.850
However, I can see how Ms. Yu
could've misunderstood,

00:14:31.934 --> 00:14:34.019
so I'm indeed at fault.

00:14:34.603 --> 00:14:35.646
As long as you're aware.

00:14:37.147 --> 00:14:38.148
Is that why you're here?

00:14:40.901 --> 00:14:42.778
These are the reviews
from the participants

00:14:42.861 --> 00:14:44.238
of the tree-planting event.

00:14:44.321 --> 00:14:46.907
The communications team
wanted three of them for a feature,

00:14:46.991 --> 00:14:49.076
so I've compiled a shortlist.

00:14:55.833 --> 00:14:57.042
I don't see any photos.

00:14:57.126 --> 00:14:58.502
I've included photos

00:14:58.585 --> 00:15:01.130
on the very last page.

00:15:09.805 --> 00:15:10.639
I see.

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:12.474
Good work.

00:15:12.558 --> 00:15:13.559
Not at all.

00:15:13.642 --> 00:15:15.686
I simply fulfilled my duties

00:15:15.769 --> 00:15:17.521
because I'm a pro.

00:15:18.105 --> 00:15:20.733
Do you have any other questions
or assignments for me?

00:15:20.816 --> 00:15:21.734
I don't.

00:15:22.609 --> 00:15:23.569
You may leave.

00:15:23.652 --> 00:15:25.487
Okay, then I'll get going.

00:15:45.841 --> 00:15:47.009
Mr. Gong.

00:15:47.092 --> 00:15:49.136
Are you here to make a copy?

00:15:49.219 --> 00:15:51.013
Allow me to help you.

00:15:56.143 --> 00:15:58.353
How many copies would you like?

00:15:59.688 --> 00:16:02.483
Thank you, but I can manage.

00:16:03.067 --> 00:16:04.485
Yes, sir. I understand.

00:16:04.568 --> 00:16:07.446
Then I shall get out of your way.

00:16:36.433 --> 00:16:37.601
I…

00:16:38.894 --> 00:16:40.729
I hope there are no misunderstandings.

00:16:40.813 --> 00:16:43.065
The only reason I did this for you

00:16:43.148 --> 00:16:45.734
is because
I'm on break room duty this week.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.449
All right then.

00:16:55.536 --> 00:16:57.371
Oh, that's hot!

00:17:20.227 --> 00:17:21.770
Thank you.

00:17:21.854 --> 00:17:23.564
Why do you make me worry?

00:17:24.898 --> 00:17:25.732
Sorry?

00:17:26.358 --> 00:17:28.360
You always mess up,
get hurt, and fall ill.

00:17:30.404 --> 00:17:31.822
Can't you get your act together?

00:17:34.283 --> 00:17:35.909
You're such a handful.

00:17:42.249 --> 00:17:43.292
I'm sorry.

00:17:50.215 --> 00:17:53.218
I don't need a treatment.
I don't want one.

00:17:53.302 --> 00:17:55.304
Your engagement ceremony
is right around the corner.

00:17:55.387 --> 00:17:57.472
You need proper care
for your makeup to look good.

00:17:57.556 --> 00:17:58.640
I said I don't need it.

00:17:58.724 --> 00:17:59.683
I'm…

00:18:00.434 --> 00:18:01.393
not getting engaged.

00:18:02.686 --> 00:18:03.729
What's wrong with you?

00:18:03.812 --> 00:18:06.190
You were crazy about Ji-hyeok
and even packed his lunch the other day.

00:18:06.273 --> 00:18:08.317
It wasn't for him.

00:18:09.568 --> 00:18:10.444
The truth is…

00:18:12.946 --> 00:18:14.656
I like someone else.

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:15.657
What?

00:18:15.741 --> 00:18:16.575
Sorry, Mom.

00:18:16.658 --> 00:18:18.869
I should've told you sooner,

00:18:19.536 --> 00:18:20.954
but I had my reasons.

00:18:21.038 --> 00:18:21.955
What reasons?

00:18:22.497 --> 00:18:23.332
Who is it?

00:18:23.999 --> 00:18:25.292
I can't tell you just yet.

00:18:28.253 --> 00:18:30.881
If you can't tell me now,
just keep it to yourself forever.

00:18:32.341 --> 00:18:34.218
I'll pretend
we never had this conversation.

00:18:37.721 --> 00:18:40.849
-Ma'am, may we get started?
-Go ahead.

00:18:40.933 --> 00:18:44.061
Give her the bridal special,
and I'll get my usual treatment.

00:18:47.814 --> 00:18:49.066
CONGLOMERATE MARRIAGE BUSINESS?

00:18:49.149 --> 00:18:51.068
GONG JI-HYEOK AND YU HA-YEONG
ANNOUNCE THEIR ENGAGEMENT

00:19:00.827 --> 00:19:01.828
Engagement?

00:19:15.509 --> 00:19:17.803
Excuse me, Mr. Gong. Do you have a moment?

00:19:18.553 --> 00:19:20.889
This is the article about the quadruplets
who were born on Geobuk Island,

00:19:20.973 --> 00:19:22.724
published today.

00:19:22.808 --> 00:19:25.852
We've long been gifting
baby products to parents

00:19:25.936 --> 00:19:28.021
who give birth
to triplets and quadruplets.

00:19:28.105 --> 00:19:29.898
But this time,

00:19:29.982 --> 00:19:32.776
we're looking to write an article
about visiting them in person

00:19:32.859 --> 00:19:36.863
and helping out with childcare
so the parents can have a day off.

00:19:36.947 --> 00:19:39.074
How many do you need from my team?

00:19:39.157 --> 00:19:41.535
Two people from the marketing team
will be going,

00:19:41.618 --> 00:19:44.037
so we just need one from your team.

00:19:44.621 --> 00:19:45.956
I'll discuss with the team
and let you know.

00:19:47.207 --> 00:19:48.333
Well, you see,

00:19:48.417 --> 00:19:50.210
the higher-ups were going on about

00:19:50.294 --> 00:19:54.756
how the team leaders
should lead by example.

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:58.552
It looks like you'll need to
be there this time, Mr. Gong.

00:19:59.136 --> 00:20:00.220
And of course, I'll be there too.

00:20:01.805 --> 00:20:03.348
All right then.

00:20:06.268 --> 00:20:07.811
Okay.

00:20:22.993 --> 00:20:25.329
Oh, that's our ad.

00:20:25.412 --> 00:20:27.331
WATCHING YOU SEARCH
FOR A FOUR-LEAF CLOVER

00:20:27.414 --> 00:20:28.790
IS ALREADY MY GREATEST FORTUNE

00:20:59.154 --> 00:21:00.072
Wait, the bus…

00:21:12.626 --> 00:21:14.920
You always mess up,
get hurt, and fall ill.

00:21:16.671 --> 00:21:18.048
Can't you get your act together?

00:21:20.675 --> 00:21:22.135
You're such a handful.

00:22:12.686 --> 00:22:13.854
Wow, look at the sea!

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:43.466
Mr. Gong!

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:51.766
Hello, Mr. Gong.

00:23:02.319 --> 00:23:03.945
What are you doing here, Ms. Go?

00:23:05.822 --> 00:23:07.407
Well, you see,

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:10.243
my team member who was supposed to come

00:23:10.327 --> 00:23:11.828
got sick all of a sudden.

00:23:12.454 --> 00:23:14.289
She was a last-minute replacement.

00:23:14.372 --> 00:23:15.749
Why didn't you tell me that sooner?

00:23:17.334 --> 00:23:18.585
Don't worry.

00:23:18.668 --> 00:23:20.545
I'll work hard to make sure I don't mess…

00:23:22.923 --> 00:23:24.841
Wow, just look at the sea.

00:23:24.925 --> 00:23:26.468
Just look at it.

00:23:26.551 --> 00:23:29.512
Man, that's nice.

00:23:38.605 --> 00:23:39.856
What a great view.

00:24:07.717 --> 00:24:08.843
ANGEL HUG BOX

00:24:09.427 --> 00:24:10.428
It's okay.

00:24:10.512 --> 00:24:11.596
It's my job.

00:24:12.347 --> 00:24:13.473
You can go first.

00:24:39.291 --> 00:24:41.876
That's nice. Here we go.

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:43.712
That's great.

00:24:43.795 --> 00:24:44.713
Let's take one more.

00:24:44.796 --> 00:24:46.798
One, two, three!

00:24:49.843 --> 00:24:51.136
That came out nice.

00:24:51.219 --> 00:24:53.054
One, two, three.

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:55.015
That's great.

00:25:04.441 --> 00:25:07.235
Just leave the babies to us,

00:25:07.319 --> 00:25:11.281
and you two can enjoy a relaxing date.

00:25:11.364 --> 00:25:13.158
Are you sure?

00:25:13.241 --> 00:25:15.410
Looking after four babies won't be easy.

00:25:15.493 --> 00:25:17.037
Don't worry about a thing.

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:20.957
That woman over there from our company
is a childcare veteran.

00:25:22.542 --> 00:25:24.502
Yes, just leave it to me.

00:25:24.586 --> 00:25:26.254
Please take good care of them.

00:25:26.338 --> 00:25:27.505
Don't worry.

00:25:27.589 --> 00:25:28.840
Good luck.

00:25:28.923 --> 00:25:30.300
Let's go.

00:25:30.884 --> 00:25:32.093
-Mr. Ma.
-Yes?

00:25:32.177 --> 00:25:33.470
Where are you going?

00:25:33.553 --> 00:25:35.847
Well, I need to go with them
and take pictures.

00:25:36.848 --> 00:25:38.099
Come on now.

00:25:38.183 --> 00:25:39.851
I can take those pictures.

00:25:39.934 --> 00:25:42.062
Wait. What's wrong, Mr. Gong?

00:25:42.771 --> 00:25:44.981
I need to take some pictures
and interview them.

00:25:45.065 --> 00:25:48.151
I have a lot to do
as the marketing team leader.

00:25:48.234 --> 00:25:49.110
So…

00:25:50.528 --> 00:25:51.613
Good luck.

00:25:52.739 --> 00:25:55.200
-Wait, I--
-No, I'll do it.

00:25:55.283 --> 00:25:56.451
-Wait--
-Go, run.

00:26:02.123 --> 00:26:05.001
Oh no. What's the matter? It's okay.

00:26:06.669 --> 00:26:07.670
You're okay.

00:26:08.254 --> 00:26:10.006
-It's all right.
-So what should I do first?

00:26:15.553 --> 00:26:16.513
It's good, isn't it?

00:26:19.349 --> 00:26:20.266
Look at you eat.

00:26:30.235 --> 00:26:31.069
Thank you.

00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:38.701
One second, Mr. Gong.

00:26:40.745 --> 00:26:42.080
There we go.

00:26:42.163 --> 00:26:43.456
Let's burp now.

00:26:46.876 --> 00:26:48.753
-Oh, there's the burp.
-I heard it too.

00:26:48.837 --> 00:26:50.046
Look at you.

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:51.798
-Good job.
-Well done.

00:27:00.348 --> 00:27:01.182
You're so cute.

00:27:22.162 --> 00:27:24.038
NATURAL BEBE SENDS THE WARMEST WISHES
TO YOUR QUADRUPLET FAMILY

00:27:26.249 --> 00:27:28.168
Thank you, Natural BeBe.

00:27:29.043 --> 00:27:31.254
Today was like a dream.

00:27:31.337 --> 00:27:33.214
Thank you, Natural BeBe.

00:27:35.258 --> 00:27:36.551
Okay!

00:27:36.634 --> 00:27:38.970
That was great.

00:27:39.053 --> 00:27:39.929
Well done.

00:27:40.013 --> 00:27:40.972
-Thank you.
-You too.

00:27:42.056 --> 00:27:43.099
Goodness.

00:27:43.183 --> 00:27:45.602
Thank you so much.
We had a really great day thanks to you.

00:27:45.685 --> 00:27:48.897
How about we go to the cafe out front

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:52.525
and leisurely enjoy a cup of coffee?

00:27:52.609 --> 00:27:54.027
No, that's all right.

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:56.488
Your colleagues must be exhausted
looking after our kids.

00:27:56.571 --> 00:27:57.655
We should get back now.

00:27:57.739 --> 00:27:59.949
You don't need to worry about them at all.

00:28:00.033 --> 00:28:02.076
One of them is a childcare expert.

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.912
But still, the last boat will depart soon.

00:28:03.995 --> 00:28:05.830
If they miss that,
they'll be stuck here all night.

00:28:06.498 --> 00:28:07.499
Exactly.

00:28:10.543 --> 00:28:12.295
The boat is leaving.

00:28:18.384 --> 00:28:19.469
Hello?

00:28:19.552 --> 00:28:21.471
Mr. Ma, where are you right now?

00:28:21.971 --> 00:28:23.806
Oh, I'm on the boat right now.

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:25.433
Did you not get on?

00:28:25.517 --> 00:28:27.727
This is the last boat.

00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:30.897
You shouldn't have
sent the parents back so late.

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:32.357
You should've watched the time!

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:33.858
I apologize.

00:28:33.942 --> 00:28:35.693
I was so focused on making it myself.

00:28:35.777 --> 00:28:38.363
I didn't realize how late they'd return.

00:28:38.446 --> 00:28:39.405
Turn the boat around.

00:28:39.989 --> 00:28:41.699
I'll pay the captain
however much they want,

00:28:41.783 --> 00:28:43.117
so just tell them to turn the boat around!

00:28:43.201 --> 00:28:44.744
Hello? Mr. Gong?

00:28:44.828 --> 00:28:48.039
Oh, is it because I'm out at sea?
I can barely hear you.

00:28:48.122 --> 00:28:49.249
Anyway, see you tomorrow.

00:29:22.907 --> 00:29:24.576
Nice shot.

00:29:32.417 --> 00:29:33.418
It's me.

00:29:34.002 --> 00:29:36.129
They should be arriving soon.

00:29:36.629 --> 00:29:40.049
Please do as I asked earlier.

00:29:40.884 --> 00:29:41.885
Oh no.

00:29:41.968 --> 00:29:44.095
We only have one room left.

00:29:44.971 --> 00:29:47.390
One? You only have one left?

00:29:47.473 --> 00:29:52.437
Yeah. We have two rooms,
but we already have a guest in that one.

00:29:53.313 --> 00:29:56.149
Then, where else
might we find lodging on the island?

00:29:56.232 --> 00:29:59.319
Nowhere.
This is the only one on the island.

00:29:59.402 --> 00:30:00.486
Oh, is that so?

00:30:01.362 --> 00:30:04.032
But the thing is,
we can't really share a room.

00:30:06.534 --> 00:30:07.994
I'm sorry,

00:30:08.077 --> 00:30:11.289
but could I possibly
sleep with you, ma'am?

00:30:11.372 --> 00:30:12.665
Then what about my husband?

00:30:12.749 --> 00:30:15.209
Goodness, that won't do.

00:30:15.293 --> 00:30:18.087
Then, could you lend us a tent
or a sleeping bag?

00:30:18.171 --> 00:30:22.634
Goodness, just drop the act
and go inside already.

00:30:22.717 --> 00:30:26.054
I've been doing this for a long time.

00:30:26.137 --> 00:30:26.971
Did you eat?

00:30:28.806 --> 00:30:30.600
Food is not the issue right now.

00:30:36.314 --> 00:30:38.650
Just give me a minute.
I'll prepare some food for you.

00:30:38.733 --> 00:30:40.276
Go inside.

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:41.694
I'll make you something tasty.

00:31:29.867 --> 00:31:30.910
What should we do

00:31:31.869 --> 00:31:32.870
about this situation?

00:31:35.039 --> 00:31:36.958
Well, we have no other choice.

00:31:39.085 --> 00:31:40.294
You should tell your husband--

00:31:40.378 --> 00:31:42.547
Don't worry,
I'll make sure he understands.

00:31:45.258 --> 00:31:47.552
But what about Ms. Yu?

00:31:48.261 --> 00:31:50.888
I'd rather not bring up anything
that might cause a misunderstanding.

00:31:52.306 --> 00:31:54.058
Right, of course.

00:31:55.226 --> 00:31:56.060
Yeah.

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:04.277
Dinner's here.

00:32:05.153 --> 00:32:05.987
-Yes.
-Coming.

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:07.864
It's not much,

00:32:08.656 --> 00:32:09.949
but eat up.

00:32:11.117 --> 00:32:13.453
There's more rice in the kitchen,

00:32:13.536 --> 00:32:16.080
so help yourself if you need more, okay?

00:32:16.164 --> 00:32:18.041
-Don't leave any leftovers.
-Okay.

00:32:18.124 --> 00:32:18.958
There'll be a fine.

00:32:19.042 --> 00:32:21.085
-Thank you, ma'am.
-Thank you.

00:32:24.088 --> 00:32:26.841
Oh my, I've never seen
anything like this before.

00:32:27.425 --> 00:32:28.342
I must try this.

00:32:28.426 --> 00:32:29.761
It looks so good.

00:32:29.844 --> 00:32:31.721
I heard this area
is known for its seafood.

00:32:31.804 --> 00:32:33.097
It's so plump.

00:32:50.698 --> 00:32:52.116
Slow down.

00:33:59.809 --> 00:34:00.643
You can use this.

00:34:01.936 --> 00:34:02.770
Thank you.

00:34:07.775 --> 00:34:09.735
What? What's wrong?

00:34:11.612 --> 00:34:12.947
-Over there.
-What is it?

00:34:14.448 --> 00:34:15.950
-A spider.
-What?

00:34:16.033 --> 00:34:16.868
A spider.

00:34:16.951 --> 00:34:19.203
-What? A spider? Where?
-A spider.

00:34:22.206 --> 00:34:23.207
Over there.

00:34:24.375 --> 00:34:25.334
Can't you see it? Over there.

00:34:26.794 --> 00:34:27.670
Just stay here.

00:34:28.254 --> 00:34:29.088
Hold on.

00:34:30.923 --> 00:34:32.300
A bit lower.

00:34:32.383 --> 00:34:33.968
-Lower?
-Just a bit lower.

00:34:34.051 --> 00:34:36.012
-Here?
-Yeah, that's it.

00:34:36.095 --> 00:34:38.264
-All right. Hold on.
-Hurry. Do it.

00:34:38.806 --> 00:34:39.640
Okay.

00:34:41.184 --> 00:34:43.394
-I can't stay still!
-Just hold on!

00:34:43.477 --> 00:34:45.354
I can't do it if you rush me!

00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:47.023
Seriously.

00:34:48.232 --> 00:34:50.776
Could they be more indecent?

00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:51.903
-Just give it to me.
-Hold on.

00:34:51.986 --> 00:34:53.362
-Hold on. That's it!
-Hold on.

00:34:53.446 --> 00:34:54.530
Oh no!

00:35:05.333 --> 00:35:06.250
It's under there.

00:35:06.334 --> 00:35:07.210
Hurry.

00:35:08.377 --> 00:35:09.337
Mr. Gong?

00:35:27.104 --> 00:35:28.856
I wasn't afraid or anything,

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:30.983
but spiders can be venomous.

00:35:31.067 --> 00:35:32.944
Spiders that size can't be venomous.

00:35:33.444 --> 00:35:34.612
You never know.

00:35:36.822 --> 00:35:37.949
You're not going to kill it?

00:35:38.032 --> 00:35:39.533
You should never kill spiders.

00:35:39.617 --> 00:35:40.952
Or they'll appear in your dreams.

00:35:43.955 --> 00:35:46.457
I sent it off on its way,
so let's close the window now.

00:36:08.437 --> 00:36:10.439
Today was tough,

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:14.610
but the babies were really cute,
weren't they?

00:36:16.862 --> 00:36:17.697
Yes.

00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:22.535
You were better at taking care of babies
than I thought.

00:36:25.538 --> 00:36:27.039
It's all thanks to you.

00:36:28.833 --> 00:36:29.959
You should sleep now.

00:36:31.043 --> 00:36:32.795
We'll take the first boat out.

00:36:33.379 --> 00:36:34.297
Right, okay.

00:36:35.214 --> 00:36:36.882
Good night.

00:36:58.571 --> 00:37:02.450
GEOBUK INN

00:39:20.754 --> 00:39:24.300
KANGKUK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

00:39:28.429 --> 00:39:29.513
How'd you find out?

00:39:29.597 --> 00:39:30.681
That's not important.

00:39:32.641 --> 00:39:33.642
Call off

00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:35.644
the engagement.

00:39:37.438 --> 00:39:40.483
-Mom.
-Why would you go to hell on my behalf?

00:39:40.566 --> 00:39:43.861
I'll take care of my own life.

00:39:45.112 --> 00:39:45.988
So you just

00:39:46.489 --> 00:39:47.615
live your life.

00:39:48.824 --> 00:39:49.992
It won't be hell.

00:39:51.035 --> 00:39:52.203
I'm fine with it.

00:39:52.912 --> 00:39:53.996
Don't worry too much.

00:39:54.079 --> 00:39:55.664
Do you love Ha-yeong?

00:39:58.459 --> 00:39:59.668
Do you love her?

00:40:03.047 --> 00:40:04.215
I need to get my suit fitted.

00:40:05.132 --> 00:40:06.175
I should get going.

00:40:10.095 --> 00:40:11.639
Reconsider it.

00:40:14.099 --> 00:40:15.017
I want you

00:40:16.101 --> 00:40:20.105
to get married to someone you truly love.

00:40:26.654 --> 00:40:30.157
That dress is from
Hera Wang's new collection, right?

00:40:30.658 --> 00:40:31.992
Of course, ma'am.

00:40:32.076 --> 00:40:35.579
We prepared the shoes and accessories
from the same collection as well.

00:40:35.663 --> 00:40:36.497
Great.

00:40:44.296 --> 00:40:46.298
I heard Ha-yeong
spouted some nonsense to you.

00:40:46.966 --> 00:40:49.760
She only said what she did
because she's getting cold feet.

00:40:49.843 --> 00:40:52.012
Women are like that, you know.

00:40:52.096 --> 00:40:54.223
I even asked my assistant
to run away with me

00:40:54.306 --> 00:40:55.933
when my date was set.

00:40:57.768 --> 00:40:59.395
I was so dramatic.

00:41:01.397 --> 00:41:03.107
I don't think you need to worry.

00:41:03.691 --> 00:41:06.068
All right. I'm glad to hear that.

00:41:06.151 --> 00:41:08.529
Help her get on the right path.

00:41:09.154 --> 00:41:12.658
She might be a little immature,
but she's still the complete package.

00:41:12.741 --> 00:41:14.994
She's pretty, has a nice body,
and a good personality.

00:41:15.077 --> 00:41:16.078
I guess

00:41:16.579 --> 00:41:18.747
she really does take a lot after me.

00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:21.458
Here comes the bride.

00:42:12.259 --> 00:42:13.093
Ji-hyeok.

00:42:14.178 --> 00:42:15.179
Ji-hyeok!

00:42:19.725 --> 00:42:21.727
My goodness, look at you.
You're completely swept away.

00:42:22.561 --> 00:42:24.772
Go and stand next to her.
Let's see the complete picture.

00:42:25.356 --> 00:42:27.483
Don't bother. I'll just go with this one.

00:42:27.566 --> 00:42:28.484
Why you…

00:42:30.611 --> 00:42:31.570
Give me a second.

00:42:38.327 --> 00:42:41.372
You were pouting and sulking
the whole fitting.

00:42:42.331 --> 00:42:45.209
I was so embarrassed
I couldn't look Ji-hyeok in the eyes.

00:42:45.292 --> 00:42:47.586
I told you I really don't want to do this.

00:42:49.296 --> 00:42:50.673
Don't you dare say that again.

00:42:56.887 --> 00:42:58.555
We can deliver the dress you saw today

00:42:58.639 --> 00:43:01.100
on the day of the engagement ceremony.

00:43:01.183 --> 00:43:02.434
Would you like that?

00:43:02.976 --> 00:43:03.936
Hey, Ji-hyeok.

00:43:04.561 --> 00:43:05.938
All right.

00:43:06.563 --> 00:43:08.857
Mom, Ji-hyeok wants to have dinner
with me.

00:43:11.443 --> 00:43:13.278
Look at him making such an effort.

00:43:14.279 --> 00:43:15.614
-Go on.
-Okay.

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:17.574
Wait, stop right there.

00:43:17.658 --> 00:43:20.536
Make sure that mouth of yours
doesn't run wild.

00:43:21.370 --> 00:43:22.329
Goodness.

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:36.135
Hello?

00:43:36.635 --> 00:43:37.970
Hey, Ji-hyeok.

00:43:38.053 --> 00:43:40.097
You're with Ha-yeong, right?

00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:41.223
Can I speak to her?

00:43:41.974 --> 00:43:44.518
Oh, she went to the bathroom.

00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:46.186
Did she?

00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:47.229
All right.

00:43:47.312 --> 00:43:49.189
Enjoy your date

00:43:49.273 --> 00:43:51.275
and have a nice dinner.

00:43:52.025 --> 00:43:52.943
Thank you.

00:44:10.669 --> 00:44:12.421
JUN BABY STUDIO

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:19.136
Ms. Yu?

00:44:20.053 --> 00:44:22.306
Take responsibility for what you did!

00:44:22.389 --> 00:44:24.600
Take responsibility for kissing me!

00:44:25.559 --> 00:44:28.020
-But you kissed me.
-Whatever.

00:44:28.103 --> 00:44:31.690
Who cares who initiated?
That's not the problem right now.

00:44:33.066 --> 00:44:34.276
Ji-hyeok saw it.

00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:37.863
-What?
-He saw us kissing.

00:44:38.447 --> 00:44:41.325
He called me a mistress
and a home-wrecker.

00:44:41.408 --> 00:44:43.118
He doesn't want Ms. Go to get hurt,

00:44:43.202 --> 00:44:46.955
so he's rushing the engagement ceremony
and the wedding.

00:45:01.178 --> 00:45:03.889
I kept my promise.

00:45:04.473 --> 00:45:05.307
But look at me now.

00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:06.892
All because of that stupid promise,

00:45:06.975 --> 00:45:08.977
I'm being called a mistress when I'm not.

00:45:09.061 --> 00:45:12.231
I couldn't even tell him
that Ms. Go is the liar!

00:45:12.314 --> 00:45:14.566
Seriously!
What are you going to do about this?

00:45:14.650 --> 00:45:16.318
Take responsibility!

00:45:16.401 --> 00:45:18.487
You take responsibility for everything!

00:45:30.332 --> 00:45:32.417
Console me. Pat-pat.

00:45:46.223 --> 00:45:48.225
Do you really not want to marry Mr. Gong

00:45:49.393 --> 00:45:50.269
that badly?

00:45:52.854 --> 00:45:56.233
I mean, he's good at his job,
and he seems like a decent guy.

00:45:57.150 --> 00:45:58.527
And you two are close friends.

00:45:58.610 --> 00:46:00.529
You don't marry someone
just because you're close to them.

00:46:00.612 --> 00:46:02.114
You marry the person you love.

00:46:03.490 --> 00:46:06.368
I like you.
How many times do I have to tell you?

00:46:08.579 --> 00:46:10.455
What I meant was

00:46:10.539 --> 00:46:13.542
you should take your time
and think about it.

00:46:16.044 --> 00:46:17.337
I did.

00:46:17.421 --> 00:46:19.464
I thought about what I really wanted

00:46:19.548 --> 00:46:21.550
and how I could find happiness.

00:46:23.176 --> 00:46:24.970
That's why I'm here right now.

00:46:30.475 --> 00:46:32.436
Can't you consider me?

00:46:38.525 --> 00:46:39.359
Hey, Yu Ha-yeong.

00:46:40.485 --> 00:46:41.445
Ji-hyeok.

00:46:43.947 --> 00:46:45.282
What are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?

00:46:45.866 --> 00:46:47.993
You're the one who's lost your mind.

00:46:48.076 --> 00:46:48.910
Leave.

00:46:52.205 --> 00:46:54.750
You don't know anything.
This is just a big misunderstanding.

00:46:54.833 --> 00:46:55.834
A misunderstanding?

00:46:55.917 --> 00:46:58.128
Then tell me. What do I not know?

00:46:58.837 --> 00:47:01.131
The truth is, Mr. Kim and Go Da-rim--

00:47:01.214 --> 00:47:02.424
Ms. Yu!

00:47:17.522 --> 00:47:19.441
I'd like to talk to Mr. Gong alone.

00:47:21.943 --> 00:47:22.944
Can you please leave us?

00:47:35.457 --> 00:47:36.416
I'm sorry.

00:47:38.126 --> 00:47:39.670
It's all my fault.

00:47:39.753 --> 00:47:42.130
I got drunk that day and made a mistake.

00:47:42.214 --> 00:47:43.382
If that day was a mistake,

00:47:43.465 --> 00:47:44.800
what was today?

00:47:46.093 --> 00:47:47.094
What did I just see?

00:47:47.177 --> 00:47:49.262
I was trying to persuade Ms. Yu.

00:47:51.473 --> 00:47:52.933
You're a coward until the end.

00:47:54.267 --> 00:47:55.185
You have no feelings,

00:47:55.894 --> 00:47:57.396
but Ha-yeong is clinging onto you?

00:47:59.356 --> 00:48:02.150
-That's not what I meant.
-Do you not even care about Ms. Go?

00:48:04.111 --> 00:48:06.571
Without knowing what sort of man
her husband is,

00:48:07.197 --> 00:48:09.241
she looks after her child
and even works full-time.

00:48:10.659 --> 00:48:13.412
Do you not even think about your wife,
who works tirelessly every day?

00:48:14.496 --> 00:48:15.539
You know,

00:48:16.248 --> 00:48:18.375
Ms. Go shows up to work
even on the weekends without complaint

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.128
and throws herself
into every difficult task.

00:48:22.254 --> 00:48:23.255
If it's a demanding task,

00:48:23.338 --> 00:48:25.465
she'll work through the night
to complete it perfectly.

00:48:27.634 --> 00:48:29.886
-All for her family.
-Mr. Gong.

00:48:30.512 --> 00:48:32.639
I know better than anyone

00:48:34.391 --> 00:48:36.268
how much Da-rim loves her family

00:48:37.352 --> 00:48:38.979
and how responsible she is.

00:48:39.938 --> 00:48:41.273
And I also…

00:48:42.983 --> 00:48:44.401
love Da-rim.

00:48:48.155 --> 00:48:49.865
I'll protect her until the end.

00:48:58.874 --> 00:49:00.250
This won't ever happen again.

00:49:00.333 --> 00:49:01.168
What if it does?

00:49:01.251 --> 00:49:02.169
It won't.

00:49:04.421 --> 00:49:05.422
Ever.

00:49:05.505 --> 00:49:07.507
If something like this ever happens again,

00:49:08.467 --> 00:49:09.760
I'll kill you…

00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:12.554
with my own hands.

00:49:20.312 --> 00:49:21.146
Let me ask you.

00:49:23.106 --> 00:49:24.649
Are you sure you're doing this

00:49:25.233 --> 00:49:27.110
purely because of Ms. Yu?

00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:32.783
Could there be another reason?

00:50:08.401 --> 00:50:09.277
You're late.

00:50:11.696 --> 00:50:12.572
Yeah.

00:50:12.656 --> 00:50:14.282
Jun is sleeping at my place.

00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:17.994
Hold on.

00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:20.247
Hey. What the heck?

00:50:20.956 --> 00:50:21.998
What happened to your lips?

00:50:29.422 --> 00:50:30.715
That stings.

00:50:30.799 --> 00:50:32.425
Just stay still.

00:50:32.509 --> 00:50:33.760
You need to suck it up. Come here.

00:50:39.933 --> 00:50:40.767
There.

00:50:45.856 --> 00:50:47.899
I saw the article about the engagement.

00:50:49.234 --> 00:50:51.528
I'm sorry for doubting you
and Mr. Gong last time.

00:50:52.696 --> 00:50:53.738
I overreacted.

00:50:54.531 --> 00:50:56.950
I told you there was nothing between us.

00:50:58.493 --> 00:50:59.494
It's…

00:51:01.413 --> 00:51:02.539
all over now.

00:51:06.376 --> 00:51:07.252
What is?

00:51:08.753 --> 00:51:10.589
I'm done applying the ointment.

00:51:12.215 --> 00:51:14.926
Right. Thank you.

00:51:15.010 --> 00:51:18.138
Did you really walk into a pole?

00:51:18.722 --> 00:51:20.140
You sure you didn't fight someone?

00:51:24.227 --> 00:51:25.061
Listen.

00:51:26.646 --> 00:51:28.315
-Da-rim.
-Yeah?

00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:31.484
The thing is,

00:51:33.111 --> 00:51:33.945
I have

00:51:34.821 --> 00:51:35.864
something to tell you.

00:51:35.947 --> 00:51:37.240
What is it?

00:51:38.617 --> 00:51:39.534
Well…

00:51:41.202 --> 00:51:44.289
I really thought about it a lot.

00:51:46.791 --> 00:51:47.959
I think…

00:51:57.719 --> 00:51:58.595
I…

00:52:02.557 --> 00:52:05.393
-So, I--
-I'm really sorry, but can you hurry up?

00:52:05.477 --> 00:52:06.811
I really need to use the bathroom.

00:52:10.982 --> 00:52:13.151
You should go. It's nothing important.

00:52:13.735 --> 00:52:16.947
-You sure? Then tell me later, okay?
-All right.

00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:18.490
Take Jun with you.

00:52:19.491 --> 00:52:20.784
Get some rest.

00:52:20.867 --> 00:52:21.701
Will do.

00:52:39.344 --> 00:52:40.762
Anything more concrete?

00:52:40.845 --> 00:52:43.556
These two were committing
all sorts of indecent acts

00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:45.392
behind closed doors,

00:52:45.475 --> 00:52:47.686
but they never even held hands outside.

00:52:47.769 --> 00:52:50.855
They're very good at hiding things
in public.

00:52:50.939 --> 00:52:52.357
Indecent acts?

00:52:53.984 --> 00:52:55.193
You sure they even did such things?

00:52:55.276 --> 00:52:56.111
Yes!

00:52:56.194 --> 00:52:57.779
They were in the room, and they were…

00:52:59.948 --> 00:53:01.950
My goodness, how do I put this?
It's so embarrassing.

00:53:02.033 --> 00:53:03.034
The two of them were…

00:53:03.743 --> 00:53:05.495
Just forget it. You can go now.

00:53:06.454 --> 00:53:07.288
Yes, ma'am.

00:53:19.884 --> 00:53:21.386
Like father, like son, huh?

00:53:24.097 --> 00:53:26.683
TEAM LEADER GONG JI-HYEOK

00:53:26.766 --> 00:53:30.145
THE QUADRUPLET FAMILY: WE FEEL REASSURED
WITH NATURAL BEBE BY OUR SIDE

00:53:34.858 --> 00:53:36.401
Can you take a look at this?

00:53:40.697 --> 00:53:42.991
You should go home early
if there's nothing urgent to take care of.

00:53:43.074 --> 00:53:44.284
Your engagement ceremony's tomorrow.

00:53:44.367 --> 00:53:46.119
I'm fine.

00:53:46.703 --> 00:53:49.497
You're clearly not. You look rough.

00:53:50.290 --> 00:53:51.207
Go home and rest.

00:53:51.291 --> 00:53:52.333
All right.

00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:08.641
Are you sure you're doing this

00:54:09.225 --> 00:54:11.144
purely because of Ms. Yu?

00:54:12.604 --> 00:54:14.189
Could there be another reason?

00:54:55.021 --> 00:54:56.272
Reconsider it.

00:54:57.107 --> 00:54:57.982
I want you

00:54:59.025 --> 00:55:02.779
to get married to someone you truly love.

00:55:28.221 --> 00:55:29.389
Da-rim.

00:55:29.472 --> 00:55:30.431
Hey, Seon-u.

00:55:30.932 --> 00:55:31.891
Jun!

00:55:33.101 --> 00:55:34.227
Where are you coming from?

00:55:34.310 --> 00:55:35.937
-Did you buy something?
-What?

00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:37.355
Oh, it's a suit for Jun.

00:55:37.438 --> 00:55:40.024
It's for Jae-dong's son's
first birthday party tomorrow.

00:55:40.108 --> 00:55:43.778
Jun, you're going to look so handsome.

00:55:43.862 --> 00:55:45.780
You must be so excited,
you little cutie pie.

00:55:47.115 --> 00:55:48.158
This is for you.

00:55:48.867 --> 00:55:50.243
-What?
-Shoes.

00:55:50.827 --> 00:55:52.078
Why would you buy me shoes?

00:55:52.162 --> 00:55:53.872
The ones you have looked pretty worn out.

00:55:53.955 --> 00:55:56.708
Seriously? Thank you.

00:55:56.791 --> 00:55:58.126
Wear them tomorrow.

00:55:58.209 --> 00:55:59.669
I heard they're going all out
at a fancy hotel.

00:55:59.752 --> 00:56:01.212
-Let's go.
-Oh my gosh, what a surprise.

00:56:01.296 --> 00:56:02.130
Jun, give me your hand.

00:56:03.089 --> 00:56:05.466
Jun, we should thank your dad.

00:56:05.550 --> 00:56:07.510
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:56:07.594 --> 00:56:08.595
One more time.

00:56:08.678 --> 00:56:10.680
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:56:10.763 --> 00:56:11.973
Thank you.

00:56:12.056 --> 00:56:13.433
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

00:56:16.102 --> 00:56:17.604
-That was fun, wasn't it? One more time?
-One more time?

00:56:17.687 --> 00:56:18.938
-Yes.
-Let's do it.

00:56:19.022 --> 00:56:20.523
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

00:56:23.693 --> 00:56:24.527
I'm so tired.

00:56:24.611 --> 00:56:26.487
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

00:57:06.819 --> 00:57:09.197
Buy me a drink too.

00:57:11.783 --> 00:57:12.992
What the…

00:57:13.076 --> 00:57:14.369
How did you know I was here?

00:57:14.452 --> 00:57:15.578
Do you even have to ask?

00:57:15.662 --> 00:57:17.330
You always go to the same places.

00:57:19.249 --> 00:57:21.376
You can't have a bachelor party
by yourself.

00:57:22.835 --> 00:57:23.878
We should party together.

00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:28.258
You little punk.

00:57:36.766 --> 00:57:37.850
Are you okay?

00:57:38.768 --> 00:57:39.894
What do you mean?

00:57:39.978 --> 00:57:41.312
It's a business wedding.

00:57:41.896 --> 00:57:43.356
I don't know
if I should congratulate you or not.

00:57:46.859 --> 00:57:47.819
Then again,

00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:50.029
seeing my older sisters

00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:53.157
made me realize that marriage
isn't something to be celebrated.

00:57:53.241 --> 00:57:55.535
My oldest sister dated her husband
for ten years, but they got divorced

00:57:55.618 --> 00:57:57.078
after a year of being married.

00:57:58.079 --> 00:57:59.789
My second oldest sister has three kids,

00:58:00.790 --> 00:58:03.710
but her husband cheated on her,
so they're fighting on the daily.

00:58:05.962 --> 00:58:08.006
You might actually be better off.

00:58:09.048 --> 00:58:11.259
You don't expect anything
from each other to begin with.

00:58:11.884 --> 00:58:13.303
There's no chance
for disappointment either.

00:58:17.056 --> 00:58:17.974
That's true.

00:58:18.474 --> 00:58:19.559
Yeah.

00:58:22.645 --> 00:58:24.397
-Okay!
-Okay!

00:58:26.649 --> 00:58:27.859
Slow down. Hold on.

00:58:29.027 --> 00:58:31.446
-Let's go for round two!
-You're so heavy.

00:58:31.529 --> 00:58:32.864
-Round two!
-Watch my neck. Hang on.

00:58:32.947 --> 00:58:33.823
Karaoke!

00:58:34.866 --> 00:58:36.492
Let's go to karaoke!

00:58:37.118 --> 00:58:37.952
Jump!

00:58:44.083 --> 00:58:47.587
I'm no longer that guy

00:58:47.670 --> 00:58:51.257
Who used to tear up
Whenever I saw your face

00:58:51.341 --> 00:58:54.302
Don't look at me like that

00:58:54.385 --> 00:58:58.139
Your cruelty only fills me with regret

00:58:58.222 --> 00:58:59.599
Let's go!

00:59:00.183 --> 00:59:02.101
But it's definitely over

00:59:02.185 --> 00:59:06.731
It only helped you forget me

00:59:06.814 --> 00:59:10.234
You would've been relieved

00:59:10.318 --> 00:59:13.446
That breaking up was the right call

00:59:14.572 --> 00:59:16.282
All right, start!

00:59:18.868 --> 00:59:24.082
As the sun sets, my footsteps take me away

00:59:24.165 --> 00:59:26.626
When I opened my eyes

00:59:27.210 --> 00:59:29.337
I found myself in a place

00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:32.006
That I thought I had forgotten

00:59:33.007 --> 00:59:36.302
Perhaps, I still have

00:59:36.386 --> 00:59:41.391
Some ill will towards you

00:59:41.474 --> 00:59:43.267
But now

00:59:43.351 --> 00:59:46.354
I want to be free

00:59:46.437 --> 00:59:52.235
Time will solve everything

00:59:52.318 --> 00:59:55.363
That's what I believed

00:59:55.446 --> 01:00:00.785
Maybe that was foolish of me

01:00:00.868 --> 01:00:02.286
Now

01:00:02.370 --> 01:00:05.373
I just want to let it all go…

01:01:14.525 --> 01:01:17.904
Jun, you're going to look so handsome.
You must be so excited.

01:01:17.987 --> 01:01:19.614
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

01:02:25.596 --> 01:02:28.474
We'll be starting in five minutes.
You can make your way to the hall now.

01:02:41.112 --> 01:02:42.738
This place is so nice.

01:02:57.128 --> 01:02:59.338
Auntie! Auntie Da-rim!

01:02:59.422 --> 01:03:01.173
Jun, there you are!

01:03:01.257 --> 01:03:02.133
Auntie!

01:03:09.765 --> 01:03:10.725
"Auntie"?

01:03:11.726 --> 01:03:13.060
Auntie Da-rim!

01:03:13.144 --> 01:03:14.687
-Oh my goodness.
-Jun, you're here!

01:03:14.770 --> 01:03:17.607
-Auntie!
-What?

01:03:18.441 --> 01:03:20.192
You scared me!

01:03:20.276 --> 01:03:22.486
Jun, should we check out that place later?

01:03:57.813 --> 01:04:02.735
DYNAMITE KISS

01:04:32.848 --> 01:04:34.517
Mom!

01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:38.896
Just focus on yourself
and follow your heart.

01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:40.815
And it turns out Ji-hyeok already knew

01:04:40.898 --> 01:04:42.274
that you two aren't married.

01:04:42.358 --> 01:04:44.652
What about Da-rim?
Does she know he knows? Is she okay?

01:04:44.735 --> 01:04:45.987
It's all over for me now.

01:04:46.070 --> 01:04:47.738
Who are you, really?

01:04:47.822 --> 01:04:49.323
Are you really Kim Seon-u's wife?

01:04:49.407 --> 01:04:53.035
I'll be taking care of Da-rim from now on.

01:04:53.119 --> 01:04:55.579
Mr. Gong, I'm in front of your place.

01:04:55.663 --> 01:04:57.707
Could you hear me out for a second?

01:05:02.044 --> 01:05:06.924
