00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:41.880
One dose every day

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.280
Take it in three separate doses

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.280
Why do I still have to drink this?

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.680
You're so badly hurt

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.000
You need to restore your energy

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.760
You don't want to drink it, do you?

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.240
Darn it, do you want a long life or not?

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.240
Then I'll throw it away

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.120
I'll drink it, I'll drink it

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.720
Martial Uncle heals the world

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.960
Saving me is just a small favor

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.640
It's just a flick of your finger

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.000
You sure know how to flatter

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.040
Thank you, Mr. Yu

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.320
Another day

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.840
I'll come again to thank you in person

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.280
No, no, no

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.880
I just don't like crowds

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.080
I prefer peace and quiet

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.600
But you clearly love lively company

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.960
You always invite me and Senior Sister to chat

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.840
What are you mumbling about?

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.600
I'm just grateful for Martial Uncle's kindness

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.640
Enough, stop talking

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.160
Let's hurry and get going

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.480
I'll visit often

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.440
There's nothing special here

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.680
It's just that

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.640
Sunsets are free

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.240
Spring, summer, autumn, winter

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.480
All of them

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.080
Take care of yourself

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.920
Farewell, Martial Uncle Yu

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.440
Let's go

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.080
Miss

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.080
Wanwan

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.560
Greetings, Father and Mother

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.800
You're in such a hurry

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.640
Where did you go?

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.600
A proper young lady

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.600
Shouldn't stay out all night

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.520
If word gets out, our family's reputation is ruined

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.760
Tell me, where did you go?

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.320
I spent last night in the palace

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.560
Then why didn't you send someone to inform us?

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.120
Your Majesty asked me to stay

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.920
So

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.600
Your Majesty

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.520
Did you two...

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.320
No

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.960
Your Majesty and I are completely innocent

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.520
We never crossed any boundaries

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.080
Your Majesty just asked me to review poetry

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.280
I forgot to send word home

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.360
I made Father and Mother worry

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.640
As your father

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.200
I worry about your safety

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.920
You must have been scared

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.120
You look so pale

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.120
Your Majesty too

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.880
Why don't you care about others at all?

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.920
Enough

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.560
Go back and rest now

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.560
Yes

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:04.760
Your daughter takes her leave

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.680
Go on, go on, go on

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.200
A good thing is about to happen

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.600
Qin Tian Jian said my Ba Zi is weak

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.800
The palace's feng shui is too strong

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.040
I'm easily affected by it

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.080
Someone like me

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.240
A princess as beautiful as a flower

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.040
If I were to die young

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.120
Royal Brother

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.080
Wouldn't you regret it?

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.640
Just say what you want

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.560
Rui Yu's residence has perfect feng shui

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.720
Second Brother Rui's Ba Zi matches mine

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.280
It's just right for me

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.240
To rest and recover

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:50.960
Royal Brother

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.840
My very, very, very best Royal Brother

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.560
Please let me go

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:57.240
I promise

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.600
I'll behave and stay at Rui's residence

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.840
And listen to Rui Yu

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:10.520
Your Majesty

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:11.600
Master Rui has arrived.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.240
Summon.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.320
Yes.

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:15.240
Summon.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.960
Master Rui requests an audience.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.960
She came on her own.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.760
Speak to her yourself.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.360
If she agrees,

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.320
I will let you leave the palace.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.000
Rui Yu definitely won't agree.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:29.520
Your Majesty

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.680
Princess

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:31.480
No need for formalities.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.880
The newly appointed Hanlin scholars

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.760
are still useful, aren't they?

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.720
They're all outstanding among the new generation.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.040
I am ashamed to be less than them.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.120
Too much humility

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.640
is just another form of boasting.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.080
Royal brother

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.600
Royal brother

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.680
Qin Tian Jian reports

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.200
that the Princess and you

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.600
have incompatible Ba Zi.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:52.760
Your fates clash.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:53.640
No, no.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.080
My Ba Zi is weak.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.760
I can't handle the palace's fortune.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:58.680
Besides,

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.080
I've been coughing a lot lately.

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:02.160
Look,

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.760
even the imperial physician

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.800
says there's no real cause.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.560
But still,

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:07.840
it can't be cured.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.200
It's all because of my Ba Zi.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.760
But with your family,

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.040
my Ba Zi matches unexpectedly.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:18.760
So,

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.400
can I move into your home?

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.080
Princess, you are of noble birth.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.480
My home is humble.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.520
How could I let you

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:29.520
It's not humble, not at all.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.680
It's much more interesting than my Xichun Garden.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.120
I swear here and now,

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.160
if I step out of Rui Manor,

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.360
may lightning strike me.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.240
No.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:42.880
Rui Yu

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.360
You tell me.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.760
The Princess knows Chen Xiao's identity.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.600
If she helps cover for you,

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.360
others won't dare to ask questions.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.920
Everything will follow Your Majesty's orders.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.120
Just this once.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.360
If you cause trouble,

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.720
you'll never leave the palace again.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.960
Then I won't marry.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.720
Mother can't bear to part with you anyway.

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.360
I will be careful with my words and actions.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.240
I won't cause any trouble.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.840
You must also listen to Rui Yu.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:11.920
If she tells you to go east,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.120
you can't go west.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:13.960
No problem.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.320
I'll go pack my things now.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.760
See you tomorrow, Rui Yu.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.280
Take care, Princess.

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.440
It's all because of your second brother.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.080
My little sister

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.000
keeps coming up with more tricks.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.720
If Your Majesty lets the Princess leave,

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.040
she'll see my second brother even more often.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.080
I don't care.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:37.800
Any trouble you cause

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.200
must be cleaned up for me.

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.240
I obey Your Majesty's command.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.360
Be careful not to bump into anything.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:46.880
This is fine redwood.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.240
I brought all these from the palace.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.120
Be careful, everyone.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.480
I'm not hard to please.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.200
As long as you do well,

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.280
you'll all be rewarded.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:55.760
Yes, yes.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:56.560
Princess

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.200
Our place is small.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.960
We can't host someone as grand as you.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.120
Rui Manor is so big,

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.360
but only you and Rui Yu live here.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.800
Isn't it boring?

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.280
One more person won't matter.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.200
The Princess staying here

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.840
is your greatest honor.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.360
The Princess left the palace without permission

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.080
and moved into a minister's home.

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.720
How can my family explain this to the court?

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:20.920
Yes.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.320
This is an imperial decree.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:25.640
Rise.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.640
Just know I have royal permission.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:30.800
Rui Yu

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.240
Greetings, Princess.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.320
Why has the Princess come?

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.680
And brought so many things?

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.560
Looks like the Princess plans to stay long.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.400
Be careful, everyone.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:44.640
What should we do?

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:47.560
Princess

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:48.960
If you need anything,

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.360
just tell the steward.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.520
No problem at all.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.800
Where is Rui Wang?

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:56.560
Rui Wang

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.480
He lives at the main house.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:09:59.480
He doesn't visit here often.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:00.320
That's not right.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.520
You two are brothers.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.880
You should see each other often.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:03.600
So,

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:04.840
starting tomorrow,

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.520
have him come here for meals every day.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.080
If I happen to be

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.680
in a good mood,

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.720
I'll even cook myself.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:12.480
Princess

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.480
Don't tell me you like the second brother.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.440
How could I like someone bad

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:20.680
and unreasonable?

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:28.520
So much fine timber.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:28.920
Yes.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.280
It wasn't easy to transport, was it?

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.680
This is quite a large amount.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:35.080
It'll take a while to count it all.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.600
How about the payment for this batch—

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.560
we settle it tomorrow instead?

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.000
That wouldn't be proper.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:40.960
This isn't like other goods.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.200
You can't just store it at the post station.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.360
Except for our warehouse,

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.800
nowhere else can hold it.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.040
If you're really worried,

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:47.760
tonight you can—

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:48.760
No, no, no.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.120
Let's do as you suggested.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:51.880
That's the right way.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:53.320
Tonight,

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.880
I'll get you some good food and drinks.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:55.440
Right?

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.680
I know all the best places to eat and have fun in Ling An.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.080
I'm the most familiar here.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:10:59.560
Let's go.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:00.320
Alright.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.560
How did a perfectly fine warehouse

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:07.720
end up catching fire?

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.520
How do you people handle things?

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.680
Are you all just useless eaters?

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.560
Why isn't Rui Yu back yet?

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:17.520
Father.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:18.920
Stop pacing in front of me.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.040
Rui Yu went to the palace to report.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.680
Why didn't you go with her?

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:23.680
Father.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.480
What status do I have?

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:26.640
How could I enter the palace?

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.000
That's why you're useless.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:29.720
You can't earn a title.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.280
Now we can only rely on Rui Yu.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:31.720
Yes.

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:32.840
I'm useless.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:34.080
Father.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:35.560
Calm down.

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.520
There's still a chance to turn things around.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.600
It's already dark.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.600
Rui Yu has been at the palace all day.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:45.640
We still don't know

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.840
how much scolding she's endured.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.160
If your mother is watching from above,

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.560
and knew about this,

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.840
she'd be heartbroken.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:57.800
Rui Yu.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:58.400
Father.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.080
Everyone's here.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:02.600
Saves me from calling you all from each courtyard.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:04.600
How did it go?

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:05.480
Rui Yu.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.680
Why are your hands so cold?

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.600
I caught a chill on the way.

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.000
It's nothing serious.

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:13.240
Rui Yu.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.440
You weren't scolded by Your Majesty, were you?

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.200
Rui Yu.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.880
About the warehouse fire—

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:23.600
how was it handled?

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.120
This matter

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.000
started with the Rui family

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.760
and must end with the Rui family.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:33.840
As long as the Rui family pays

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.600
this sum,

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.320
the account will be settled.

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.320
Settle the account?

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.360
How much will that cost?

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.160
Three hundred taels.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.520
Three hundred taels?

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.000
How could it be so cheap?

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:53.920
Gold.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.080
Gold?

00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.400
Father, father!

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:00.680
Father, are you alright?

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:01.520
Are you okay?

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:02.080
How is he?

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:06.880
Seriously,

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.400
we'll have to tighten our belts.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.440
We'll dismiss some servants

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.480
to cut costs.

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:16.520
Father's

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.360
and elder brother's collections

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:19.840
must all be pawned.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.120
Then,

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.280
we'll scrape together some silver from the palace.

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:24.520
Only then can we settle the account.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.640
If we can resolve this,

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.600
that would be good.

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.080
Let's go back and pack up.

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:34.960
Tomorrow, together with the family collections,

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:36.560
we'll sell them all.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:37.960
Go on.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.240
Father.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.000
Go ahead.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.280
Let's go, let's head back.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:03.680
It's truly hard to bear.

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.200
I was terrified when Father almost collapsed.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.000
But

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:08.920
if Father and elder brother knew the truth,

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:09.880
they'd never let us go through with it.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:11.680
You two

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:12.800
acted pretty well just now.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.560
I almost couldn't hold it together.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.760
Why were you in the palace so long?

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.240
I could barely keep Father calm.

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:19.840
We had to put on a show.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.720
I'll leave the pawning to you.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:27.400
Rui Yu,

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:29.840
I'm still your elder brother, aren't I?

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:31.560
When you ask for help,

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:33.600
you should at least act like you need it.

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.320
Is it so hard to call me Second Brother?

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.080
Here we go again.

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.480
It's just a title.

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:41.600
Or do you want to be the elder sister?

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:42.480
Me?

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:45.600
Why not?

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.040
Forget it, forget it.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.800
You can trust me to handle it.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:53.600
As the saying goes,

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.440
plan in the command tent,

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.080
win battles a thousand miles away.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:58.360
Besides,

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.040
we're just going through the motions.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.240
It's all for show.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.920
The money and deeds will end up back with us.

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.360
It's a good chance

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:08.400
to take the old man

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.000
and elder brother's useless trinkets

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:10.920
and confiscate them all.

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:13.120
The house will be peaceful for a few days.

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.200
But handling this so easily—

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.480
don't you suspect Sister-in-law?

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.560
I keep thinking Pan Zi Zhai is behind this.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:24.480
What he dislikes most

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:26.080
is Ling An and Pingxiang getting along.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.400
He hasn't visited our residence in days.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.280
Now that we're in trouble,

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:32.600
we can close our doors to guests.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.520
Just cut off contact.

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:42.840
What are you doing?

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.400
I asked Fu Lv to help me with my makeup.

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.520
So I look a bit more worn out.

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.080
You little rascal.

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:56.040
Too bad I can't get a closer look.

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:58.120
This girl...

00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:59.680
Her skills have slipped lately.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.280
Stop messing around.

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:06.560
Rui Yu and I

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:07.840
just tried out

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.080
disguise techniques.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:09.800
Enough.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:10.960
Go back quickly.

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:13.560
Or they'll start getting suspicious.

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:14.880
Alright.

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.080
We'll leave now and come back tomorrow morning.

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:18.440
Go on.

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:19.440
Let's go.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:20.360
Go.

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:22.560
We're leaving.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.080
Your Majesty.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.240
What's so urgent?

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:39.160
The warehouse storing the timber was burned.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.400
Did you notify Pingxiang?

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.600
My eldest and second brothers have gone to calm things down.

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.120
The real timber

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.440
has already been secretly

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.480
moved to my residence by Chen Xiao.

00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.960
Now all of Ling An knows

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.480
it was the Rui family's mistake

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.480
that led to the timber being destroyed.

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:07.360
It's the perfect time to stir things up.

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:08.360
How do you plan

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:11.040
to play your part in this drama?

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:32.680
Big brother,

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.240
there will be a chance in the future

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:36.440
to recover these items.

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:40.880
Don't let hobbies ruin your ambition.

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:42.120
From now on,

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:43.360
I'll help Lanzhi

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:44.760
and Steward Chen Xiao.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.160
I'll teach the furniture to make craftsmen—

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:47.960
No,

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.040
teach craftsmen to make furniture.

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:51.080
I'll try

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:52.840
to earn a chance to make up for my mistakes.

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.320
It's good that you think this way.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Family matters

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.200
aren't your concern.

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.360
Three hundred taels of gold

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:03.600
to bring you back to your senses—

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.400
I wonder if it's worth it.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:09.680
Of course it's worth it.

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.880
As long as we work together as a family,

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.120
we'll earn it back.

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:14.960
The sun is blazing.

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:16.880
You should hurry back and rest.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.400
You two sure have a lot of stuff.

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:30.520
You only brought one bundle.

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.600
All my things are at Rui Yu's place.

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:35.040
Besides,

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.360
only my boxes of storybooks are worth anything.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.400
Let's all disperse.

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:43.960
Rui Yu has worked hard.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.600
So has my brother and sister-in-law.

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:49.440
Rui Yu has left.

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:55.880
With the Rui family like this now,

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.640
we'll have to tighten our belts and pretend.

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.440
It's hard on you.

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:02.680
Don't say that.

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.320
We as husband and wife

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:05.480
share honor together,

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:06.560
and loss together.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.120
Besides,

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:09.680
this isn't a big deal.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.040
Rui Yu's courtyard

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.400
is really huge, isn't it?

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.200
Yes.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:15.760
Look,

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:16.720
it'd be nice to put some flowers here.

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:18.840
It's too plain, nothing here.

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:20.280
Look at this wood carving.

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:20.800
It's too plain.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.120
Yes, not as good as big brother's carving.

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:22.880
If I carved it—

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.400
You scared me, you really scared me!

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:28.760
Brother Rui Wang!

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:29.400
Prin—

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.000
Who is this?

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:33.280
You're the eldest brother?

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:34.280
Who are you?

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:36.360
Who?

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:37.960
She doesn't look like a maid.

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:40.400
She's Rui Yu's new concubine.

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.040
I am not!

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:43.960
She's Princess Chunxi.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:45.880
Greetings, Princess.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.200
I—

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.400
Never mind, big brother, no need for formalities.

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:51.560
I'm just staying here for now.

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:53.200
While I'm here, keep things simple.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:53.960
No need to be formal.

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:55.160
Alright.

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.120
Why did you leave the palace to live here?

00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.480
Why are you dressed like this?

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.240
Why are you all asking me?

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.840
Didn't your storybooks say

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.520
a princess with weak Ba Zi

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.520
can stay at a minister's house with strong Ba Zi?

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:09.840
I just asked Qin Tian Jian to check for me.

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:12.200
And I heard you were coming,

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.000
so I—

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.440
I made all that up!

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:15.680
But I asked Wanwan,

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:17.720
she said a princess did this in the previous dynasty, so I—

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:20.440
What,

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:21.400
are you angry?

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.840
If the Princess is willing to stay with us,

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.240
it's the greatest honor for the Rui family.

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.880
From now on, we'll be family.

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:30.560
Don't you think so?

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:31.600
What family?

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.440
Is it proper to say that to the Princess?

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:34.600
Why not?

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:36.520
I get it now.

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:37.960
You just don't want to see me.

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:38.560
Let's go.

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:39.880
Pack up, we're leaving now.

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:40.680
It's not that I don't want to.

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:41.280
Princess.

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.240
What are you looking at? Go after her!

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:47.760
Why should I chase her?

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:48.960
She wants to return to the palace.

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:50.160
That's a good thing.

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.000
I say you're thick-headed.

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.760
Aren't you usually smart?

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.560
Why can't you figure this out now?

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.400
I know this better than you.

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:58.000
This—

00:20:58.280 --> 00:20:59.920
Isn't this a mismatch of status?

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:03.800
Take it.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:05.440
No.

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:12.920
I must owe him from a past life.

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:16.200
This Rui family, inside and out,

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:17.400
not a single one is easy.

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.520
Without me, this family would've fallen apart.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:33.440
Your Highness

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:36.640
The Rui family, to make up for the timber loss,

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:38.720
sold a large number of antiques and paintings.

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:40.680
I heard

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:44.800
Rui Yu was scolded all day yesterday
by Your Majesty of Ling An.

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.360
It was quite embarrassing.

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.880
Those items the Rui family sold—

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:56.040
Would Your Highness like to buy them?

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:56.720
No need.

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.240
When I

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:01.960
become Prince Qian Yuan,

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:03.800
getting her, a woman,

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.160
will be a piece of cake.

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:11.600
But I should pay them a visit.

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:14.560
The Rui family has closed their doors to guests.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.240
I heard the princess is staying at the Rui residence.

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:20.000
Miss Ming tried to visit but was refused.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:23.560
Why did this news arrive so late?

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.520
I only heard when I visited Minister Ming at the Ming residence.

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:41.880
Keep a close watch on the Rui residence.

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:43.760
Any news,

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:45.600
report to me at once.

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:47.440
Yes, Your Highness.

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:47.960
Go.

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:19.120
Travel permit.

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:28.720
Go in.

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.000
Because of this,

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:49.400
you can rest at home for a few more days.

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:53.280
Who knows how much paperwork will pile up.

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:55.880
Just thinking about it gives me a headache.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:57.880
Sir

00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:58.560
Young Master

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.120
The general suddenly reported

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:01.960
that several people dressed in Western attire

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.600
tried to enter the city without a permit.

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:05.560
They clashed with the city guards.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:06.560
People from the Western border?

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:07.400
Yes.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:08.880
At this time of year,

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:11.200
Wu Rong and Da Yue are fighting over water sources.

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.520
Why would they suddenly visit Ling An?

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.320
Maybe

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.800
they ended their conflict early.

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:21.680
Quick, help me change.

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:22.800
I need to go to the palace.

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:23.800
I'll call Liang Jin.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:25.960
Come here.

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:27.960
Why are you in such a rush?

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:32.000
Hurry up.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:32.960
Why are you here?

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:34.840
Brother Nan

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.480
Rui Yu asked me

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:37.960
to deliver the checkpoint map for the route.

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:40.320
Let's go.

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:41.400
Let's catch up properly.

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:42.080
Alright.

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:49.880
That sly fox only knows how to bully people.

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.120
And I just can't win an argument with you.

00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:56.440
Darn it, I'm so mad.

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.520
Princess, what's wrong?

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:16.160
Do you really not know how I feel?

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:32.320
Fine, I'll leave.

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:33.920
I don't care if we never meet again.

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:07.920
Rouge not evenly blended,

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:10.000
idle flowers with a faint scent.

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:13.000
You look beautiful even without makeup.

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:15.840
Why are you arranging these flowers in the courtyard?

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.120
They say this is called the Cold Fragrance Pavilion,

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:19.480
but there isn't a single flower.

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:20.840
That's really not fitting.

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.800
But

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.560
I'm going back to the palace.

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:27.440
Go back if you want.

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:29.240
If you leave, I'll move in.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:31.880
I don't want to live next to my big brother anyway.

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:32.560
He's so noisy.

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:34.240
You just have to annoy me, don't you?

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:37.800
It's really inconvenient for you to stay here.

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.360
What if you accidentally say something you shouldn't?

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:40.760
Wouldn't that cause trouble for Chen Xiao?

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:42.480
After all, you still—

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:43.760
No, I don't like him.

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:46.560
I only liked the character in your storybook.

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.320
How could I like someone so fierce?

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:52.320
If you don't want to leave,

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:53.680
then maybe I should consider

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:55.480
putting up with my big brother.

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:58.800
If I stay here,

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:00.880
will you be happy?

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:03.160
I...

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:07.960
Of course I'd be happy.

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:12.320
If that's the case,

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:15.080
then this princess will stay.

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.880
What kind of flowers are these?

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.600
They smell wonderful.

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:22.200
Do you like them?

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:23.760
I do.

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:27.640
I'm hungry.

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:30.320
Let's go.

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:31.360
I'll take you to get something to eat.

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:34.600
Let's go.

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:41.240
King Wu Rong and Princess Wu Rong request an audience.

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:54.600
Your Majesty of Ling An

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:56.240
Just as the rumors said,

00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.000
young and accomplished indeed.

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:01.680
The Prince of Wu Rong visits Ling An

00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:03.200
for what purpose?

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:06.080
I have come in person

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:08.000
to search for a certain young man.

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:11.160
He is an honored guest of Wu Rong

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:13.840
and Princess Mu Ya's husband.

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:15.000
Moreover,

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:18.400
he is the general who brings fortune to Wu Rong.

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:21.520
But I do not know his full name.

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.840
Why is he in Ling An's capital?

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.280
His name is

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:26.600
Bei Cheng.

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:27.800
Bei.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:28.840
He told me

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:30.880
his home is in Ling An's capital.

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:32.760
As for his age,

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.800
he looks about twenty-four or twenty-five.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:37.360
If not for our conflict with Da Yue,

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:39.640
he would not have been ambushed by Da Yue.

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:40.800
He would not have

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:42.760
fled toward Ling An's capital.

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:45.880
Ling An has countless talented youths.

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.160
With just these clues,

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.120
it will be hard to find him.

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:50.960
You only need to announce

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:53.240
that my sister, Princess Mu Ya of Wu Rong,

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:56.880
is seeking her fiancé, General Bei Cheng.

00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:58.360
I believe

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:00.240
news will come soon.

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:01.000
Also,

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:02.600
I came to Ling An

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:05.000
to fulfill my promise to him.

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:07.280
I have come in person

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:09.960
to sign an alliance with Ling An.

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:12.280
Hearing the Prince of Wu Rong,

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:14.640
this Bei Cheng,

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.400
must truly be a remarkable talent.

00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:19.160
Are you not afraid I won't let him go?

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:24.080
We Wu Rong people travel far and wide.

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:25.920
We've seen all kinds of situations.

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:27.920
I came in person

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.240
to show

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:30.400
my

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:33.240
respect for General Bei Cheng

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:34.200
and

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:35.320
my sincerity

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:38.000
in forming an alliance with Ling An.

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:45.440
Prince of Wu Rong, do not worry.

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:47.240
If it's just searching for someone,

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.760
Ling An will gladly help.

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:54.000
If he cannot achieve here in Ling An,

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:57.000
he may succeed in Wu Rong.

00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.720
An alliance between Wu Rong and Ling An

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:02.480
benefits both our nations.

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:05.520
I ask Your Majesty to give it your attention.

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:06.880
Very well.

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:08.280
Since you are here,

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:11.040
please settle in and rest.

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:13.480
Once you are refreshed,

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:15.640
I will ask Lord Rui

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:17.880
to show you around the capital.

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:19.000
How does that sound?

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.320
I've never lost my way on the endless grasslands.

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:24.840
In this square city of Ling An,

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:26.120
how could I possibly get lost?

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000
Since Your Majesty insists,

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:32.840
we'll trouble Lord Rui then.

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.520
But we've traveled for days and are tired.

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:36.760
Would a few days later be alright?

00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:38.400
Princess, you are too polite.

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:40.040
Then on another day,

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.240
I'll come to the Four Directions Hall to fetch you.

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.280
Bei Cheng

00:30:58.440 --> 00:30:59.680
I did not know

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:02.080
Ling An had such a talent.

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:03.400
Lord Rui,

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:05.800
arrange for people at once

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:08.200
to search for Bei Cheng.

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:09.720
Continue alliance talks as planned.

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:12.080
If he truly cannot be found,

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.520
it must not affect our alliance.

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:15.840
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:17.840
I will go prepare immediately.

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:19.640
I will do my utmost to find

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:21.040
Bei Cheng.

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.520
Just tell me.

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:26.760
Hurry, tell me!

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:30.080
See, I've been following you all along.

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:31.160
Why won't you tell me?

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:32.880
I've been talking all morning.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.760
My throat is already sore.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.320
What more do you want me to say?

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.000
So boring.

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:46.000
Young Master Nan,

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:47.840
why not teach me boxing?

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:49.640
Then I can protect myself outside.

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:52.600
Let Second Brother teach you.

00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:56.680
You know martial arts?

00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.240
I've traveled everywhere,

00:31:58.280 --> 00:31:59.560
so I learned some self-defense.

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:00.920
But it's all just basics.

00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:01.840
I can't really teach you.

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:02.760
I don't believe you.

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:03.960
You love to lie.

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:05.360
Come on, let's go to the training ground.

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:06.400
Princess, I'm not lying.

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:07.800
I only know a little.

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:11.000
Why are you back so soon?

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:13.240
The Prince of Wu Rong didn't trouble you, right?

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:13.960
No.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.280
They just said they're looking for someone.

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:18.360
They came to Ling An for this person.

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:20.520
Who is it?

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:23.120
To make the Prince of Wu Rong mobilize like this?

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:26.600
They said it's a general named Bei Cheng.

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:28.400
I've been an official for years,

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:30.960
but never heard of this name.

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:33.440
Bei Cheng?

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:36.760
Do you know him?

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:38.440
No.

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:41.200
I just think the name is odd.

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:42.880
They also said

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:45.600
General Bei Cheng is Princess Mu Ya's husband.

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:48.000
He went missing after being attacked.

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:50.600
That's all the clues they gave.

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:52.280
How am I supposed to help them find him?

00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:55.600
Maybe they won't find him

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:56.520
and just leave.

00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:59.520
I'm afraid it won't be that easy.
