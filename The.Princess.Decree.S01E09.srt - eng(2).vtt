You have rushed here

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.439
to save him.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.359
It's a pity

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.200
that things didn't go as you wished.

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:50.200
You have always upheld justice,

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:52.040
yet you would resort
to vigilante measures,

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.040
taking lives at will.

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:55.120
That's incorrect.

00:01:55.519 --> 00:01:57.400
Vice Minister Wang committed suicide.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.439
What does that have to do with me?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.280
Tell me

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:04.159
why he committed suicide.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.519
This sword was bestowed
by the late emperor.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.360
Seeing it
is like seeing the late emperor.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.360
The late emperor's authority
still lingers.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.159
I guess

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.280
Vice Minister Wang
was too ashamed to live,

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.919
so he sought death to atone his sins

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:17.560
and ask for forgiveness.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.159
Official Li, you

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.159
can truly twist the facts.

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:25.599
You flatters me.

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:27.919
I'm not even half as good as you.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:31.879
If you have any tricks left,

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:33.159
feel free to use them.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.960
I'm ready.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.039
You're really full of surprises.

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:45.599
It truly makes me

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.439
regret deeply.

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:52.479
I really regret

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:55.599
not having some fun with you back then.

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.199
I missed out on so much amusement.

00:02:58.919 --> 00:02:59.560
What?

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.599
In just a few days

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.479
after putting on this court robe,

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.800
you already forgot

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.719
your time at Princess Royal's residence?

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.840
Want me to jog your memory?

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:14.919
I didn't expect you to be the one

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:17.039
who cannot forget.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.199
What are you trying to prove
by humiliating me?

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.960
Proving you're no longer
the Xiao Pingning of five years ago.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.599
Proving

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:28.080
that all you brought back
from Beijiang was hatred?

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.240
But Your Highness,

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:32.280
hatred clouds the eyes.

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:34.479
Protecting such worms

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.680
and colluding
with wolves like Gan Sheng,

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.240
aren't you afraid

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.000
it will backfire?

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:43.360
Who are you to say that to me?

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:47.960
You want to kill me, right?

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.319
Yes.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.439
Is there anything that you care about?

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:56.560
Let alone human lives.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.639
(It's Gan Sheng's informant.)

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.680
Would you care about the life of an ant?

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:07.639
What if it were millions?

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.080
You can kill me,

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:14.919

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.920

Mr. Qingya is here in the capital.

He simply refuses to appear.

Likely unwilling to meet.

Unexpectedly,

00:08:47.639 --> 00:08:49.159
I have lost again today.

I

am truly ashamed.

You're too modest.

00:08:59.879 --> 00:09:00.950
Those caught in the game

00:09:01.799 --> 00:09:03.200
are easily blinded by the moment.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.080
Only by stepping outside it

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.480
can one see the full picture.

00:09:08.039 --> 00:09:11.159
Thank you for enlightening me.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.600
No need to thank me.

Had you

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.240
not helped me a year ago,

Gan Sheng

00:09:18.159 --> 00:09:20.360
would never trust me as he did now.

You're compassionate and righteous,
carrying the world on your shoulders.

00:09:24.879 --> 00:09:27.519
I naturally should aid you.

00:09:28.279 --> 00:09:29.159
Master,

00:09:30.679 --> 00:09:34.279
what if my actions were driven
by selfish intent a year ago?

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.960
Would you regret helping me?

00:09:37.399 --> 00:09:38.159

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:44.440
saving one person and saving the world
are no different.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.159
How is that selfish?

00:09:46.639 --> 00:09:48.159
I just wonder

00:09:48.879 --> 00:09:51.559
if you've obtained what you sought.

00:09:57.919 --> 00:09:59.080
Perhaps

00:10:00.919 --> 00:10:02.600
there is no way to get what one wants.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.240
Why'd he come back so quickly

00:10:28.399 --> 00:10:29.360
and even ask to meet you?

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:30.639
This isn't Zhou.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.120
The handwriting may be Zhou's,

00:10:34.559 --> 00:10:35.559
but we agreed

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.000
we only sign with our aliases.

00:10:37.279 --> 00:10:38.840
This letter uses his real name.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.279
It's obviously fake.

00:10:41.279 --> 00:10:42.080
Gan Sheng...

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.120
Gan Sheng has been

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.679
repeatedly asking around about you.

00:10:44.879 --> 00:10:45.919
Could this be his trap?

00:10:47.519 --> 00:10:49.000
He must be getting desperate.

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:50.399
If he's using such a method,

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.679
he has bad intentions.

00:10:52.039 --> 00:10:52.600
Yuanze.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:53.990
Think this through.

00:10:56.759 --> 00:10:58.360
Since Gan Sheng trusts Mr. Qingya,

00:10:58.639 --> 00:10:59.519
why not make use of it

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:00.940
and hold him in check?

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.080
But

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.399
if he finds out,

00:11:03.759 --> 00:11:04.519
your safety...

00:11:04.879 --> 00:11:05.799
As long as we win,

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.519
so what if I step into the game myself?
