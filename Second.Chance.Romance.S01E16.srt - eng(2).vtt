00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:39.060
so busy lately.

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:40.300
Turns out you were working on this.

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:41.620
We will collaborate

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:43.060
on the development together.

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:45.020
The commercial development
in the East District

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:46.180
has always been a major issue.

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:47.660
I want to build

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:49.180
a large,

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:50.620
top-tier stadium on this land

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:52.620
to host domestic
and international events

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:53.380
and concerts.

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:56.420
It could enhance the city's profile.

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:58.700
This would boost local tax revenue

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:00.140
and stimulate tourism.

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:01.380
Mr. Sun,

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:02.660
if

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:04.020
what you described

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:06.060
for the East District can be realized,

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:07.780
it would improve the quality of life

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:09.300
for the residents there.

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:11.380
Also, I grew up there.

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:12.620
So I know the area very well.

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:13.780
Really?

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:16.300
Give us some suggestions then.

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.260
I wouldn't say suggestions.

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:20.380
But

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:21.820
I did understand the content

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:23.300
of your conversation

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:24.500
with Zu just now.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.520
[Hongyuan - Chengdu,
Yinzhu West Road Stop]

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:47.940
Here.

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:53.140
Duoji.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:54.780
It's been ages.

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:55.900
It's been a while.

00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:56.780
Duoji.

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:57.900
So happy to see you.

00:14:58.180 --> 00:14:58.660
Thank you.

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:01.940
Still driving this old car?

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:02.900
Yeah.

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:04.660
It's really tough.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:05.660
Let's go.

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:06.060
Alright.

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:06.540
Alright.

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:07.260
Take it slow.

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:08.700
We can talk on the road.

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:09.300
Okay.

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:21.540
Ms. Tan,

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:22.420
do you feel like

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:24.180
things have changed a lot here
since your last visit?

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:25.140
Yes.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.140
The changes are really significant.

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:29.260
The road conditions
are much better than before.

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:30.980
And the streets

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:32.020
are livelier than they used to be.

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:34.020
We get more and more tourists now.

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:35.140
I feel like there are more tourists here

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:36.700
than locals nowadays.

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:38.020
Duoji,

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:40.300
your Mandarin has improved.

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:41.780
I remember when I came
thirteen years ago,

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:43.620
your Mandarin wasn't as good
as it is now.

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:46.620
I've been working and learning
with Mr. Feng

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:47.420
all these years,

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:49.780
and I've been interacting
with the Han people a lot.

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:51.780
So I've probably improved a bit.

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:53.780
Forgot to tell you.

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:56.180
Duoji has been handling
external relations

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:58.020
for our vineyard for the past few years.

00:15:59.060 --> 00:15:59.500
Right.

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:00.540
Ms. Tan,

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:03.380
it's been over ten years.
You've really changed so much.

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:04.300
I just saw

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:05.780
our photo

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:07.820
from thirteen years ago.

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:09.060
The group photo on the mountain peak.

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:10.420
You've changed

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:11.820
so much.

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:13.020
Mr. Feng,

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:14.540
that's the photo you dug out

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.380
from under the mudslide debris.

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:17.140
Remember?

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:25.500
Duoji,

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:27.180
how is the search for that man going?

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:29.540
After we hung up,

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:31.540
I started contacting all my friends.

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:32.900
I've asked around.

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:35.300
But only people at the contact station
have seen him so far.

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:36.780
Because he handles our deliveries

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:37.900
through the contact station.

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:40.500
I've already contacted the people there.

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:42.300
So are we going
to the contact station now?

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:44.020
Probably not today.

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:45.260
It takes at least five or six hours

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:46.180
to get there from here.

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:48.540
So we'll go to the hotel first.

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:50.020
Then we'll head over tomorrow morning.

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:51.300
It's fine.

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:54.020
They work there every day,
so they probably won't be gone.

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:55.020
Right.

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:56.140
Besides, Ms. Tan,

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:57.660
you must rest well on the first day.

00:16:58.020 --> 00:16:59.540
Or altitude sickness can be serious.

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:01.420
I brought some medicine,

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:03.060
but I hope we won't need it.

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:04.540
Thank you, Duoji.

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:05.260
No problem.

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:07.780
Also, we have a saying here.

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:09.300
If you see colorful clouds

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:11.300
on a rainless day,

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.140
it's a very good sign.

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:14.660
I saw colorful clouds

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:15.780
when I came to pick you up.

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:17.140
I believe we will definitely

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:18.300
find Mr. Tan this time.

00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:19.780

are you off work yet?

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:12.420
Is piano class still on today?

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:16.060
I've been quite busy

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:17.620
with classes lately.

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:19.620
I'll make up

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:21.540
your piano lessons later.

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:23.420
Practice the pieces
you already know for now.

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:25.820
You sound a bit unwell.

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:29.020
No.

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:31.020
I probably just

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:32.900
haven't rested well.

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:34.420
I have a bit of a cold.

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:37.380
Did you take any medicine?

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:38.780
Do you want me to go with you
to see a doctor?

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:39.900
Don't bother.

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:43.020
I'll visit you after I've rested
and gotten better.

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:44.940
If I go now, I might get you sick.

did Ms. Wen say?

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:14.940
She said she has a cold.

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:16.300
Her voice sounded stuffy.

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:18.820
And?

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:22.060
I asked if she wanted me
to go to the doctor with her.

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:23.180
She said no.

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:24.300
She just wants to sleep more.

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:43.660

But try not to eat too much

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:45.780
What bugs?

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:47.580
The ones the Ghost Pupil users reported.

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:48.860
Isn't that normal?

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:50.020
Exactly.

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:52.060
Seems Mr. Wang is in a really bad mood.

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:53.580
Probably not because of the game bugs.

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:56.660
Okay. I got it.

00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:58.060
You all get back to work.

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:08.020
What's going on, Mr. Wang?

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:09.780
The Tech Department
is working overtime today.

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:10.660
What are you doing here?

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:12.740
They're working overtime.

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:13.260
Is there a problem

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:14.100
with me being here?

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:16.540
What's wrong?

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:18.540
Are you in a bad mood?

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:20.860
I'm in a great mood.

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:21.860
By the way,

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:23.660
did we fix the lag issue

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:26.340
when the main character picks up coins
in Ghost Pupil that the client

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:27.340
reported yesterday?

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:29.060
Had Rookie fix it right away.

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:32.340
Don't make these basic mistakes again.

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:35.060
Ghost Pupil is one
of our most polished products.

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:36.060
Come on,

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:37.200
we just had the first major update

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.500
for the new season
the day before yesterday.

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:39.580
Every major update

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:40.380
has a few minor bugs.

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:42.660
And it was just a few code issues.

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:43.620
Easily fixed.

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:45.020
Minor issues, minor issues.

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:45.860
They're always "minor issues"!

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:48.300
If they really are,

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:48.860
then please

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:50.340
tell Rookie and the others
to be more careful.

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:51.420
One mistake,

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:53.340
and all our previous hard work
could be wasted.

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:56.060
Alright.

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:56.780
I get it.

00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:58.380
We won't make
that kind of mistake again.

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:00.500
Get back to work.

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:17.860
Hello?

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:18.660
Dad.

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:19.940
Where are you?

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:21.700
I'm on a business trip.

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:23.020
Something urgent came up.

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:26.100
The signal here is spotty.

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:26.980
Just leave me a message.

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.780
I just called Ms. Wen.

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:32.940
She's sick.

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:34.260
She sounded really weak.

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:36.260
Then

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:38.540
make sure she rests properly.

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:41.180
Can you be more considerate?

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:42.740
Show some concern for her.

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:45.100
Focus on your homework.

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:46.940
You're so clueless.

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:53.060
Here.

00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:56.700
What did your dad say?

00:23:58.020 --> 00:23:59.500
He said he's on a business trip.

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:10.740
Dad!

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:11.140
Who is it?

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:11.700
Who is it?

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:12.860
Sorry.

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:13.620
I mistook you for someone else.

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:14.380
It's fine.

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:15.180
Sorry.

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:09.940
Look at me.

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:13.820
Keep breathing.

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:15.780
Keep breathing.

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:17.660
Take it slow.

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:18.780
Inhale.

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:21.980
Inhale.

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:23.820
Slower.

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:51.260
It's okay now.

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:56.100
It's alright.

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:56.700
Thanks.

00:26:57.780 --> 00:26:58.580
Thank you.

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:04.100
Why did you come out too?

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:06.500
This isn't your first time here.

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:08.980
Why haven't you learned?

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:14.500
I

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:17.340
thought

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:20.020
I saw my dad, so...

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:28.500
I'm fine now.

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:37.780
Why did you come out too?

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:45.500
Couldn't sleep.

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:52.580
You're about to get married.

00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:55.820
You shouldn't be running around
like this.

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:01.780
It's been canceled.

00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:06.700
What?

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:12.100
I didn't want to lie to her,

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:14.340
or to myself.

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:22.180
Don't worry.

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:24.500
It's not because of you.

00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:03.780
Thanks.

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:07.020
Sorry about today.

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:09.340
I shouldn't have taken it out
on you guys.

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:10.500
It's fine.

00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:12.020
It was Rookie's fault.

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:13.180
He wasn't careful with his work.

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:16.740
Bugs are normal.

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:17.780
It's not something Rookie and the others

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:18.540
can fully control.

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:21.180
Just tell me,

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:23.180
did things go south with Ms. Tan?

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:25.940
Don't play dumb with me.

00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:27.100
Others might not know you,

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:28.260
but I know you too well.

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:33.340
There's no way she could ever like me.

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:35.260
Because she

00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:37.020
already has someone else in her heart.

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:42.460
It's okay.

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:44.100
You'll meet someone better.

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:45.020
Look at me.

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:46.180
I dated over a dozen girls

00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:47.540
before I met my wife.

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:48.700
You need to distract yourself.

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:52.500
Then I'll focus all my attention

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:54.180
on you guys.

00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:57.100
Fine. Then you can
boss me around every day.

00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:58.260
You can even yell at me.

00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:01.100
This drink isn't strong enough.

00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:02.020
I'll go get a different bottle.

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:10.060
Here's your ticket.

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:19.340
One ticket to Hongyuan

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:19.980
for 1 PM.

00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:20.500
Please hurry.

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:22.500
Okay.

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:23.020
Here you go.

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:23.740
Thanks.

00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:31.020
After we hung up,

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:32.740
I asked a few of my friends.

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:34.860
But no one has gotten back to me yet.

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:36.420
The place we're going to

00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:37.980
is a bit remote.

00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:40.260
I don't want to give up any chance.

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:42.460
Okay.

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:42.900
Thank you.

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:43.780
No problem.

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:45.980
Keep looking.

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:46.540
Right.

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:01.460
This is the place.

00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:05.580
Haji.

00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:06.780
Hello.

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:10.340
Long time no see.

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:12.020
Yes. It's been ages.

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:14.740
This is my good friend, Haji.

00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:16.860
He knows this area very well.

00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:18.340
And he knows a lot of people.

00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:19.940
He just isn't very good at Mandarin.

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:22.220
Hello.

00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:25.780
Right here.

00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:27.460
He forgot.

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:29.580
That, right here.

00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:32.100
I remember.

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:34.940
A week ago,

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:37.020
he came to my place.

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:38.260
We herded sheep,

00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:39.260
ate,

00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:40.260
and lived together.

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:43.540
After moving some goods,
he went somewhere else.

00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:46.500
He said it was Mr. Tan.

00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:47.740
He stayed here for about a week.

00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:48.540
He ate,

00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:50.500
herded with them.

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:52.020
Lived just like us Tibetans.

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:52.980
He also did some driving

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:54.340
and transport work.

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:55.500
But

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:57.220
he left here a week ago.

00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:57.980
Said he was gone.

00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:00.420
Then does he know where my dad went?

00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:02.300
Where did he go?

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:05.100
He didn't say where he was going
when he left.

00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:06.500
So I don't know.

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:08.500
He didn't say where he was going
when he left.

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:09.340
He left secretly.

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:10.540
So he doesn't know.

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:11.740
Did he

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:13.260
mention before

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:15.020
where he might go?

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:17.780
Do you know where he might have gone?

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:19.340
It seemed like he had some business.

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:22.580
Something from before.

00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:24.460
He didn't say, so I don't know.

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:26.500
He said he didn't say.

00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:28.500
Said Mr. Tan usually doesn't talk much.

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:30.340
He didn't talk about the past.

00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:32.100
Seems like a man with a lot of stories.

00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:34.220
Well,

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:37.100
is there any other way to find a clue?

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:40.220
Is there any other way to find a clue?

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:45.340
Should I make a phone call?

00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:46.860
That's the only way.

00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:48.020
He said he'll make a call to confirm

00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:48.780
and ask more carefully.

00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:49.500
Okay.

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:50.340
Wait a moment.

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:50.740
Right away.

00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:57.260
Let's wait a bit.
