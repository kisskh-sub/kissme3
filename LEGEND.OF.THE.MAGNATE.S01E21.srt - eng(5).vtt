[Legend of the Magnate]

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.990
[Episode 21]

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.350
You, come here.

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:56.960
Come here. Come here.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.660
Look what I've got for you.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.580
Take it.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:03.390
This is for me?

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.240
Yes, for you.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.860
Take it.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.000
A little gift for you.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:20.870
Thanks a lot.

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:25.360
Weapons

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:26.960
ready!

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.920
Salute!

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.150
One!

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.240
Two!

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.360
Weapons

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.320
back!

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.930
Nice!

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.190
Nice. Excellent.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.340
Excellent!

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:46.079
Nice.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.590
Nice.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.980
If you like it, come again!

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.960
Sure.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.710
Are we sleeping in the cave tonight?

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.190
We can't sleep in a cave
at this kind of time.

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.790
The yin energy is too strong.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.079
You keep watch
for the first half of the night,

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:50.740
and I'll take the second half.

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:52.079
Just bear with it.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.060
Things will get better
once we reach the horse camp.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.920
Aren't we going back to Ningguta?

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.230
Why are we going to the horse camp again?

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.190
There's still a treasure
in that horse camp.

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.360
Once we sell this cartload of
foreign weapons,

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.890
what treasure can't we buy?

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.710
My treasure can't be bought with money.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.590
Here.

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.870
Take it.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.870
Tell me.

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.310
After we hand over these guns,

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.390
what kind of official position
do you think they'll give me?

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:35.320
If you're lucky,

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.850
they might reward you with
a general's rank.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.720
How long have you been taking this stuff?

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.430
This is taboo for officials.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.480
Everyone in the official circle

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.090
is secretly taking this stuff.

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.460
I'll quit it once my cough is gone.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.970
I'm going to be a general, you know?

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.040
A great general,

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.000
mighty and imposing.

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.690
Let's find a place sheltered from the wind
to hide for a bit!

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:40.830
We can't hide!

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.390
If the horses freeze to death,

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:45.360
we'll never make it back!

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.270
Just keep moving—

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.920
we'll reach the horse camp before dark!

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:04.280
There's still one more mountain to cross!

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.460
Stop neighing!

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.800
Are you trying to call the wolves over
or something?

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:10.110
I've fought with them for years.

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:12.390
They'd gather in packs trying to eat me,

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.160
but didn't they end up as meat in my mouth

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.820
and bedding for me to sleep on?

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:17.870
We're leaving tomorrow.

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.270
Let's bid them farewell.

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:32.970
Look how cowardly you are.

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:34.430
Come on.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.310
Go get some rest.

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.070
I'll tie up the horses

00:07:39.159 --> 00:07:40.620
and give them some fodder.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:42.360
Bolt the door properly—

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.960
don't let the wolves get you.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.000
There's wine in the pot.
Feel free to drink.

00:07:47.159 --> 00:07:48.890
We can't take it with us anyway.

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:51.930
What are you doing?

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.570
Do you know how to use a gun, boy?

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.060
If they smell the scent of blood,

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:25.720
they'll love it.

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:35.150
You stole my bullets!

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.010
Are you out of your mind?

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.200
You planned to die all along!

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:44.720
So why did you take me on

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.380
such a long detour to get here?

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:49.630
I want you to taste

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:51.630
what I've been through—

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.560
falling headfirst

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.000
from the clouds.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:03.480
Fine.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.790
Now things are just the way you wanted.

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:08.200
Go on then. Shoot me.

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:09.480
Shoot me!

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.390
In another 100 days,

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.130
or even 200 days,

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:23.360
no one will ever come here.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.200
The wolves will drag you away,

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.390
leaving only a pool of blood
on the ground.

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:28.630
When it heats up

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:30.730
and after a few rainfalls,

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:33.000
it'll be washed clean—

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:35.720
like you were never here at all.

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:39.970
I know you're out of opium.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.550
Come back to the Central Plains with me.

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:45.210
I'll find you the best doctor.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:45.810
And also,

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.630
that cartload of guns,

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:49.240
I won't take a single penny
from selling them.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.100
It's all yours.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.240
My illness can't be cured!

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.340
I've told you it can't be cured!

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.870
I've been clinging to life with this opium

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:58.190
just to wait for you.

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:00.670
You've ruined my life!

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:01.720
My illness

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.550
first developed here from the cold!

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:04.820
Everything I ever had

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:06.300
has been ruined by you!

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.510
Look carefully.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.400
This is the Ice Hell,

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:12.860
and I'm the King of Hell!

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.310
Get up, come on.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:10.750
Go away!

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:11.820
Go away!

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:30.910
Here.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.530
Are there any bullets left?

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.490
No, none left.

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:44.500
How do I check?

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:51.530
There's only one left.

00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:00.110
The wolves are banging on the door again.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:04.000
It won't be long
before they break it down.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.130
The two of us

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:09.670
are going to die sooner or later—

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:12.310
that's all there is to it.

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.960
Open this for me.

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.480
So this is your treasure?

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:36.120
My treasure is gone.

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:41.160
When that girl surnamed Su

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.870
came last time,

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:46.930
I was on the brink of death.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.580
She left two crates of this treasure,

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:53.910
so I could stay alive and wait for you.

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:56.070
Isn't she just like

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:59.160
a living Bodhisattva
who can predict everything?

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.240
Su Zixuan!

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.160
If I were you,

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.850
I'd use this thing

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.790
to put a bullet in my own head.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.720
Being torn apart by wolves hurts a lot.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.060
Judging by the direction,

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.290
they should be near the horse camp.

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:10.910
Yu'er,

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:12.060
don't rush.

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:13.480
The wind is strong and the snow is heavy.

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:15.480
Let's find a local to guide us there.

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:17.960
Isn't there a path right in front of us?

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:18.480
Yu'er!

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:02.680
Yu'er!

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:09.880
Yu'er.

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:11.200
Yu'er.

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:43.240
Mr. Chang.

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:43.910
My friend.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.130
We traveled day and night here.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.130
Thank heavens

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.400
that you're safe and unharmed.

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:26.790
What does the Empress Dowager look like?

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:30.490
Just a nose and two eyes—

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:32.010
like any normal person.

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:33.270
I don't believe you.

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:34.070
You're lying.

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:35.110
I'm not.

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:36.550
When I met her,

00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:39.150
I didn't even know
she was the Empress Dowager.

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:42.380
She's not as pretty as you.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.410
What about Yimei?

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.200
Who of us is prettier?

00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:57.310
I'm sorry, Gu.

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:00.030
I couldn't help but ask.

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:02.710
It's okay.

00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:04.960
Whether she's pretty or not

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.360
has nothing to do with me.

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:08.850
She chose her own path.

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.200
But sometimes when I think about it,

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.600
I'm quite envious of her.

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:13.790
Why?

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:16.170
She believed that path was right,

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:17.230
so she just took it.

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:18.790
In life,

00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:22.000
if you never go a little wild,
you're letting yourself down.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:22.820
Gu,

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:25.620
that's something
only a true hero would say.

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:26.960
I've been messed up like this—

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.820
how could I still be called a hero?

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:31.130
What about you?

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:34.880
Still traveling with the horse caravan
alongside Mr. Chang?

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.360
I didn't expect that
upon arriving in the capital,

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:38.090
I'd hear that you're also here.

00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:41.100
Li Qin asked me to tell you

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:43.330
not to go to the capital,

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:46.120
saying people there
wouldn't treat you well.

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:47.480
If I don't go to the capital,

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.810
who am I supposed to
sell all these guns to?

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:50.480
In this world,

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:52.080
aside from you and Mr. Chang,

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.400
hardly anyone truly cares about me.

00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:06.200
After you left,

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:08.590
we made two more trips to Horqin.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.880
When leaving the city, I was
thinking about

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:15.000
how you'd walked that road before.

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.000
When I got to the grasslands,

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.380
I thought again of

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:21.860
the time when we were fighting

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:23.880
and got surrounded by cavalry.

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:24.790
You said...

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:30.010
You said you never imagined

00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:30.750
that the two of us

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:32.150
would end up dying there.

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:35.170
If we had died then,

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:39.690
wouldn't that have actually been
a blessing?

00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:55.230
Up ahead is Ningguta.

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:57.960
Shall we revisit our old haunt?

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:01.200
Who's revisiting old haunts with you?

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:02.830
Once we enter the city,

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:04.070
we'll swap for two new horses,

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:06.200
buy some food, and continue on our way.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.590
What were you two talking about?

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:10.360
Why are you crying like a bunny?

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:13.110
It's too late to wipe your tears.

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:15.240
I'm hungry.

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:16.230
I'll go ahead.

00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:39.790
Mr. Gu.

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:41.060
Yu'er and I

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:43.010
won't be going to the capital.

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:45.880
This road leads straight into Shanxi—

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:48.040
it's very fast and convenient.

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:49.880
Mr. Chang, have you forgotten?

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:51.680
I've traveled this way with you before.

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:53.280
That's right. That's right.

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.880
All good things must come to an end.

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:01.400
Let's part ways here.

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:02.480
Mr. Chang.

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.260
What is this about?

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:11.350
Get up! Get up! I cannot accept this.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:12.750
Listen to me.

00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:14.950
You came from afar to save me—

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:16.720
such noble kindness

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:18.570
cannot be repaid

00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:21.640
with a mere "thank you."

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:22.720
Get up now. Get up.

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:23.780
Come on, get up!

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:27.140
You're a good person in every way,

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:29.150
but occasionally

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:29.920
when you say those refined things,

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:31.300
I really can't take it.

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.590
My daughter and I
have benefited from your kindness,

00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:35.720
and this time, we've just repaid
a little of it.

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:36.440
Actually, we're the ones

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:37.970
who should be thanking you.

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:41.910
All right.

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:47.750
Young fellows grow old
in this world of strife—

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:49.680
who knows when we'll meet again?

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.030
Father.

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:56.240
You've picked up quite a few of

00:26:56.270 --> 00:26:58.070
these pretentious phrases too.

00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:00.390
After knowing Mr. Gu for so long,

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.860
isn't it only natural that
I picked up a thing or two?

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.640
You two say your goodbyes properly.

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:07.100
I'll wait for you up ahead.

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:38.960
Yu'er.

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:45.750
I'll be thinking of you all the time.

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:50.510
You...

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:53.550
Don't make me cry,

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:55.810
or Father will just laugh at me later.

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:08.080
How about

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.170
I escort you back to Shanxi?

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:16.880
Forget it.

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:19.200
Even if

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:21.750
we get to Shanxi,

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:24.010
you're still going to leave, aren't you?

00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:27.030
I don't want to live
this kind of life anymore,

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:29.030
always begging the sun and the moon.

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.900
What do you mean,
"begging the sun and the moon?"

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:39.400
I...

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:44.640
I beg the sun to set later,

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:48.640
so I can stay with you longer.

00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:51.790
I beg

00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:54.660
the moon to rise earlier,

00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:55.550
and I wish this road

00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:56.880
would never end.

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:01.480
But doesn't every road in this world

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.240
eventually come to an end?

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:05.300
And when it does...

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.050
It means we have to part.

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.480
Even if we go to Shanxi together,

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:12.080
it's not the end of the world.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:20.480
Yu'er.

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:26.750
I know I owe you a lot.

00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:29.030
I'm sorry.

00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:34.240
What's there to apologize for?

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.040
O-On our way here,

00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:38.330
my father secretly came to me and said

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:39.750
someone like you,
who could venture deep into foreign lands

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:40.920
to buy weapons for the imperial court

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:42.240
and still escape death,

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:43.070
must be a person

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:44.880
blessed with great fortune,

00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:46.560
with unlimited potential.

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:47.480
I...

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:49.150
I agree with that.

00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:51.520
In the future...

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:53.800
In the future,

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:56.250
if you become a governor

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:57.850
or a general someday,

00:29:58.440 --> 00:29:59.370
there will be...

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:02.620
There will be many more people
who will like you.

00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:10.330
You can't possibly apologize to me
every day then, can you?

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:14.210
You're really something.

00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:15.510
What governor or general?

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:17.370
I've never imagined such things.

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:18.600
Stop making fun of me.

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:27.170
Things between men and women
in this world are always like this.

00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:30.370
Once we enter this world,

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:32.610
we're destined for a hard life.

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:37.000
If I could have a love
to be remembered for a lifetime,

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.860
that would already be a blessing.

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.160
If I still don't know contentment,

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:43.400
even Heaven would blame me

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:45.330
for being unappreciative, right?

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:47.480
Gu,

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:56.880
please live well.

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:00.040
Do...

00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:04.730
Do things that make you happy.

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:06.640
That's my greatest wish.

00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:43.050
I want to tell you

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:49.360
that when life finally
settles down someday,

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:52.500
I want to come find you.

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.140
But I'm afraid that day

00:31:58.350 --> 00:32:00.350
might keep you waiting for too long.

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:50.400
Well...

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:54.330
Just like what my father just said,

00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:57.160
"young fellows grow old
in this world of strife."

00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:58.620
If you want to come find me,

00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:00.150
then hurry.

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:41.590
By His Highness's command,

00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:43.720
please bring Mr. Gu in for an audience.

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:46.850
Mr. Gu.

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:48.570
The entire capital
has been searching for you,

00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:50.280
[Prince Gong's Mansion]

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:52.070
making me worried sick.

00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:52.790
Come on,

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.000
pay your respects to His Highness.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.790
Even for distinguished guests,

00:33:55.790 --> 00:33:56.680
His Highness has never

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:58.480
come to the gate to welcome them.

00:33:59.110 --> 00:33:59.970
Your Highness.

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:01.110
Please rise.

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:04.920
You're not an official,

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:07.190
so let's treat each other as equals.

00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:10.000
I heard about it
as soon as you entered the city.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.280
So, this cart is loaded with foreign guns?

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:13.610
Indeed, Your Highness.

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:15.110
Let me see.

00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:18.440
[Prince Gong's Mansion]

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:19.670
Mr. Gu.

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:22.150
You've had a long and tiring journey.

00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:22.920
Thank you for your efforts.

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:23.710
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:24.710
It was no trouble.

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:48.760
Nice stuff.

00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:50.860
Here.

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.250
Mr. Gu.

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:55.960
I truly never expected

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.440
that you'd be able to
travel such a great distance

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:59.540
to purchase these guns
from the foreigners.

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:00.020
This...

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:02.850
How can I ever repay this favor?

00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:04.680
Mr. Qiao,

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:06.150
please don't say such things.

00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:07.360
If you could truly help our country

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:08.400
reclaim lost territory,

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:09.280
all the common people

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:11.280
would be eternally grateful to you.

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:14.480
Come here.

00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:15.190
Mr. Gu.

00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:15.550
Stamp this batch of guns

00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:17.150
with the imperial court's wax seal

00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:18.770
and first send them to
the Northwest Military Supply Station.

00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:20.150
-Have our men keep a close watch.
-Mr. Gu.

00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:21.880
Don't let anyone take them away.

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:22.920
The Empress Dowager

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:24.030
has praised your insight

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:25.510
in front of me several times.

00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:26.660
Do me a favor—

00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:28.800
would you be willing to serve as

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:29.630
a Pacification Commissioner
for the imperial court?

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:30.490
Your Highness.

00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:32.510
I've never been an official,

00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:33.790
nor do I know how to be one.

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:35.320
A Pacification Commissioner
isn't an official,

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:36.320
but a bridge between the imperial court

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.350
and the rebels.

00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:40.000
Once the war breaks out,
casualties are inevitable.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.320
Besides, not everyone in Hefei

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:42.670
is in collusion with the bandits.

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:43.760
We need someone to enter the city

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:45.390
and evacuate the civilians.

00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:46.630
This person should be

00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:47.880
a well‑known local figure—

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:50.070
a gentry trusted by both sides
would be ideal.

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:51.930
Besides, Anhui is your hometown.

00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:53.040
Mr. Gu,

00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:54.970
you're obligated to help.

00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:57.660
If you manage to accomplish this,

00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:58.800
I will personally

00:35:59.150 --> 00:36:00.950
grant you an official position.

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:02.090
How does that sound?

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:05.690
Since Your Highness has said that,

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.070
for the people of my hometown,

00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:07.930
I, Gu Pingyuan,

00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:10.590
will dedicate myself to it
even at the risk of my life.

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:11.320
It's just

00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:13.070
I have one humble request

00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:15.480
that I hope Your Highness will grant.

00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:16.150
Go ahead.

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:18.670
Years ago, my father came to the capital
for the imperial examination

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:19.880
and never returned.

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:21.760
He remains missing to this day.

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:23.400
Later, when I went to take
the imperial examination,

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.840
someone at the examination hall

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:26.710
falsely claimed my mother was gravely ill,

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:29.230
which made me cause a scene
at the examination hall

00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:31.400
and got exiled to Ningguta subsequently.

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:34.400
To this day, I still don't know
whether my father is alive or dead,

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:35.800
nor who has been scheming against me

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:37.130
from behind the scenes.

00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:39.330
I'm merely a commoner

00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:41.190
with no authority to investigate
such matters.

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:42.030
If Your Highness

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:43.230
could give the order,

00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:45.360
perhaps the truth could finally
come to light

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:47.960
and resolve the greatest confusion
of my life.

00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:52.280
As a filial son,

00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:55.510
causing a scene at the examination hall
for your ill mother

00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:56.960
is understandable.

00:36:58.070 --> 00:36:59.930
But your father's disappearance

00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:02.230
is indeed somewhat strange.

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:03.880
Here's what we do.

00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:05.640
Later tonight,

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:07.920
write a petition
and have it delivered to my residence.

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:09.070
I'll have
the Nine Gates Infantry Commander's men

00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:09.920
investigate for you.

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:11.050
If there's any news,

00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:13.150
I'll have them
send word to you immediately.

00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:14.280
How does that sound?

00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:16.610
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:25.480
The Hefei Garrison General,
Li Cheng, is really fierce.

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:27.190
Even though the situation
has become hopeless for him,

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:29.650
he's still putting up stubborn resistance.

00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:32.050
Let me show you something.

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:34.840
Do you know what this is?

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:39.190
This is...

00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:40.800
This is Hefei city.

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.480
Those two mountains outside the city

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:45.840
were taken by the Green Standard Army

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:46.710
at the cost of countless lives.

00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:47.480
I've already sent men

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:49.880
to transport the Western cannons
to the mountaintops.

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:50.590
If he still refuses to surrender,

00:37:50.590 --> 00:37:51.830
we'll fire from above

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:53.510
directly at his mansion.

00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:57.280
But if we keep fighting like that,

00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:58.070
won't all the civilians in the city

00:37:58.070 --> 00:37:59.070
be blown to death?

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:01.880
Mr. Gu, you truly have
a compassionate heart.

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:03.150
No one has ever cared about

00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:05.030
these civilians anyway.

00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:06.960
Mr. Gu, look.

00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:08.670
I've only encircled the city
on three sides,

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:10.030
leaving one side open.

00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:12.840
We've been digging tunnels under the city
for nearly half a year,

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:15.070
and we've secretly placed
30,000 catties of explosives

00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:16.400
beneath the city walls.

00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:18.280
Now that our forces
are strong and well-equipped,

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:21.010
we can guarantee victory
in one decisive battle.

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:24.400
Will Li Cheng and his men
be willing to retreat?

00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:27.900
He's a fierce general.

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:30.030
We've besieged them for so long

00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:32.070
that the citizens
have even started eating rats,

00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:33.510
yet they still stand firm

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:35.120
with undiminished morale.

00:38:36.110 --> 00:38:36.920
I wonder

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:39.070
what kind of dark magic he's been using.

00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:41.200
They've already started eating rats?

00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:44.840
Mercy has no place in commanding troops.

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:46.040
For someone like him,

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.110
even if 100,000 people

00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:49.480
died right before his eyes,

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:50.440
he wouldn't care.

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:52.070
He was just granted the title of prince—

00:38:52.070 --> 00:38:53.920
if he doesn't hold on to the city
for a few more days,

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:54.550
he'd be unworthy of

00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:56.680
the official's hat bestowed upon him.

00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:01.510
This is the number one rule
of being an official:

and delivered to the capital,
not a leaf less.

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:24.920
But most of it ended up in the palace.

how many people with money

the Orchid Snow tea seedlings from them.

even tea merchants
from Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Fujian

00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:09.870
Please get up.

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:14.620
You're even older than my mother.

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:17.100
I cannot possibly accept such a gesture.

00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:18.190
Everyone,

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:19.840
if you truly

00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:21.100
wish to follow my lead,

00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:23.190
then please listen to what I have to say.

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:24.790
Please, everyone be seated.

00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:25.870
Old Master Hu,

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:28.020
please take the seat of honor.

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:37.320
Bring it out.

00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:40.890
Don't play dumb.

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:51.110
Everyone,

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:54.730
I was arrogant and disrespectful in Anhui

00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:56.490
and offended Old Master Hu.

00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:58.510
Today, Old Master Hu

00:42:58.510 --> 00:42:59.800
wants to apologize to me,

00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:00.400
and I'd also like to apologize

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:01.700
to the entire

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:02.510
Anhui Tea Merchants' Association.
