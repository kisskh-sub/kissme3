Why are you hiding in the blanket?

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.780
Don't look.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.730
I said, no!

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.800
Did I make those marks?

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.850
If you get drenched on a rainy day...

Right. So, where are you going?

I'm taking my kid to Southeast Asia.

The first time was a mistake.

I told you...

The second time...

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.800
was because of my possessiveness.

-Okay.

Okay, time for lunch!

00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:52.630
Okay.

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:53.860
Hey, how about spicy pork?

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:55.200
I'm sick of spicy pork.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.480
Why?

-Ugh, I'm going crazy.

I'm not hungry.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.620
Still, Jeonghan,
you should join everyone for lunch.

Leave him alone.
What's wrong with wanting some alone time?

Let's go.

Fine, let's go.

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:37.010
How about cold noodles?

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:38.260
Sounds good.

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:35.780
Not your first time here?

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:37.060
Oh...

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:40.200
Yeah.

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:42.750
Eat.

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:44.030
Oh.

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:56.120
I have something to say.

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:01.170
If you're going to apologize,
do it after eating.

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:06.420
Jeonghan.

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:07.760
Yeah?

00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:12.930
I want to be in a relationship with you.

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:15.210
What?

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:20.060
I want to be
in a serious relationship with you.

00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:27.690
Hey.

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:29.730
Do you think it makes sense?

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:31.360
Why doesn't it make sense?

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:33.560
Do I have to explain such a simple thing?

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.100
Explain it to me.

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:42.460
Lee Iljo, we're cousins.

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:44.090
If that is important,

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:47.090
what about everything we've done?

00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:48.630
You hugged me, kissed me,
and smiled at me.

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:50.300
You always took the initiative.

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:52.680
So why can't we be official?

00:22:57.570 --> 00:22:58.890
Fine.

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:01.780
I was wrong.

00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:06.520
I was freaking thoughtless
and a total idiot.

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:07.760
Happy?

00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:15.390
What was I to you?

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:18.400
Whatever it was, it's meaningless.

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.530
Not that you ever meant anything to me.

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:25.270
It doesn't matter.

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:28.710
Hey.

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:33.530
Don't be clingy. It's a turn-off.

00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:37.360
You said it yourself
that you fall in love easily.

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:42.600
Don't try these love games with me.
Find someone else.

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.950
But you're the one I like.

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:50.070
Enough with this sappy crap and just eat.

00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:24.940
The biggest problem is

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:27.380
[User Survey and Analysis Result]

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:29.430
the data loss.

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:32.000
Automatic safekeeping becomes unstable,

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.720
which lowers the users' trust.

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:35.950
[Thank you for everything.]

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:37.070
So we should...

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:38.990
[I'll move out by this week.]

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:41.910
It's necessary to strengthen this feature.

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:46.090
Also, we need to improve on
our equipment for the AI program.

00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:47.360
A variety...

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:53.810
Jeonghan.

00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:55.770
How dare you inform me through text?

00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:57.480
And why aren't you picking up your phone?

00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:59.100
Are you taunting me?

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:01.140
I'm working.

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:04.350
Let me know the total cost of
the remaining hospital bill and the rent.

00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:06.720
Rent?

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.620
And food expenses.

00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:10.480
Lee Iljo.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:14.280
Did I ever ask you
to pay me for all that?

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:15.790
No.

00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:19.460
Then why are making me out to be so petty?

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:20.850
You have nowhere to go anyway.

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:23.390
I do.

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:25.590
My friend's place.

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:27.430
Your friend?

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:28.680
Which friend?

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:35.890
Him?

00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:38.900
So you've been living at his place?

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:40.250
Do you even know him?

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:41.470
He's a good person.

00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:44.440
For goodness sake.

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:47.060
That's your biggest problem.

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:48.520
You just met him,

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:53.370
but you're following him around
like a stupid puppy.

00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:56.010
Don't look at me with those eyes,
like I'm pathetic.

00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:58.160
How much are you paying him?

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:00.880
Oh.

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:02.610
Or are you

00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:05.800
going to pay him with your body again?

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:09.650
Do you just sleep with anyone,
even if you don't have feelings for them?

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:12.160
That's you.

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:14.060
What?

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:17.130
You don't like me,
but you screwed me as you liked.

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:23.240
You don't know when to stop talking,

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:24.630
do you?

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:37.240
Hash it out outside.

00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:50.710
What?

00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:57.090
Okay.

00:26:57.090 --> 00:26:59.160
I won't move out, so go now.

00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:02.740
I'll be home at eight.

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:04.140
Don't be late.

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:07.440
Get home before me and wait for me.

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.110
Why do you always do whatever you want?

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:12.710
Because I can do whatever I want with you.

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:16.910
Just because I like you, it doesn't mean
you can do whatever you want with me.

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:21.080
Jeonghan.

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:23.450
You don't know how I feel.

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:30.050
I'm not interested in
knowing how you feel.

00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:31.750
It's not important too.

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.630
You just have to do as I say,

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:37.560
understand?

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:39.860
You're really a freaking scumbag.

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:45.310
Hey! Lee Iljo!

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:48.220
Just you wait. Damn it.

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:37.590
Lee Iljo.

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:50.780
[In the next episode]

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:53.500
How did you know I was here?

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:55.180
Where else can you go?

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:56.420
When are you coming home?

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:57.760
I don't know.

00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:00.240
My dad said he wanted me to be happy.

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:03.460
But I don't know if I deserve to be happy.

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:05.930
You can be greedy.

00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:08.360
You deserve it.

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:10.240
You deserve happiness.

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:12.880
I know you're doing this
because you're bored,

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:14.440
but don't be too nice to him.

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:17.430
You're just toying with him as you wish.

00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:19.660
You're the worst.
