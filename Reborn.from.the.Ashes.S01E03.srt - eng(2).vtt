[Reborn from the Ashes]

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.440
[Episode 3]

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.790
The Su Family refused
to marry their daughter

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.670
to the sickly son
of the Prince's Mansion,

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.920
so,

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.590
they planned to have Zhijin marry

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.030
in her place.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:22.320
But now,

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.480
she is dead at my place.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.590
How can I explain this?

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.440
If I marry into the Wanyan Family

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.990
as the eldest daughter of the Su Family,

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.940
I can search in the mansion
for proof that my father was wronged.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.590
Madam Yun, don't worry so much.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.360
Zhijin has not seen the Su Family

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.030
for over ten years.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.070
How do you know all this?

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.230
Zhijin told me herself.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.590
No one from the Su Family
has seen Zhijin in ten years.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.150
So, who is Zhijin

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.320
is up to you.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.320
You're about the same age as Zhijin.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.070
As for looks,

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.150
you do carry the grace
of a refined young lady.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.280
Why don't you

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.030
take Zhijin's place

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.630
and return to the Su Family?

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.030
This is extremely risky.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.490
If caught, it could cost me my life.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.070
I haven't lived long enough yet.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.920
I dare not.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.590
What?

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.840
Don't you want to marry
into Prince Zhenbei's Mansion

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.590
to enjoy wealth and honor?

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.880
Listen to you,

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.760
who wouldn't want wealth and honor

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.030
and have a life of luxury?

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.760
Then go ahead.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.440
As long as I keep silent,

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.030
the Su Family won't find out.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:52.710
From then on,

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.280
you will become a person above others.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.280
You know far too much.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.150
If you don't go today,

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.030
then death is your only option.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.280
Then,

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.630
I'll give it a try.

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.360
Don't forget who helped you
along the way.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.280
Madam Yun, please rest assured.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.510
If I truly marry
into the Prince's Mansion,

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.320
I will share wealth and honor with you.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.360
You do have a conscience.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.710
Zhijin,

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.800
I will

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.360
reclaim everything for you.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.070
Wanyan family,

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.840
it's time for you to repay
what you owe me.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.070
My Lord,

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:50.990
the bait has taken the hook.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.840
I'm being watched here.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.230
What did the Master say?

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.800
When will the items be moved?

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.190
The Master has given orders:

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.590
do not act rashly.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.670
I'm just a simple woman.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.550
I can't bear such a shock.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:08.630
Hmph.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.070
Go back and tell the Master.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.280
That will cost extra.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.500
Additional payment is required.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.760
Take them down.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.590
Speak.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.290
Where are they hidden?

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.400
I...

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.880
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.590
Who was behind that deadly agent?

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.070
Deadly agent?

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.070
In our line of work,

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.670
we never ask guests' names.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.510
Very well.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.230
I'd like to see
whether it's your stubborn mouth

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.110
or my tough methods that prevail.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.920
Don't be so rough.

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.320
What if you accidentally kill her?

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:02.440
How about

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:04.590
we play a game?

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.550
Everyone makes a cut on her.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.150
Let's see how long she can endure.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:17.590
Sir...

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.360
No, please.

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.920
This man is truly ruthless.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.760
Begin.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.070
Take this.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:47.630
Sir...

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:48.840
No.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:08.380
You go ahead.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.150
No.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.590
Sir,

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.450
aren't you afraid of divine retribution

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.110
for forcing a confession
through coercion?

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.280
Divine retribution?

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:35.480
Keep going.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:38.440
Your turn.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.320
You.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.230
This man is so unpredictable.

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:45.070
He wouldn't remember me, would he?

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:54.590
Qianyue.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.360
Qianyue, please save me.

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.920
Qianyue, help me.

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.550
Do you still want to return
to the Su Mansion?

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.880
You

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.550
should go accompany Zhijin.

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:49.280
Madam Yun.

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:50.510
Madam Yun.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.550
How could you kill her?

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.790
We haven't finished
the interrogation yet.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:57.670
It wasn't me.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:58.760
It wasn't me.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.840
How could I dare kill Madam Yun?

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.230
You killed her.

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:18.480
Sir, you're mistaken.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.760
How could I ever dare kill Madam Yun?

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:24.150
Didn't you say

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:25.550
that we should each

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:27.710
cut her once?

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:30.550
So many have already cut her before.

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.630
I only gave her one cut.

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:34.000
I am innocent.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:36.110
If you don't believe me,

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:39.190
then take my worthless life.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:48.110
Hmph, such a chance to avenge Zhijin.

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.000
How could I let it slip away?

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.670
He wanted to kill me.

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:09.360
You still don't believe me.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:11.670
I believe you.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.510
But since she's dead,

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:16.960
you can finish

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:18.390
what she hadn't finished saying.

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:21.520
What does he want me to say?
Could it be...

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.720
[One day ago]

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:39.920
Sir, I think I know

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.560
where the place you are looking for is.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:49.110
Lead the way.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.070
I'm not sure if what I saw earlier

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.000
is actually what they want.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:02.800
Whatever.

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:05.110
Just give it a try.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:23.720
If you're lying to me,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.030
you know what will happen.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:27.430
No.

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:29.270
This path is uncertain.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:30.720
And his mood swings wildly.

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:32.640
I can't risk my life here.

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:34.490
I need to find a way to escape.

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:39.430
Yes, sir.

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:57.960
Since you've already found
what you sought,

00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:00.190
I will take my leave.

Mr Lord,

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.790
although we found the firearms,

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:13.720
we failed to capture the ringleader.

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:15.030
What a pity.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.110
This is enough for now.
