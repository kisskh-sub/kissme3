00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.800
What did you mean?

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.520
Why did you say luck wasn't on my side?

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.520
My friend is a fortune teller, and he never tells me that.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.160
If you don't believe me, check this out.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.800
See?

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.360
I just won the two-digit prize in the lottery.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.680
Are you seeing this?

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.760
Stop with the nonsense.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.280
Fine.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.960
What are you doing here?

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.160
Why should I tell you?

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.280
What?

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.160
We'll meet again

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.000
- Why? - because...

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.360
Are you going to alter my destiny?

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.320
Or are you here to get rid of me?

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.360
What's up with him?

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.360
You think you can just come and go?

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.040
I won the lottery.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.600
How would I have bad luck?

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.960
Phloeng?

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.960
What's wrong?

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.320
Do you think staying close to me will keep you safe?

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.600
I'll get rid of everyone myself.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.520
What are you going to do to me?

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.240
Huh?

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.800
What did I do, Master?

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.400
I think...

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.720
We should enter the building.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.800
Whoa.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.360
Coming to the building together like this...

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.920
Is there something going on?

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.920
It's not like what it seems, Ple.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.640
Oh?

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.920
I didn't say anything.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.520
Eh?

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.160
You're looking suspicious.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.280
What is it between you two?

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.200
What the hell are you saying?

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.880
Don't get flustered, you two.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.760
Are you good?

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.760
Yeah, I am.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.400
It's just that there's something on my mind.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.440
What is it?

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.200
A one-night stand?

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.480
No, not that.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.280
I stayed over 'cause I was scared of ghosts.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.760
You had a one-night stand?

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:54.680
With who?

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.800
Is he hot?

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.000
Tong, keep it down.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.240
No wonder you didn't text me at all.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.760
I...

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.320
Just say you had a one-night stand with Phloeng.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.440
We're friends here.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.240
Namo,

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.520
you bastard.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.640
Uh...

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.520
Is he good with the moves?

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.120
Gosh!

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.200
I said we didn't have a one-night stand.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.760
Come on.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.120
MP Eung will be disappointed in you.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.960
You're useless.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.440
He is so demanding, isn't he?

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.560
Uh...

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.440
Master and the team, you may enter the meeting now.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:33.800
- Okay, sure. - Okay.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.760
- Right this way. - Okay.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.040
A one-night stand, was it?

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.760
Everybody is here, right?

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.360
Whoa, Master...

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.360
You look so fresh and happy today.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.320
Master got the good stuff last night.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.600
Namo!

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.600
The reason for today's meeting

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.440
is to discuss a special project

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.240
that many of you

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.360
may already be familiar with.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.280
This meeting is intended to keep you up to date, Master.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.440
What's the project?

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.480
Next week, we're shooting a show outside the city.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.920
The show's called 'Spooky Hellish Night on the Rocks.'

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.280
It's an outdoor show about ghost stories

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.400
that airs quarterly as part of 'Spooky Hellish Night.'

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.200
This time, we're shooting outside the city.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.320
However, we don't know what province we'll be going to.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.360
And do I have to join you guys?

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.040
I thought we only recorded the show here.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.520
I really wish you could join us, Master.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.800
Your rating is going through the roof right now.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.680
Any videos about you

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.080
always pull millions of views.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.080
More importantly, our fans absolutely love it

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.280
when you're close to Phloeng.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.240
Don't worry about the expenses.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.720
We'll support you financially.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.520
As a cherry on top, you'll get paid extra.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.480
It's worth the effort, Master.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.040
Don't you agree, Tul?

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.360
That's correct.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.000
Please tell us how much you're requesting.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.320
But...

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.920
Maybe he's scared.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.520
I'm not.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.720
If you aren't, then don't hesitate.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.200
I'm not hesitating.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.000
It's obvious that you are.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.040
Well, I said I'm not.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.800
That means you're joining us, correct?

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.080
I am.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.960
Okay.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.440
Please resume the meeting.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.080
He's finally given in.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.600
It's settled, then.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.080
Can I use the toilet for a minute?

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.520
Namo.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.120
Come and take my spot.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.120
- Where are you going? - The toilet.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.040
You may continue.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:52.960
Alright.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.680
It's probably nothing.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.160
Are you okay, Master?

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.280
If you don't want to go, tell me.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:21.960
Right.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.480
I'm good.

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.240
Right...

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.240
I don't want you to feel uncomfortable.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.440
I've got nothing against this.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.360
I'm up for the project.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:35.600
That's great to hear.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.040
If you feel a bit tired,

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.720
feel free to join the meeting later.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:41.600
Right.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.080
Tul...

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:55.240
Yes?

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.920
Your end is near, old hag.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.520
I'll put you out of your misery.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:04.680
What's going on, Master?

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.760
I think something bad has happened.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.560
I think it's this way.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:17.520
Right.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.680
Currently, we're searching for a province

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.720
and a location with stories to film.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.240
If you have a place in mind or would like to suggest one,

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:28.000
feel free to reach out to me.

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:32.680
Huh?

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.600
Were you draining the ocean or what?

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.440
Where's Win?

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:37.680
I don't know.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.120
I saw him go out with Tul.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.920
Win's still not back?

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.920
I'll go and look for him.

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.600
Tong said that

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.520
he's with Tul.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:53.920
- Right? - Mm.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.080
Then I guess I'm staying here.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.640
I think...

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.200
It's this room.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:17.760
Let's go.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:34.760
- Auntie! - Auntie!!

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:38.640
Auntie...

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.080
- Auntie... - Auntie!

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:42.800
Master, wait here.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.240
I'll call an ambulance.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:47.880
Auntie!

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:49.880
Auntie...

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:11.880
Master?!

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.000
Master!

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.920
I never thought the security guard would do such a thing.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:30.760
It was me.

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.200
- A few days ago, - Correct.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.960
- he looked weird. - It's Tulatorn.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.240
Perhaps it's because of my bad luck year.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.680
Maybe her time was due.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.040
I have to go now.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:46.640
Wait.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:47.680
Where are you going?

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:49.760
To prepare for a funeral.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:51.600
Yesterday, it was Chakart.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.000
Today, it's the housekeeper.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.400
There's no place to cremate bodies at this rate.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:57.880
Are you coming home with me?

00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.280
I'm good.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:00.920
Thanks.

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.120
I just don't want anything bad to happen to you.

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.000
Are you okay?

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.960
I don't want any of you to be in trouble.

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:13.560
It's okay.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.560
I'll be fine.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.160
I'll catch you guys later.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:18.720
- Be seeing you. - See you.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.520
Win Wongsawat.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.080
Yes.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:23.440
Yeah.

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.360
My name is Tulatorn.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.000
And my name is Phloengnathitorn.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.200
Please tell Tul that I'm sorry.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:34.920
Will do.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.200
See you.

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:49.880
Sure.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:50.920
I'm more than happy to.

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:01.560
Tong.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.280
Where's Win?

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:05.840
He's gone home.

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.320
Tul.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.640
Just let him go home alone.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.520
He's been through a lot.

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:26.600
Okay.

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.160
Why are you following me?

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.040
You're imagining it.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.360
I'm on my way to get some stuff.

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:56.440
Right.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:59.240
By the way, where are you going, Master?

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:00.160
Want me to give you a ride?

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:02.800
I'm good.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:03.840
I think...

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.360
I want to be alone for a while.

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.680
Oh, Venerable Father!

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.600
Haven't you recalled

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:19.240
I told you not to travel out of the city?

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:22.760
It's only been two months since my birthday.

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.680
Are they really going to take my life?

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.040
You've dreamed about ghosts.

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.200
Do you think their intention is true or not?

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.000
They might not be ghosts.

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.760
Dreams are just a result of brain activity.

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.200
You've seen ghosts for your entire life,

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.000
yet you're using science as your excuse?

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:45.840
I simply want to say that...

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:48.960
This trip of yours... You will not make it back.

00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.560
Please don't say that, Venerable Father.

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.640
I don't want to die just yet.

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:04.640
If I decline this time, I'll surely face disapproval.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.920
I won't be able to make a living online for decades.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:09.760
That's up to you.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.960
Perhaps, it's your own karma.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:13.400
Aw...

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.760
Who would dare accept the offer if you say that?

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.320
Do you dare to decline such an offer?

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:19.760
Yes.

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.240
But, yeah...

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:23.360
You do know that

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.280
I hate going back on my promises.

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.120
Ouch! Venerable Father...

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:34.360
Alright.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.520
Whatever will be, will be.

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.440
We can't resist fate, can we?

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.040
By the way,

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.200
have you met the highly virtuous soul?

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.520
The highly virtuous soul

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:51.080
that you talked about?

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.440
I think I may have already met him.

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.120
It's Phloengnathitorn,

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:59.280
a man who possesses the Radiance of the Seven Gems.

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:01.000
Yeah, that's him.

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:04.240
Keep him close, understand?

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.240
What's wrong, Win?

00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:58.960
Let me rest a bit, Toh.

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.240
Hello, Waew?

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:20.240
How are things? Have you seen Chakart's ghost?

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.000
Watch your tongue, Waew.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.560
She must've been on her way to Uncle.

00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.800
He's the love of her life, you know?

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:28.480
Mm.

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:30.560
Also...

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.120
Namo is helping with her funeral.

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:34.880
Have you been doing well?

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:38.760
While living in the mountains, I've discovered a certain truth.

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:43.080
A local, an owner of a homestay, died right before my eyes.

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.160
So don't die, okay?

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.920
Take good care of yourself.

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.080
Wait until we meet again.

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.760
Right. I know.

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.600
I won't die that easily.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.320
By the way, can you go and find my book?

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:56.960
I've written something in it.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.200
I was told to give it to you after your birthday,

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.320
but I forgot.

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:14.000
Which one is it, Waew?

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.520
There are so many of them.

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.400
The normal-looking one.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.760
It's a book that compiles all sorts of incantations.

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.920
Maybe it's the purple one.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.280
On the second shelf.

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:53.640
Runes?

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:54.920
Incantations?

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:57.800
You perform this kind of stuff, too?

00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.400
Yeah, I studied them.

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:00.800
Give it a read.

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:02.760
A book of sorcery?

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:04.600
This is scary.

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:05.800
Scary how?

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:06.920
Just go through the pages first.

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.480
It took a lot for me to get to study it.

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.600
Right. I have to go now.

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.040
What's this, Win?

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:17.960
Why does it look so sketchy?

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:20.360
Agreed, Toh.

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:28.160
Hold this.

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:38.480
(Phloeng: Do you want to make merit tomorrow?)

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:46.600
At any rate,

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:48.800
keep him close, understand?

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:50.360
He'll be able to protect you.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:56.760
(Is it the work of destiny or fate?)

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:03.760
(I have no choice but to accept it)

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:12.520
(I've tried so hard, but it's impossible to run away)

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:18.760
(I have to accept that things are here to stay)

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:25.760
(I've always thought that love was just a ruse)

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:32.600
(I've never thought that my true love would be you)

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:41.000
(Love that everyone says it's marvelous)

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:45.960
First time?

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.080
You wanted to do this, didn't you?

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:52.920
Thank you for being here with me.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.040
Right.

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:59.440
Doesn't it feel hot being in a temple?

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.480
Are you saying that I'm a ghost?

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.120
Glad you know.

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:06.920
What?!

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.040
May the merit from this act

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:19.600
go to Yok.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:35.760
Hey!

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:37.320
That's the guard.

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:51.320
Mister?

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:55.520
Hey!

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:57.560
Don't come any closer.

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.760
Hey! Let me go!

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:10.320
You can't run away now.

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:11.560
I've called the police.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.360
Hey! Let go!

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:25.680
Hey! Hey! Hey!

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:44.600
Mister Guard...

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.320
What happened?

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:48.320
I don't know.

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:50.080
It felt like...

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:51.120
I fell asleep.

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:52.840
Fell asleep?

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:55.240
What about prior to this?

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.160
Have you seen anything unusual?

00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.360
Prior to this?

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:01.080
I didn't see anything.

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:04.920
But recently, I've noticed a lot of people coming to the office.

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:07.080
They'd come and wait for something.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:10.280
They looked dirty.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.960
Some of them even tried to climb the walls.

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.520
Phloeng's aura was immense,

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:18.440
yet why were they still trying?

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:24.320
Ah...

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:27.040
I'm...

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:27.920
I'm scared.

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:30.200
I... I...

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:32.080
I didn't kill Cleaner Nuan, did I?

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:33.800
Hey...

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:36.880
And...

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:38.560
Before this,

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:41.120
have you seen something else unusual near the office?

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:04.920
May I have great wealth. Sadhu.

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:19.360
Tong, Tong...

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:22.320
Need something?

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:23.360
Uh...

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.400
I'm here to deliver this document.

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:26.480
Oh.

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:27.800
Thank you.

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.480
So...

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:31.720
Is Win's project ongoing?

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:33.720
Oh, yes, it is.

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:34.480
Perfect.

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:36.560
I'm sure that this EP will also get a million views.

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:38.800
I sure hope so.

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:41.800
By the way...

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.760
Are you okay?

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.000
I am.

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:49.000
I've been getting into fights with my partner.

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:50.040
I see.

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:51.840
Best of luck to you.

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.520
I've got this for you.

00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:56.600
This sure can help.

00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:58.760
Your love life will be better.

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:00.760
You can return it to me if it doesn't work.

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:02.760
Thank you, Tong.

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:05.040
Good luck.

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:06.680
Tong.

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:09.400
For now...

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:11.040
I'll talk to you later.

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:12.000
Have a good day.

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:14.920
Is Master okay?

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:16.600
He's gotten better now.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:17.760
That's good.

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:19.960
Do you need something?

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:21.200
It's nothing.

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:22.640
It's...

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:25.760
What's the next step about Win?

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.240
Should I confess my love to him?

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:30.680
I think...

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:32.920
Now isn't the best time.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:36.280
Maybe wait until we are out of town.

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:37.960
Mm...

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:39.120
You're right.

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.000
Now might be too early.

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:43.200
Way too early.

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:47.320
Then...

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:50.760
What is it?

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.240
Please give this to Master.

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:56.680
Understood.

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.280
What? Tomorrow?

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:12.600
I forgot.

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.040
Do I need to bring anything?

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.200
No need.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.120
I've already taken care of everything myself.

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:18.160
Right.

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:26.000
Hey!

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.200
Toh!

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:44.000
Are you going to do this again?

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:46.800
Not anymore.

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:34.560
You...

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:36.520
What the hell are you doing?

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:38.840
Well...

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:41.320
I'm trying to learn something new.

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:45.200
It's for dealing with my karmic creditor.

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:48.080
Isn't this dark magic?

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.520
Runes.

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:51.440
Incantations.

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:52.720
Witches.

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:54.800
Witchcraft.

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:56.280
We'll see

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:58.520
if my karmic creditor

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.480
finds all of these ineffective.

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:14.360
What do you want me to do?

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:18.120
In the next 15 minutes,

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:20.360
if I drift away,

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:22.600
kick and send me flying, okay?

00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:25.480
You'll...be safe, right?

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.000
Mm.

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:28.520
Okay.

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:06.800
Brother...

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:08.400
Please help Win.

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:37.920
Is it working?

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.320
Let's try again.

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:17.960
Nothing happened.

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.280
What's wrong with Dad?

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:29.760
I don't know.

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:42.880
This is bad.

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:44.200
Ow!

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:46.360
Shit, my leg...

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:51.320
Win...

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:53.200
Win!

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:55.400
Ow...

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:56.760
Win.

00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:58.440
Win!

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:02.960
Win!

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:05.160
Ah.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.240
Ow.

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:21.680
Shit.

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:24.080
Are you alright?

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:27.080
I'm hurt.

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:36.560
That was horrifying.

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:38.520
What happened?

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.120
I think...

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:46.720
I've found my karmic creditor.

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:12.960
(With condolences, MP Eung and family)

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:21.200
If I were to die,

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:25.240
how long before my fans forget about me?

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:32.920
Come on, Wongsawat.

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.840
Has the dinner here made you lose your mind?

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:41.920
Come on.

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:43.360
Nobody's going to forget about you.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.080
Nowadays,

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:47.040
digital footprint is very apparent.

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:49.760
Your funny and goofy videos are all over the Internet.

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:51.360
By the time they forget about you,

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:53.400
all the plastic in the world will have broken down.

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:55.680
Mm.

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:57.880
Thank you, Namo.

00:32:58.360 --> 00:32:59.000
Mm.

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:00.760
That really helped me.

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:15.320
Hey.

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:16.520
Well...

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:18.320
I've got something to tell you.

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:19.840
- It's... - There.

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:22.840
One of your husbands is here.

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:25.720
Maybe he's attending the housekeeper's funeral.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.360
Cut it out, Namo.

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:35.560
Are you tired, Master?

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:38.960
I'm supposed to ask you the question.

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:45.960
Thank you,

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:47.680
for trying to save her.

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:49.560
Please don't thank me.

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:52.040
I couldn't save her in time.

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:53.600
Had we been quicker...

00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:55.320
It's okay, Master.

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:56.680
I think...

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.840
She's at peace now.

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:01.360
On top of that, the guard has been arrested.

00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:04.280
I think everything's starting to get better.

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:05.800
I guess.

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:09.280
I think death doesn't just mean

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:12.840
the body naturally breaking down,

00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:15.960
but also ceasing to be remembered by the living.

00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:17.640
It's at that point

00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:19.280
when the person is truly dead.

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:23.440
I think...

00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:26.200
You should bring this up on the show.

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:27.600
Huh?

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:29.200
A lot of people will subscribe to your idea.

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.240
Who exactly do you want me to tell this to?

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:33.920
It's knowledge for the common good.

00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:37.160
Right.

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:40.760
It's time for me to go.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.520
- I'll be seeing you. - Right.

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:50.800
Hey, young boy.

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:53.640
Can you check the toilet?

00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:54.760
The door can't be locked.

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:56.760
Please. It's this way.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.400
It's this one.

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:05.440
It's this stall, you see.

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:06.520
Please have a look.

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.600
I don't know why, but it can't be locked.

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:10.280
Sure thing, Uncle.

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:11.560
Thanks, young boy.

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:19.560
It works just fine, Uncle.

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:20.320
Mm...

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:21.520
Can you try it again?

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:23.680
Please, help me.

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:25.440
No problem.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.040
It works, Uncle.

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:33.800
Uncle?

00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:36.520
Uncle...

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:39.920
Uncle.

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:43.680
Shit!

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:45.280
I can't unlock the door.

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:49.160
Uncle.

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:51.160
Uncle!

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:52.920
Please unlock the door for me.

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:55.520
Hey, Uncle!

00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:58.640
Is anybody there?

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:01.800
Help, I'm stuck in the toilet stall.

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:06.000
You're in trouble now, Uncle.

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:19.120
Come on, pick up the phone, Namo.

00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:29.160
Anybody there?

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:31.240
Help me.

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:33.520
I'm stuck in the toilet stall.

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:41.720
Shit, this is bad.

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:44.200
The Uncle must've been one of the servants.

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.320
The real one is coming.

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:00.800
Phloeng?

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:17.960
Is this what you want, my karmic creditor?!

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:53.520
Why isn't he picking up?

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:12.720
Win, are you okay?

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:16.400
Hey, Win!

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:19.280
Win!

00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:20.520
What's wrong?

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:21.920
Win!

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:24.160
Wake up, Win!

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:27.520
Wayu.

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:33.960
Win.

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:38.000
Hello, Wayu.

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:41.280
Okay, understood.

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:49.160
Win!

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:50.960
Can you hear me?

00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:55.560
Venerable Father...

00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:57.800
Wait here.

00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:58.720
I'll be back.

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:00.840
Venerable Father!

00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:17.960
Please...

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:19.680
Please let me be yours.

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:23.160
Phloeng?

00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:54.320
Hey...

00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:02.760
Hatred...

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:04.840
ceases by smashing it to bits!

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.040
You have nothing left.

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:18.280
Ah!

00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:20.120
Let go!

00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:25.520
Go away!

00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:27.040
Ah!

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:28.520
Ow...

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:29.960
Let go of me!

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.200
Ah!

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:43.200
Allow me to lend you my aid.

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:50.840
If you encounter a ghost in disguise,

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:52.560
kick it in the groin.

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:54.280
Ow!

00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:55.840
I'm not scared of you, you foul ghost!

00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:57.040
Hey...

00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:00.760
Ow.

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:03.280
Wait!

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:06.000
Oh, shit.

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:08.280
Phloeng?

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:10.840
Master?

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:19.520
What was that for?

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:22.960
Are you the real one?

00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:24.920
Of course, I am.

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:26.880
Why did you slap me?

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:30.560
I'm sorry. I...

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:33.800
I thought you weren't the real one.

00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:35.720
You're making me really paranoid.

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:42.120
Wayu?

00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:43.800
Wayu? Who?

00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:46.280
Whoa.

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:50.720
You can also see him?

00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:52.960
See who?

00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:55.120
That guy.

00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:57.640
Of course, I can.

00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:00.560
How come?

00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:04.000
That's my younger brother.

00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:07.080
Huh?

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:10.080
He's my fraternal twin brother.

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:12.840
You have a twin?

00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:15.680
I didn't know you did.

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:17.040
Right.

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:18.840
My name is Wayu.

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:20.920
Master...

00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:24.080
You don't know?

00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:26.000
Wayu,

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:27.720
I'm so sorry

00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:29.080
that I...

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:31.040
I did that to you.

00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:32.920
No worries.

00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:35.400
But you got me good there.

00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:41.440
Right. I'll drive you home.

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:54.160
(Siam Nithrarom Co., Ltd)

00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:56.840
Win, my friend, I'm back!

00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:58.320
Win!

00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:01.040
You?

00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:01.680
And...

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:04.160
Where did Win go?

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:06.760
Too late.

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:08.240
There.

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:09.760
He's leaving with Phloeng.

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:11.440
Gosh.

00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:13.200
I got him so much stuff.

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:19.520
He's no longer possessed?

00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:24.560
Why didn't he tell me?

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:31.080
This took a while, you know?

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:35.080
Uncle,

00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:36.120
I'm returning these to you.

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:38.160
I've got no use for them now.

00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:40.080
Are you sure?

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:40.480
Yes.

00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:41.640
- Okay. - My friend is alright now.

00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:42.920
- Okay, okay. - Thank you.

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:44.360
- No problem. Alright. - Right.

00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:55.040
Hey, you.

00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:56.240
You're still here?

00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:58.720
I'm leaving soon.

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:01.680
Thank you so much

00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:02.760
for saving my friend today.

00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:04.680
Mm.

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:06.760
And...

00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:08.560
You're still here?

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:10.520
I'm sticking around.

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:12.720
I don't want to see a boy going home by himself.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:13.920
There are ghosts here.

00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:15.920
Come on, to my car.

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:17.760
Don't make excuses.

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:19.520
Why should I?

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:20.360
Huh?

00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:22.360
Are you trying to get me?

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:23.600
I've called a ride already.

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:24.440
It's arriving soon.

00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:27.000
There's something I need to talk to you.

00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:29.240
What is it?

00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:30.200
Can't we discuss it here?

00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:33.560
It's about your friend.

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:35.440
If you want to find out,

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:36.760
follow me.

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:09.080
Just admit you have a crush on me.

00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:10.520
Do I still have a chance?

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:12.080
I have no clue at this point.

00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:15.360
Tul sent this over to you.

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:17.400
This is absolutely horrifying.

00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:18.680
Tong is using dark magic.

00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:20.640
What about Job?

00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:22.440
He entered an abandoned house.

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:24.120
This is the message he sent:

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:25.040
"Help me."

00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:27.440
A murder occurred in this house.

00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:33.160
Depression,

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:33.920
anger,

00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:35.280
sorrow, and anguish...

00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:45.520
(Is it the work of destiny or fate?)

00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:52.560
(I have no choice but to accept it)

00:45:53.640 --> 00:46:01.320
(I've tried so hard, but it's impossible to run away)

00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:07.080
(I have to accept that things are here to stay)

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:14.120
(I've always thought that love was just a ruse)

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:21.400
(I've never thought that my true love would be you)
