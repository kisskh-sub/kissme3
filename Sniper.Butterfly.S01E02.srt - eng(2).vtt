00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.550
Secretary Cheng.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:20.510
Ms. Cen, sorry

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.550
for bothering you so early.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:22.740
It's like this.

00:02:22.977 --> 00:02:25.270
This morning, when I came over,
I found Li Wu at the door,

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.511
standing guard all night.
He said the lock was broken.

00:02:27.533 --> 00:02:29.700
I thought I'd let him
have a bite to eat before leaving.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.666
But after I came back from the canteen,

00:02:31.666 --> 00:02:32.900
I realized the kid was gone.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.510
I asked around and found out

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.270
his uncle had come

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.270
and taken him away.

00:02:36.333 --> 00:02:38.670
Saying he was going to take him
to work at the mine today.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.460
I guess by now,

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.620
he's already on the way.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:42.510
Wait for me a moment.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.070
(Chemistry)

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.420
Today you must go to the factory!

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.950
Go!

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:52.740
Go!

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.110
- Just let Wu go to school.
- Go!

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.555
All the money he earns goes to you!

00:02:56.555 --> 00:02:57.777
What do you want?

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.460
- Want to hit me, huh?
- Wu, let go! Wu!

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.300
Li Wu!

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:23.420
What did you say?

00:03:25.022 --> 00:03:26.180
I said I want to take Li Wu

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.180
to study in Yi City.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.460
Let him go to college.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:29.780
Why?

00:03:29.911 --> 00:03:31.600
You just take him away as you like?

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:32.840
How much?

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.500
You tell me.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:36.460
Is this about money?

00:03:37.488 --> 00:03:38.820
You've been talking about money

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:39.900
all along, haven't you?

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.500
Education to you

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:43.660
is worthless.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.500
But for Li Wu,

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.140
it's the only

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.380
chance to change his fate.

00:03:48.933 --> 00:03:49.820
He's a good student

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:50.660
my father cultivated.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.220
I can't let him be ruined.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.955
What do you mean by ruined?

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:56.820
If I hadn't taken him in,

00:03:56.844 --> 00:03:58.155
he would have starved to death.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.780
You city folks

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:00.955
have this kind of attitude.

00:04:00.977 --> 00:04:02.180
You think having money

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.577
lets you come to my house

00:04:03.777 --> 00:04:04.980
and take someone away?

00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:06.860
What are you doing? Get lost!

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:08.700
It's nothing.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:09.700
Move aside.

00:04:14.111 --> 00:04:15.622
If I really wanted to take him,

00:04:15.622 --> 00:04:16.970
I wouldn't be here talking with you.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.500
I've already contacted a lawyer

00:04:18.844 --> 00:04:20.533
who will go through
the previous contracts

00:04:20.533 --> 00:04:21.466
and clarify everything.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:22.860
I'm taking the rest of the money

00:04:22.977 --> 00:04:24.100
from the bank card as well.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.620
Wait...

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.100
The lawyer will also discuss with you

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.540
how much you've illegally taken

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.620
of assets that aren't yours.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.660
Forcing a child to drop out,

00:04:31.777 --> 00:04:33.420
depriving a natural person's legal will,

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:34.460
violates the law.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:35.820
If necessary,

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.020
the police

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.860
can be involved.

00:04:38.622 --> 00:04:39.900
You're trying to scare me?

00:04:40.355 --> 00:04:42.020
I don't know what you plan to do to me.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.860
30,000 yuan.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.380
I'll give it to you in one go

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:47.980
as this year's support money.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.780
I won't pursue the money
from the card anymore.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.700
30,000 yuan is definitely not enough.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.020
I need 50,000 yuan

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.060
to renovate a house.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.380
Why are you using your phone?

00:05:09.088 --> 00:05:10.580
Looking for a lawyer or the police.

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:11.620
Pick one.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.180
Alright, fine.

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:22.580
30,000 yuan is fine.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:23.940
As you say.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.220
Give me the card number.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.060
Secretary Cheng,

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.644
please call the village officials

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:31.500
to witness this.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:33.820
Li Wu,

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:34.660
go pack your things.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:39.900
Take out my bank card.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.660
(Chemistry, Chinese, Physics)

00:06:19.044 --> 00:06:21.100
I haven't had a chance
to ask your opinion yet.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:23.900
I'm officially asking you now

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.900
to take you back to Yi City.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:27.740
Are you willing?

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.020
I will pay you back.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.340
Alright.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:38.900
Does it include interest?

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.060
How much?

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:49.540
I'm just joking.

00:06:51.288 --> 00:06:53.660
You can pay me back
with your college entrance exam results.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:07.060
Put your things down.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:17.340
Wu.

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:28.780
Hurry up and go.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.700
Once you leave, don't come back.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.060
Can I go to one more place?

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:00.580
Go ahead.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:01.420
I'll wait here.

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:04.820
Li Wu.

00:08:09.955 --> 00:08:11.180
Leave your things here.

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:05.380
(The Grave of Father)

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:12.900
Li Wu.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.180
Why haven't you gone to school

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:17.100
these past couple of days?

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:19.140
I can study at home too.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.840
If everyone could make it
on their own through self-learning,

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:24.300
then why even go to school?

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:27.740
You have to study well,

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:29.660
learn knowledge,

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:31.540
and go out.

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:34.420
Don't be like me,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.420
trapped here in the mountains.

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.620
(The Grave of Father)

00:11:34.511 --> 00:11:35.980
Why aren't you getting in the car?

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:36.820
I didn't lock it.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.620
How long have I been asleep?

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:47.420
How long have you been standing here?

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:50.140
I...

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:52.060
Are you crazy?

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:53.540
Why didn't you wake me up?

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:56.060
Get in the car.

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:03.860
What are you doing?

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:06.860
My shoes are muddy.

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:08.180
Mine too.

00:12:08.866 --> 00:12:10.000
The car is already dirty.

00:12:10.022 --> 00:12:11.311
We can wash the car tomorrow.

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:12.660
Get in the car.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:48.540
Wipe it off.

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:51.980
Your forehead got some dirt.

00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:58.380
Well...

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:10.780
Thank you.

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:57.180
Are you hungry? Want to eat something?

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:01.620
I...

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:03.580
I'm not hungry.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:05.100
I'm hungry.

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:01.980
Eat then.

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:44.060
Hey, Mom.

00:15:44.244 --> 00:15:45.540
Why are you still awake so late?

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:46.740
I can't sleep.

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:48.180
What's wrong?

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:52.540
I went to your place today.

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:55.460
Why didn't you tell me beforehand?

00:15:55.488 --> 00:15:57.444
Have you been living separately
from Wu Fu?

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:00.500
Impossible.

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:02.940
Wu Fu said so?

00:16:03.244 --> 00:16:04.844
Do I need someone else to tell me?

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:06.060
I can tell

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:07.260
if you're living there or not.

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:10.260
There's not a trace of life.

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:11.380
Not a single

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:12.900
thing you usually use.

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:14.460
And I can see

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:15.660
that you moved out

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:16.820
not just for a day or two.

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:18.900
It's because of this

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:20.540
that I toss and turn and can't sleep.

00:16:22.111 --> 00:16:23.180
I'm getting a divorce.

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:26.700
Why this time?

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:31.980
Just can't continue like this.

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:35.140
You always say things in anger.

00:16:35.466 --> 00:16:36.980
Divorce, divorce, divorce, and divorce.

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:38.860
I've heard you say that
a few times already.

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:42.580
This time it was him.

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:48.020
Wu Fu mentioned it?

00:16:48.466 --> 00:16:49.660
Why did he bring it up?

00:16:50.222 --> 00:16:51.555
What gives him the right?

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:55.140
Hey.

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:56.580
Speak, where are you?

00:16:58.311 --> 00:16:59.860
I just came back from Yunfeng Village.

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:02.060
Yunfeng?

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:04.220
Why did you go to Yunfeng?

00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:05.700
Give the phone to Dad.

00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:12.500
Jin.

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:13.420
What's going on?

00:17:14.244 --> 00:17:15.540
Dad, I want to ask you something.

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:17.220
Do you know

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:18.460
Mr. Qi from Yi City High School?

00:17:19.533 --> 00:17:21.100
The one from Yi City High School before.

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:22.480
He was head of the math department.

00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:24.620
He should be working at Yingcai now.

00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:27.060
Yes. Are you looking for him
for something?

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:29.380
It's about the child you sponsored

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:30.500
in Yunfeng.

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:33.500
Because of some issues at home,

00:17:33.533 --> 00:17:34.980
he missed the college entrance exam.

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:37.100
So I want

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:38.380
to consult Mr. Qi

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:39.355
about repeating a year.

00:17:41.022 --> 00:17:43.100
Actually, the situation
is a bit complicated.

00:17:43.533 --> 00:17:45.060
I've already brought the child back.

00:17:45.266 --> 00:17:46.460
I want him to continue studying

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:47.300
in Yi City.

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:49.620
So I wanted to contact Mr. Qi...

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:50.460
What did you say?

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:52.340
Who did you bring back?

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:53.900
Li Wu.

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:55.220
You brought Li Wu back?

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:56.780
Jin.

00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:57.860
Are you crazy?

00:17:58.220 --> 00:17:59.100
Such a big matter,

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:00.780
you and I, and your dad...

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:01.911
Did we discuss it together?

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:03.380
Did you discuss it with Wu Fu?

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:05.460
You're in the middle of a divorce,

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.620
and you still have time to worry
about this?

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:09.740
Then if I don't, who will?

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:11.220
Wu Fu doesn't want to.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:13.020
Should you and my dad take care of it?

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:15.060
The child called.

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:15.980
If I don't step in,

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:17.244
just let him fend for himself?

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:19.140
You still have time to manage others.

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:20.580
Take care of yourself first.

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:22.140
How come I haven't taken care of myself?

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:23.620
I'm fine.

00:18:23.777 --> 00:18:24.755
And this child isn't

00:18:24.755 --> 00:18:26.511
the one you were supposed
to sponsor back then?

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:27.820
If not you,

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.940
why would I drive all night
to come back?

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:30.780
Back then,

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:32.620
you and Wu Fu

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:34.100
told us not to go.

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:35.340
You two go handle it.

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:37.220
Back then,

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:38.540
who insisted on marrying Wu Fu?

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:39.660
Was it you?

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:40.580
And now,

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:41.900
you blame your dad and me.

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:44.100
You're already separated.

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:45.820
You kept it from your parents.

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:47.220
Even if we wanted to,

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:48.340
we couldn't interfere.

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:49.780
Right.

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:51.100
It's all my fault.

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:51.860
You're not wrong.

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:53.300
I'm just being willful, okay?

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:54.750
Anyway, I've brought the child back.

00:18:54.755 --> 00:18:56.066
No need to worry. I'll handle it!

00:18:58.100 --> 00:18:59.180
Hey.

00:19:32.755 --> 00:19:34.380
I can only take you to my house first.

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:43.940
My house isn't big,
but it has two rooms.

00:19:44.111 --> 00:19:45.844
You can stay in the guest room for now.

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:49.100
Okay.

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:36.580
Why are you out there?

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:43.260
Come in.

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:55.300
Once you've changed, come in.

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:56.460
I'll wash my face.

00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:57.860
You can sit anywhere.

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.740
Why are you just standing there?

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:42.940
Sit.

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:49.300
Go ahead.

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:50.540
You can put your luggage here.

00:22:13.711 --> 00:22:15.580
I cooked yesterday, hope you don't mind.

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:18.020
Thanks.

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:45.980
Your delivery.

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:47.220
Thanks.

00:22:58.266 --> 00:22:59.660
This fried chicken is really good.

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:00.500
You can start eating.

00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:32.380
Li Wu.

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:34.420
You're in science, right?

00:23:35.644 --> 00:23:37.700
The textbooks for the county
high school and here

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:38.540
should be the same.

00:23:38.688 --> 00:23:40.540
After all,
they're from the same province.

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:45.340
The textbooks are the same.

00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:48.660
I'll figure out a way

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:49.900
to see if I can get you

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:51.540
into the best school to repeat the year.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.540
The learning environment will be better.

00:23:57.740 --> 00:23:58.860
This is just my suggestion.

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:00.900
You don't need to feel pressured.

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:03.177
Your own thoughts
are the most important.

00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:07.580
Actually,

00:24:08.133 --> 00:24:10.044
being able to go to school
is already good.

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:15.220
Going to school

00:24:15.444 --> 00:24:17.155
is not just about attending classes.

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:19.300
It's about how to study, what to study,

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:20.140
and why to study.

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:23.460
I hope you have

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:24.844
high expectations for yourself.

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:26.300
Set a goal for yourself.

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:29.060
I brought you back

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:29.940
not for nothing.

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:31.420
There are conditions for you.

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:34.340
At least get into a 211 university.

00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:35.860
Can you do it?

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:56.880
Eat.

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:12.340
On the way back today,

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:14.140
during that phone call,

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:18.260
I was a little emotional

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:21.140
because of the argument.

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:24.820
I said some harsh words,

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:26.780
but not directed at you.

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:29.140
I hope you don't take it to heart.

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:34.900
Okay.

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:36.460
I won't.

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:42.620
Li Wu, you're nineteen, right?

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:47.980
Then just call me sister from now on.

00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:57.340
Don't call me?

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:07.900
Sister.

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:10.020
Eat.

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:24.740
This is your room.

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:30.620
Sheets, pillows

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:32.740
and a blanket are all on the bed.

00:26:32.822 --> 00:26:34.300
You can set it up yourself later.

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:37.380
The wardrobe and drawers are empty.

00:26:37.733 --> 00:26:38.940

Message me when you can.)

(So tired.)

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:05.180
(I went to Yunfeng,)

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:07.020
(and brought that child back.)

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:26.620
Hey.

00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:28.460
You're amazing.

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:31.980
You brought a child back from Yunfeng.

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:35.660
You're not doing it to get back
at Wu Fu, right?

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:37.660
Don't mention it.

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:39.180
I just couldn't take

00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:41.180
Wu Fu's indifferent attitude.

00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:42.700
It felt so cold-blooded.

00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:44.500
I got heated

00:29:44.711 --> 00:29:45.780
and acted impulsively.

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:47.500
So what now?

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:49.900
I originally planned

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:51.140
to send him to my parents.

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:54.500
But because of Wu Fu,

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:55.580
I argued with my mom.

00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:57.740
I even said some harsh words,

00:29:58.022 --> 00:29:59.340
so I couldn't send him to them.

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:01.180
Then...

00:30:02.044 --> 00:30:03.977
Let him stay at your place
for two days first.

00:30:03.977 --> 00:30:05.260
School starts in a couple of days.

00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:06.660
Does that mean he can stay on campus?

00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:08.500
Chang.

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:10.020
I won't tell you now.

00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:10.860
My mom is here.

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:13.220
Chang.

00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:14.620
I will leave tomorrow.

00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:15.620
Look.

00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:16.460
This is Yang Hao.

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:17.540
Go meet him.

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:19.860
You came to me

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:21.066
just for this matter, right?

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:22.180
Yes.

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:23.100
Just this matter.

00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:34.460
You...

00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:36.060
Why didn't you dry off?

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:39.940
Because I just finished showering.

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:54.500
This is prepared for you.

00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:57.740
Dry off quickly.

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:08.860
I put the stomach medicine on the table.

00:33:09.111 --> 00:33:10.311
Take it before sleeping.

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:18.940
Okay.

00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:15.780
Morning.

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:17.700
Morning, Sister.

00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:21.660
Did you take medicine yesterday?

00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:25.580
Yes.

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:28.180
Is your stomach still hurting?

00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:31.900
No.

00:35:33.577 --> 00:35:35.860
You don't have to force yourself
to eat if you can't.

00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:37.420
You can just tell me.

00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:39.620
No, it's...

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:42.260
I...

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:46.700
I ate too much yesterday.

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:50.740
Here, take this first.

00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:56.260
I forgot to tell you yesterday.

00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:57.660
This is the sofa bed.

00:36:01.133 --> 00:36:02.300
Don't even know how you

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:03.140
slept yesterday.

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:04.980
This...

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:06.620
Help pull it out together.

00:36:12.888 --> 00:36:14.100
Put the sheets on first.

00:36:20.644 --> 00:36:22.688
Have some porridge
to settle your stomach first.

00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:37.460
Sister.

00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:38.900
Actually,

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:41.060
I can make breakfast.

00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:45.980
Do you often cook?

00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:51.500
Alright.

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:53.180
Anyway, there's everything at home.

00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:54.700
If you need anything,

00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:55.540
tell me.

00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:58.260
Okay.

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:07.100
Here.

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:18.700
Your eyes are beautiful.

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:20.180
Inherited from your mom?

00:37:26.422 --> 00:37:27.980
Then your mom must be very pretty.

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:31.020
Actually, I don't really remember.

00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:33.688
There's also no photo
of my mom at home.

00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:39.620
Sorry.

00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:40.820
I just asked casually.

00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:41.660
It's okay.

00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:43.860
No problem.

00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:52.060
Li Wu.

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:53.940
From now on, no matter

00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:55.088
what difficulties you face,

00:37:55.133 --> 00:37:56.180
you can tell me,

00:37:57.340 --> 00:37:58.500
just like family.

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:06.300
But I will return the money to you.

00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:09.460
Don't worry about money for now.

00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:11.300
Focus on studying first.

00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:13.420
You can earn money later.

00:38:24.866 --> 00:38:26.380
I still don't have much appetite.

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:28.300
I want to buy some fruit.

00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:29.380
Do you want anything?

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:31.620
I don't need any.

00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:33.260
Okay.

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:34.540
Then I'll just buy randomly.

00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:30.220
Hello.

00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:31.422
Do you need extra food?

00:40:33.688 --> 00:40:35.022
What do you want to eat?

00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:36.500
You know already.

00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:41.577
One nut salad, please.

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:43.620
And add a serving
of Snow Mountain mashed potatoes.

00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:44.460
Okay.

00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:45.540
Wait.

00:40:45.666 --> 00:40:46.933
Cancel the previous order.

00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:48.620
Change it to thick-cut ribeye

00:40:48.622 --> 00:40:49.888
and black vinegar mushrooms.

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:51.180
Okay, please wait.

00:40:58.980 --> 00:40:59.820
Keep talking.

00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:01.140
Why is it when I come,

00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:02.100
you all stop talking?

00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:04.140
We were just talking

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:05.220
about the project plan.

00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:07.740
Jin.

00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:08.700
Are you on vacation?

00:41:08.777 --> 00:41:10.900
I was curious, when I went
to your company just now,

00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:11.740
why didn't I see you?

00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:15.860
I was also curious why today at lunch,

00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:17.100
it was just the two of you?

00:41:17.866 --> 00:41:19.020
Where's everyone else?

00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:21.100
They...

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:22.460
Why are you being sarcastic?

00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:33.660
Say whatever you want.

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:35.540
This is really boring.

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:39.540
I just wanted to have a meal.

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:41.740
Okay.

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:43.340
Then let's eat.

00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:47.020
Try this.

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:48.620
Eat properly.

00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:49.900
Eat.

00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:52.540
Mr. Wu,

00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:54.740
I'll serve myself.

00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:56.260
No need to trouble you.

00:41:57.740 --> 00:41:58.980
You just focus on the client.

00:41:59.044 --> 00:42:00.620
My work doesn't need your interference.

00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:01.780
If you said so earlier,

00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:02.660
we wouldn't have

00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:03.820
grown in the same company.

00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:17.020
I have a meeting this afternoon.

00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:18.460
You two can talk first.

00:42:46.577 --> 00:42:47.940
I suddenly don't want to eat.

00:42:49.755 --> 00:42:50.940
You have a good appetite,

00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:52.380
so just eat it all.
