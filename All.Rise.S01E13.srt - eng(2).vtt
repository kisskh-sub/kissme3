(Talent Hunt Program Day 45)

00:01:50.216 --> 00:01:52.232
(Jiang Chen 4, Huang Yue 3, Li Ke 3)

(Hangzhou)

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.050
By the way, I also heard
from their people

00:01:58.089 --> 00:01:59.889
Zhu Zhisheng's mother has not,

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:01.650
to this day, hired a lawyer.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.329
These demands she's making

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.369
were negotiated directly
with the company.

00:02:05.896 --> 00:02:06.633
Impressive, huh?

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.010
Leveraging the IPO timing
for compensation.

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:11.889
She proposed it herself?

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.449
No lawyer involved?

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:17.410
Never underestimate a mother's strength.

00:02:25.704 --> 00:02:27.336
(Ren Jiatong: I've arrived in Hangzhou.)

00:02:27.432 --> 00:02:33.576
(Here's the hotel location. Let's meet.)

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:39.370
She asked you what she should do?

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:43.690
I explained
the work-related injury claim process

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:44.530
to her thoroughly.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.209
I also highlighted

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.410
some key points

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.410
for labor dispute negotiations
with employers.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.169
It was on our way to the hospital.

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:53.649
I didn't know Jun An

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:54.850
would represent Yiaiwan.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.010
That's all?

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:06.810
I can't recall any more details.

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:08.729
Learning Zhubao was in a coma

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:09.769
made my hands tremble.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.690
My mind was completely chaotic.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.889
Jiatong.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.169
Have I caused trouble?

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.090
Does anyone else besides you two know?

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:22.209
I immediately told Mr. Zhou

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:23.329
about our relationship

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.209
and told him I was currently in Hangzhou

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.729
and that I'd recuse myself.

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.090
But I didn't dare tell Mr. Zhou

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:30.850
that I gave Ms. Wang

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.090
legal advice.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:35.729
What you told her

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:37.449
were just standard legal suggestions.

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:39.169
And you never participated

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:40.049
in the Jun An topic.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.850
So it's alright.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.290
But from now on,

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.130
you shouldn't discuss this with anyone.

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:46.850
I'll keep it secret too.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.530
In just two days,

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.889
you look much thinner already.

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:00.810
All those fasts never worked before,

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:03.329
but sleeplessness does the trick.

00:04:06.929 --> 00:04:07.690
Get some sleep now.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.810
Your body will break down otherwise.

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:11.290
Jiatong.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.410
I can't sleep.

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:16.370
Just lie here with me.

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.089
Can we talk a bit?

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.730
Zhubao isn't the first employee

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.209
to collapse at Yiaiwan.

00:04:35.769 --> 00:04:36.649
Recently,

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.849
several former employees' families

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:41.130
have contacted Ms. Wang.

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:43.610
That's how we learned

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.769
that over a year ago,

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.490
an identical case occurred.

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:52.610
Jiatong.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.170
Do you still believe
it's all coincidence?

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.409
I'm honestly starting to doubt it.

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:05.529
Even though I'm recused from this case,

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:08.490
what about the future?

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.449
If I practice law

00:05:12.329 --> 00:05:13.730
and face conflicts

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:16.329
between justice and client interests,

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.010
should I force myself

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:20.889
to abandon my original ideals

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:23.409
and convince myself

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.730
client interests must come first?

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:31.529
Not that Yiaiwan is definitely at fault.

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:33.209
I have no proof.

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:36.969
But Jiatong,

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:39.209
what about you?

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:43.529
If you were Zhubao

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.529
or that employee's family,

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:52.089
seeing your loved one like this,

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:54.849
could you stay rational?

00:05:58.344 --> 00:06:02.889
(Emergency)

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:03.690
Family member?

00:06:04.329 --> 00:06:05.010
Patient's jacket.

00:06:13.352 --> 00:06:16.552
(Estazolam Tablets)

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:30.529
Jiatong.

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:34.449
Are you asleep?

00:07:35.752 --> 00:07:38.024
(Jiang Chen
to Ren Jiatong)

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.937
(Thank you for feeding it for me.)

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.033
(I was just passing by.)

00:08:00.392 --> 00:08:02.984
(The shopkeeper told me
you went there every day.)

00:08:07.848 --> 00:08:09.385
(I won't feed it tomorrow anyway.)

00:08:09.576 --> 00:08:11.272
(It eats too much. I can't afford it.)

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.585
(Come back and take over.)

00:08:15.784 --> 00:08:17.929
(It just told me it misses you.)

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:35.169
I'm an intern from Yiaiwan R&D.

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.250
Mr. Zhou is meeting
with our department head.

00:08:37.529 --> 00:08:39.370
He instructed us to give you this.

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:41.850
Zhu's recent clock-in/out records.

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:44.049
I'll email the digital version shortly.

00:08:44.929 --> 00:08:45.450
Thank you.

00:08:47.689 --> 00:08:48.250
Xiaojing.

00:08:49.769 --> 00:08:51.769
I heard you people provided a copy

00:08:51.769 --> 00:08:52.850
for Zhu Zhisheng's mother.

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:53.929
Was it this one?

00:08:55.769 --> 00:08:56.769
I wasn't there then,

00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:58.210
so I don't know specifics.

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:00.289
But based on your knowledge,

00:09:00.289 --> 00:09:02.450
did your colleagues give
his mother a hard time?

00:09:02.809 --> 00:09:04.450
Like intentionally delaying documents?

00:09:04.689 --> 00:09:06.850
Impossible. We're all colleagues.

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:07.610
How could that be?

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:12.610
Well.

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:14.569
If there's nothing else, I'll leave.

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:16.330
Right, let's swap WeChat IDs.

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:17.809
Contact me whenever.

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:18.600
Okay.

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:21.169
You know Zhu Zhisheng, right?

00:09:21.689 --> 00:09:23.610
Of course, we're in the same department.

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:25.289
We did team-building events.

00:09:25.929 --> 00:09:26.809
But...

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:28.090
we're not close.

00:09:31.809 --> 00:09:33.689
We'll contact you if needed.

00:09:34.649 --> 00:09:35.210
I'll leave.

00:09:46.689 --> 00:09:49.289
Zhu Zhisheng was found
unconscious in the company garage.

00:09:49.529 --> 00:09:51.169
It happened around 10 PM.

00:09:51.529 --> 00:09:53.490
But that day's clock-out record

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:55.569
showed he left the office at 7 PM.

00:09:55.809 --> 00:09:57.450
He was gone for three hours.

00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:58.649
And his car didn't move.

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:00.569
Meaning he couldn't have gone far.

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:01.929
Perhaps in the complex.

00:10:03.169 --> 00:10:04.970
From his start date till now,

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:06.689
it's been nearly six months.

00:10:07.049 --> 00:10:08.689
But he worked overtime almost every day.

00:10:08.929 --> 00:10:11.289
The earliest he'd leave was past 10 PM.

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:13.210
He genuinely worked hard.

00:10:13.409 --> 00:10:15.169
I heard from Guo Xiaoyu earlier

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:16.929
that he'd work extremely late

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:18.529
and then go home and video-call her.

00:10:19.049 --> 00:10:21.450
At least, he didn't lie
to Guo Xiaoyu about that.

00:10:22.289 --> 00:10:23.649
But these past two weeks,

00:10:23.769 --> 00:10:25.610
he's been leaving around 8 PM.

00:10:25.889 --> 00:10:28.169
Then returning around 10 PM.

00:10:28.289 --> 00:10:30.330
But his mother told Guo Xiaoyu

00:10:30.689 --> 00:10:32.610
he usually worked until 11 or 12 PM

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:33.370
before coming home,

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:35.529
and that when she went
for the clock-in records,

00:10:35.529 --> 00:10:36.370
she got stonewalled.

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:38.090
Why would Zhu's mother

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:39.809
lie to Guo Xiaoyu?

00:10:40.289 --> 00:10:41.049
And why did she

00:10:41.049 --> 00:10:42.929
insist on private negotiations

00:10:42.929 --> 00:10:43.970
instead of formal claims?

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:45.569
We could suggest Mr. Zhou.

00:10:45.769 --> 00:10:47.330
Have her make an offer directly.

00:10:48.769 --> 00:10:51.010
You're hoping her proposal reveals

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:52.610
her true intentions.

00:10:52.809 --> 00:10:55.049
See if she's seeking huge compensation

00:10:55.049 --> 00:10:56.330
by hiding something.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:57.850
Smart.

00:10:58.130 --> 00:10:59.529
But one thing's certain.

00:10:59.809 --> 00:11:00.889
These two weeks coincide

00:11:01.289 --> 00:11:03.370
with Xiaoyu and Zhu Zhisheng's cold war.

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:06.610
During those three hours
after clocking out,

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:09.130
he might've done something

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:09.850
with someone.

00:11:12.569 --> 00:11:13.289
Weibo.

00:11:13.992 --> 00:11:15.144
(Quiet Woods: Sunny day.)

00:11:20.529 --> 00:11:21.330
Almost done.

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:21.970
Thank you.

00:11:22.929 --> 00:11:24.450
No, I should say thank you.

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:29.529
A little sleepy.

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:32.090
Inside the complex,

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:33.730
any standout cafes you'd recommend?

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:37.544
This one?

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:51.090
This...

00:11:51.809 --> 00:11:52.850
I'm not too sure.

00:11:53.409 --> 00:11:54.169
I haven't visited.

00:11:56.569 --> 00:11:57.689
Reviews say

00:11:57.809 --> 00:11:59.809
it's the highest-rated cafe here.

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:01.090
Really?

00:12:05.689 --> 00:12:06.250
Excuse me.

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:07.649
Hello, Xiaoyu.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:08.850
Jiatong.

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:11.049
Zhubao just got rushed
to emergency care.

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:11.970
What should I do?

00:12:17.569 --> 00:12:19.490
Didn't you say this approach would work?

00:12:19.809 --> 00:12:20.450
Don't worry.

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:22.049
I'll definitely handle this for you.

00:12:22.049 --> 00:12:23.210
Since we've set this up,

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:23.809
it'll be fine.

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:24.730
On your end...

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:25.610
Family of Bed 1,

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:27.049
buy a cream to prevent bedsores.

00:12:27.409 --> 00:12:28.490
Okay, I'll get it shortly.

00:12:37.416 --> 00:12:38.152
(Esazolam Tablets:
Sedative, sleeping pills.)

00:12:38.152 --> 00:12:38.696
(Primarily used to treat
anxiety and insomnia)

00:12:38.696 --> 00:12:39.464
(and also tension, fear,
epilepsy and seizures.)

00:12:39.464 --> 00:12:40.552
(Esazolam Tablets:
Sedative, sleeping pills.)

00:12:40.552 --> 00:12:41.320
(Primarily used to treat
anxiety and insomnia)

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.120
(and also tension, fear,
epilepsy and seizures.)

00:12:48.169 --> 00:12:48.769
Xiaoyu.

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:50.889
Since you work at that firm,

00:12:51.169 --> 00:12:53.210
couldn't you reason
with your supervisor?

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:55.330
This endless delay without compensation

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:57.689
is downright immoral.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.569
Ms. Wang, I don't know
how to tell you this.

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:02.809
But Jun An

00:13:02.809 --> 00:13:04.330
isn't the unethical firm you imagine.

00:13:04.929 --> 00:13:06.250
You need a professional lawyer

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:06.850
to help you.

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:08.809
Aren't you studying law?

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:09.889
Yes.

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:12.889
I am. But Ms. Wang,

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:15.610
my position is extremely awkward.

00:13:16.169 --> 00:13:17.689
I can't offer you any advice.

00:13:17.704 --> 00:13:18.330
And I can't

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:19.689
get involved in this matter.

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:20.610
Xiaoyu.

00:13:21.929 --> 00:13:23.289
You're a good kid.

00:13:23.889 --> 00:13:25.330
You've been together for many years.

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:26.569
He's in such a state now.

00:13:26.569 --> 00:13:27.929
You can't just abandon him.

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:28.730
Xiaoyu.

00:13:30.289 --> 00:13:30.970
What's wrong?

00:13:31.169 --> 00:13:32.210
Just my usual stomachache.

00:13:34.169 --> 00:13:35.409
Give the barrier cream to her.

00:13:37.689 --> 00:13:39.689
Ms. Wang, this is for Zhubao.

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:41.130
Well.

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:43.569
I-I-I'll take my colleague
to the emergency room.

00:13:44.169 --> 00:13:44.929
Xiaoyu.

00:13:45.569 --> 00:13:46.330
Xiaoyu.

00:13:53.569 --> 00:13:55.169
Thanks for helping me out earlier.

00:13:55.409 --> 00:13:56.450
You acted so convincingly.

00:13:57.970 --> 00:13:59.289
But her coming to you this time

00:13:59.529 --> 00:14:00.450
is not simple.

00:14:01.409 --> 00:14:01.970
I know.

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:04.610
She never mentioned Jun An before.

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:06.409
But I trust Ms. Wang.

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:08.090
She was our Chinese teacher.

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:10.610
I think she's just extremely anxious.

00:14:10.689 --> 00:14:12.689
So she wants to get information from me.

00:14:15.529 --> 00:14:17.330
Yiaiwan avoids
official work injury status

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:20.210
because it'd hurt
the company's reputation too much.

00:14:20.689 --> 00:14:22.409
Big companies often
avoid acknowledging it.

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:25.130
Especially since Yiaiwan
has IPO plans now.

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:27.169
It could draw
regulatory scrutiny easily.

00:14:28.169 --> 00:14:28.730
Moreover,

00:14:28.929 --> 00:14:31.169
the company will pay
part of the compensation.

00:14:32.809 --> 00:14:34.330
But Ms. Wang refuses

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.450
to get compensated
through official channels.

00:14:36.689 --> 00:14:37.929
She wants a private payout.

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:40.730
Don't you find that suspicious?

00:14:42.409 --> 00:14:42.929
But

00:14:43.289 --> 00:14:44.769
Zhu Zhisheng's collapse this time

00:14:44.769 --> 00:14:46.649
hit Ms. Wang incredibly hard.

00:14:47.889 --> 00:14:48.809
I've asked her.

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:51.289
The treatment costs are sky-high.

00:14:51.289 --> 00:14:52.370
She's completely panicked.

00:14:52.689 --> 00:14:53.929
The insurance may not cover it.

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:54.970
Moreover,

00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:57.169
the work injury process
is so complicated.

00:14:57.169 --> 00:14:58.210
No wonder she's confused.

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:00.090
Is Zhu Zhisheng alright?

00:15:01.049 --> 00:15:02.090
I just spoke to him.

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:03.049
He seemed conscious.

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:05.130
He'll wake up for sure.

00:15:11.169 --> 00:15:12.049
Don't worry.

00:15:12.169 --> 00:15:13.210
We can handle this.

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:14.490
We have procedures for this.

00:15:17.689 --> 00:15:18.210
What's wrong?

00:15:19.769 --> 00:15:20.328
Nothing.

00:15:21.289 --> 00:15:22.289
These past few days,

00:15:22.409 --> 00:15:24.330
have Zhu Zhisheng's relatives
come to help?

00:15:25.529 --> 00:15:27.409
No, Ms. Wang's been running around

00:15:27.409 --> 00:15:29.090
all alone.

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:30.649
I haven't seen anyone else.

00:15:30.809 --> 00:15:32.610
She's beyond exhausted.

00:15:33.289 --> 00:15:34.090
You too.

00:15:34.289 --> 00:15:35.490
Go home and get sleep later.

00:15:37.569 --> 00:15:38.169
Jiatong.

00:15:38.569 --> 00:15:39.769
Can I stay at your place

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:41.210
one more night?

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:43.689
I didn't tell my parents I came here.

00:15:43.889 --> 00:15:45.250
I didn't want them to worry.

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:55.250
Jiatong.

00:15:56.289 --> 00:15:57.649
You're so thoughtful with me.

00:15:57.649 --> 00:15:59.130
I'm actually not used to it.

00:16:02.169 --> 00:16:03.169
If you get sick,

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:05.090
I'll miss your cooking back in Beijing.

00:16:09.569 --> 00:16:10.809
Keep pretending you're tough.

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:13.090
I know

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:15.010
you've already considered me a friend.

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:18.920
Jiatong.

00:16:19.169 --> 00:16:19.889
Thank you.

00:16:20.569 --> 00:16:21.490
And Yan Fei too.

00:16:22.569 --> 00:16:24.289
I know you both came to Hangzhou

00:16:24.289 --> 00:16:25.090
just for me.

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:28.330
Not just me in my family,

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:30.490
even my parents are only children.

00:16:31.929 --> 00:16:32.970
This time,

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:34.450
I finally know

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:36.049
what having an elder sister is like.

00:16:37.649 --> 00:16:38.250
You two.

00:16:39.049 --> 00:16:39.809
One,

00:16:40.289 --> 00:16:41.689
tough-talker with a soft heart,

00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:43.610
and the other,

00:16:43.929 --> 00:16:44.689
passionately loyal.

00:16:45.049 --> 00:16:45.689
And Yue,

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:47.169
she messages me daily

00:16:48.169 --> 00:16:49.330
to cheer me up.

00:16:52.569 --> 00:16:54.049
Honestly, after joining Jun An,

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:58.010
my biggest gain was you all.

00:17:03.409 --> 00:17:04.809
I asked people at the cafe.

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:05.769
Listen,

00:17:05.769 --> 00:17:06.369
that night,

00:17:06.369 --> 00:17:08.329
Zhu Zhisheng
was definitely with that woman.

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:09.769
But surveillance stopped.

00:17:09.849 --> 00:17:11.250
They described a girl

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:12.809
with a round face and a sweet smile.

00:17:13.289 --> 00:17:15.329
It must be that intern, Xiaojing.

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:17.170
Her conversation with me seemed odd.

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:18.529
After you left today,

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:20.170
I asked Mr. Zhou to check

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:21.450
the department's clock-in data

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:22.809
over the past half-month.

00:17:23.369 --> 00:17:25.129
That girl's post-work comings and goings

00:17:25.129 --> 00:17:26.450
match Zhu Zhisheng's

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:27.970
almost exactly.

00:17:28.809 --> 00:17:30.049
What a scumbag.

00:17:30.849 --> 00:17:31.368
By the way.

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:36.049
I'm sending you her selfie
from social media.

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:38.490
Check it out at the cafe if you can.

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:40.730
Has Guo Xiaoyu been told?

00:17:41.329 --> 00:17:41.930
Not yet.

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:44.129
It's too much pressure.

00:17:45.089 --> 00:17:47.049
She's already torn between both sides.

00:17:47.049 --> 00:17:47.930
It's been hard enough.

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:49.970
How's she now?

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:54.769
She's asleep.

00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:56.690
Let's tell her

00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:57.930
after this blows over.

00:17:59.529 --> 00:18:00.129
Alright.

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:01.650
Please help take care of her.

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:16.289
Not going back?

00:18:18.049 --> 00:18:19.769
You work this late.

00:18:19.769 --> 00:18:21.210
How could I leave early?

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:27.170
Hangzhou is lovely.

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:30.344
Mr. Zhou.

00:18:30.809 --> 00:18:31.970
Is the suggestion

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:33.289
Ren Jiatong and I proposed okay?

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:36.010
I just talked

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:37.450
to Zhu's mother with Yiaiwan.

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:39.650
We asked her to submit
a compensation proposal.

00:18:39.849 --> 00:18:40.930
She sent it immediately.

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:42.849
How is it? A ridiculous demand?

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:44.200
No.

00:18:45.049 --> 00:18:46.529
The amount she requested

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:48.010
is only slightly higher

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:49.369
than the work injury claim amount

00:18:49.369 --> 00:18:50.210
we estimated.

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:52.049
"Only slightly higher"?

00:18:53.049 --> 00:18:55.170
Then why the banner protests

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:56.369
and disturbances?

00:18:56.849 --> 00:18:58.450
She refused to file for work injury.

00:18:58.450 --> 00:18:59.970
Does she know

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:01.450
Zhu Zhisheng's coma

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:03.809
wasn't actually caused by overtime work?

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:06.049
So she's pushing for extra compensation

00:19:06.049 --> 00:19:07.250
before Yiaiwan's IPO?

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:08.809
It's entirely possible.

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:13.970
What actually caused his coma?

00:19:14.329 --> 00:19:15.410
What was he really doing

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:16.529
during those three hours?

00:19:17.569 --> 00:19:19.289
Could he have a major health issue?

00:19:20.329 --> 00:19:21.769
Guo Xiaoyu shouldn't be with him.

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:24.690
Why so worked up

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:26.450
about urging her breakup?

00:19:26.569 --> 00:19:28.329
That two-timer
doesn't deserve Guo Xiaoyu.

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:31.010
And he kept pressuring her
to return to Hangzhou.

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:32.569
What's so great about Hangzhou anyway?

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:34.210
Once this matter is resolved,

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:35.529
I'll take her straight back.

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:08.609
The osmanthus smells good.

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:10.568
Take a whiff.

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:20.392
Smells good.

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:24.329
Osmanthus wine tastes even better.

00:20:24.609 --> 00:20:26.210
Our housekeeper brews it often.

00:20:26.769 --> 00:20:27.890
Layering osmanthus blossoms.

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:29.369
Then a layer of rock sugar.

00:20:29.369 --> 00:20:31.490
Finally filled with baijiu.

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:49.730
Actually, Hangzhou

00:20:51.049 --> 00:20:51.849
is growing on me.

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:15.529
I see.

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:17.369
This place is a bar at night.

00:21:17.529 --> 00:21:19.289
Zhu Zhisheng might
drink here that night.

00:21:20.089 --> 00:21:20.690
What?

00:21:21.089 --> 00:21:21.890
Go find evidence.

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:41.384
(If there's something)

00:21:41.576 --> 00:21:43.337
(you're unsure whether to do,)

00:21:43.944 --> 00:21:45.058
(what would you do?)

00:21:50.472 --> 00:21:51.625
(Indecision isn't like you.)

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:01.384
Hello?

00:22:01.849 --> 00:22:02.690
How is Guo Xiaoyu?

00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:04.690
You know already?

00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:08.450
You and Yan Fei were in the pantry,

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:09.369
acting all mysterious.

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:11.170
Guo Xiaoyu took a sudden leave.

00:22:11.609 --> 00:22:12.849
And Yiaiwan is in Hangzhou.

00:22:13.129 --> 00:22:14.690
Put these pieces together.

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:16.450
Plenty of possibilities emerge.

00:22:17.369 --> 00:22:19.170
I asked a friend at Yiaiwan.

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:20.010
Just an inquiry.

00:22:20.129 --> 00:22:21.730
I got the whole story instantly.

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:24.289
She's been tired these days.

00:22:24.529 --> 00:22:25.650
She barely slept at all.

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:27.210
You're not much better.

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:28.930
Even your voice sounds drained.

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:30.970
Didn't you take care of yourself well?

00:22:33.329 --> 00:22:33.970
What about you?

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:34.849
How are things lately?

00:22:35.784 --> 00:22:37.704
Remember that goal you set?

00:22:38.849 --> 00:22:40.450
The three of us
are busy with Min's case.

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:43.010
We'll probably pull
an all-nighter today.

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:45.369
You need to take care of yourself.

00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:48.609
Today,

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:49.450
I saw Zhu Zhisheng

00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:50.490
lying in the ICU.

00:22:51.089 --> 00:22:52.410
He's our age.

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:54.930
Just like us,

00:22:55.129 --> 00:22:56.690
he works all night every single day.

00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:00.490
But...

00:23:06.129 --> 00:23:08.049
Sorry, I lost control
of my emotions today.

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:12.450
Losing control just means
you're flesh and blood.

00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:15.450
If you didn't react to anything,

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:16.289
it'd be terrifying.

00:23:20.769 --> 00:23:21.890
Do you want to discuss it?

00:23:23.289 --> 00:23:23.849
About what?

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:25.970
Whatever is making you hesitate.

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:28.970
It actually needs close attention.

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:31.049
Indulge my curiosity?

00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:35.650
Well,

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:38.450
I have a friend

00:23:39.769 --> 00:23:40.890
whom I really care about.

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:44.289
I discovered something

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:46.010
about her.

00:23:46.769 --> 00:23:47.970
If I speak up,

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:49.529
it could hurt her.

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:51.650
But if I don't,

00:23:52.210 --> 00:23:53.650
she might get into trouble.

00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:56.730
I don't know what to do.

00:24:00.529 --> 00:24:02.529
I can't give you more details.

00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:04.369
That's the gist of it.

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:05.384
Understood.

00:24:05.849 --> 00:24:06.730
I won't ask further.

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:09.890
This is rare.

00:24:10.049 --> 00:24:11.970
You used to act without hesitation.

00:24:12.569 --> 00:24:13.450
Just like a lion

00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:15.569
ready to hunt at any moment.

00:24:16.129 --> 00:24:17.730
Lying quietly in wait,

00:24:18.089 --> 00:24:19.210
seizing the perfect chance

00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:20.529
with a swift, precise strike.

00:24:21.129 --> 00:24:21.690
But

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:23.890
this time you're hesitating?

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:25.730
Hard to believe.

00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:28.289
I recall you once said

00:24:28.849 --> 00:24:31.049
I was the type who'd do
anything to achieve my goals.

00:24:31.609 --> 00:24:32.168
No.

00:24:33.369 --> 00:24:34.210
You're someone

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:37.089
who knows exactly what they want.

00:24:39.049 --> 00:24:39.609
Thank you.

00:24:40.329 --> 00:24:40.968
Jiang Chen.

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:43.650
I'm very happy

00:24:45.289 --> 00:24:47.369
that I'm your first call
when trouble hits.

00:24:52.769 --> 00:24:53.650
Are you at the hotel?

00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:55.529
I'm sitting in the garden.

00:24:57.289 --> 00:24:57.864
Look up.

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:11.010
Using Jiang Chen's advice,

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:11.890
I found sales contacts

00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:13.170
for the defendant company.

00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:14.930
I added them on WeChat and talked

00:26:15.329 --> 00:26:16.289
until they slipped up.

00:26:16.289 --> 00:26:17.210
Their company

00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:18.289
is inside this building.

00:26:18.529 --> 00:26:19.569
His strategy worked.

00:26:20.129 --> 00:26:21.490
I sent you all those chat logs,

00:26:21.609 --> 00:26:23.170
and cross-referencing took forever.

00:26:24.049 --> 00:26:25.129
Still no exact location.

00:26:25.769 --> 00:26:26.369
No worries.

00:26:26.369 --> 00:26:27.089
We're here.

00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:28.010
Worst case,

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:29.490
we knock on every door.

00:26:29.529 --> 00:26:30.490
We'll find proof.

00:26:30.849 --> 00:26:31.930
No need for that.

00:26:32.289 --> 00:26:33.369
Check the directory.

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:34.329
Ask the front desk.

00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:35.609
Me, the property office.

00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:37.569
Share any key evidence
in the group chat.

00:26:44.296 --> 00:26:45.480
(TSA

(Beijing Ke Xin Trading Co., Ltd.)

00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:53.730
The defendant's company's name

00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:56.089
is Beijing Fei Chang Ke Xin

This directory lists
something like "Ke Xin",

00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:00.010
but I bet

00:27:00.049 --> 00:27:01.129
it's the same company.

Hello.

Hello.

00:27:07.329 --> 00:27:09.210
We chatted on WeChat earlier

00:27:09.369 --> 00:27:10.129
about our company.

00:27:10.129 --> 00:27:11.690
One moment, I'll get you some water.

00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:22.760
Excuse me.

00:27:23.369 --> 00:27:24.369

Not at all.

00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:57.089
Zhu's mom called
our boss today, and guess

00:27:57.369 --> 00:27:57.930
what she said?

00:27:58.210 --> 00:27:58.849
What?

00:27:59.250 --> 00:27:59.890
Let me show you.

00:28:01.609 --> 00:28:02.490
Pushing employees

00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:04.089
to physical collapse is nothing new

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:05.089
for your company.

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:06.529
Pay compensation.

00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:07.569
Or...

00:28:07.569 --> 00:28:09.490
I'll team up
with other employees and families

00:28:09.769 --> 00:28:11.049
and blow this up big time.

00:28:11.609 --> 00:28:12.849
I'll derail your IPO.

00:28:13.089 --> 00:28:13.769
Her exact words.

00:28:13.769 --> 00:28:14.809
IPO?

00:28:15.849 --> 00:28:16.849
How did she know?

00:28:17.129 --> 00:28:19.089
Our key tech department staff

00:28:19.089 --> 00:28:20.010
was only just told.

00:28:20.369 --> 00:28:21.650
Just a retired teacher.

00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:22.809
How'd she get such info?

00:28:23.369 --> 00:28:24.490
Who knows? Let's go.

00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:35.609
(I explained
the work-related injury claim process)

00:28:35.609 --> 00:28:36.569
(to her thoroughly.)

00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:39.650
I also highlighted some key points

00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:41.730
for labor dispute negotiations
with employers.

00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:44.690
It was on our way to the hospital.

00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:45.890
I didn't know Jun An

00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:47.170
would represent Yiaiwan.

00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:54.250
Mr. Zhou.

00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:56.490
There was a themed party
at the bar that night.

00:28:56.490 --> 00:28:58.089
All attendees were regular patrons.

00:28:58.410 --> 00:28:59.809
The bartender there

00:28:59.809 --> 00:29:01.010
took lots of pictures.

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:02.049
Including some of Zhu.

00:29:02.289 --> 00:29:03.930
I compiled those photos and evidence

00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:05.529
and sent everything to your email.

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:12.930
Do you want to say something to me?

00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:17.089
It might be

00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:18.930
inappropriate for me to say it.

00:29:19.569 --> 00:29:20.170
Well...

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:21.089
Well...

00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:22.369
About

00:29:22.769 --> 00:29:25.089
your personal connection
with Guo Xiaoyu.

00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:26.568
Just...

00:29:29.049 --> 00:29:30.250
Lawyer through and through.

00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:33.129
One sentence needs 100 qualifiers.

00:29:33.129 --> 00:29:34.730
And pre-written disclaimers.

00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:37.010
Terrified of misspeaking.

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:38.650
Are you asking me

00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:40.490
if being so close to Guo Xiaoyu

00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:42.970
means my actions will hurt her?

00:29:44.529 --> 00:29:46.690
Not something
you should ask professionally.

00:29:47.289 --> 00:29:48.089
So

00:29:48.170 --> 00:29:49.369
is this concern for me?

00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:57.769
If now's bad, I'll come back later.

00:29:58.329 --> 00:29:59.129
We're done. Come in.

00:30:05.329 --> 00:30:05.849
Mr. Zhou.

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:07.049
Yesterday, in the hospital,

00:30:07.049 --> 00:30:09.170
I saw Zhu Zhisheng's mom

00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:11.450
with an ambulance chaser
loitering in the hospital.

00:30:12.049 --> 00:30:14.250
I think that ambulance chaser is

00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:14.930
behind her timing

00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:16.730
(Ambulance chaser)
during Yiaiwan's IPO.

00:30:20.129 --> 00:30:22.569
Ambulance chasers
hunt hospital patients.

00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:24.210
They promise claim assistance,

00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:25.650
then fabricate evidence

00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:27.529
to extort huge insurance payouts

00:30:27.529 --> 00:30:29.129
before pocketing most

00:30:29.129 --> 00:30:29.849
of the settlement.

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:30.730
I know.

00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:33.609
Hospital visit?

00:30:35.849 --> 00:30:37.369
But I didn't meet or speak

00:30:37.369 --> 00:30:38.529
with Zhu Zhisheng's mother

00:30:38.529 --> 00:30:40.089
or any other relatives.

00:30:41.609 --> 00:30:42.809
That ambulance chaser issue.

00:30:42.809 --> 00:30:44.529
I'll discuss it with Yiaiwan.

00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:46.730
But I should warn you.

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:48.410
After years in law,

00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:50.170
you see humanity's extremes.

00:30:50.849 --> 00:30:51.890
Drive is good,

00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:54.650
but protect yourself first.

00:30:56.049 --> 00:30:56.609
Understood.

00:30:57.289 --> 00:30:57.896
Also,

00:30:58.529 --> 00:31:00.329
I accidentally saw

00:31:00.329 --> 00:31:03.089
sedative sleeping pills
by Zhu Zhisheng's bedside.

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:04.490
So

00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:06.529
his coma is probably related to that.

00:31:08.289 --> 00:31:09.769
So now Zhu Zhisheng's coma

00:31:09.769 --> 00:31:11.769
probably has nothing
to do with Yiaiwan, right?

00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:12.890
The medicine

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:15.369
is at most a possible
contributing factor to the coma.

00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:17.010
But what if he drank too?

00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:18.529
Drinking?

00:31:23.144 --> 00:31:26.289
(Yan Fei
to Ren Jiatong)

00:31:26.289 --> 00:31:26.952
Mr. Zhou.

00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:29.930
Will Yiaiwan still compensate him?

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:31.970
What's your point?

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:35.170
This might not be
a direct workplace injury,

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:37.490
but we checked his clock-ins.

00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:39.569
He was grinding overtime constantly.

00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:40.609
Moreover,

00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:42.089
those pills

00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:44.650
were likely due to work stress.

00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:47.089
Giving zero compensation

00:31:47.089 --> 00:31:49.170
would be brutal for young employees.

00:31:55.129 --> 00:31:55.816
I'm sorry.

00:31:58.129 --> 00:31:59.210
I shouldn't have said that.

00:32:01.809 --> 00:32:02.410
No apologies.

00:32:03.369 --> 00:32:04.210
Emotionally,

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:05.490
I understand your words.

00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:08.890
And I appreciate your passion.

00:32:09.529 --> 00:32:10.089
But,

00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:12.289
this isn't the right occasion

00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:13.890
nor the right time for those words.

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:15.016
Understood?

00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:16.769
Understood.

00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:19.289
I won't say such things

00:32:19.289 --> 00:32:20.450
in professional settings.

00:32:22.289 --> 00:32:24.129
I'll go to that bartender again

00:32:24.129 --> 00:32:24.809
to find out more

00:32:24.809 --> 00:32:26.289
about Zhu Zhisheng's medication.

00:32:27.809 --> 00:32:28.329
I'll go too.

00:32:35.049 --> 00:32:36.049
Those words...

00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:38.250
Even if you care about Guo Xiaoyu,

00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:40.010
you wouldn't voice it professionally.

00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:40.648
Right?

00:32:40.849 --> 00:32:41.650
What's with you?

00:32:47.304 --> 00:32:49.512
(Emergency)

00:32:52.648 --> 00:32:54.344
(Esazolam Tablets:
Sedative, sleeping pills.)

00:32:54.344 --> 00:32:55.816
(Primarily used to treat
anxiety and insomnia)

00:32:55.816 --> 00:32:57.192
(and also tension, fear,
epilepsy and seizures.)

00:33:01.569 --> 00:33:03.809
I was remembering someone
and something from the past.

00:33:05.849 --> 00:33:07.289
I knew someone who,

00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:10.250
during stressful times, couldn't sleep

00:33:11.609 --> 00:33:12.730
and took similar medication.

00:33:22.329 --> 00:33:23.369
How did you discover

00:33:23.369 --> 00:33:25.010
Zhu Zhisheng drank before collapsing?

00:33:25.529 --> 00:33:26.690
Though I quit drinking,

00:33:26.730 --> 00:33:28.529
I'm still highly sensitive to alcohol.

00:33:28.930 --> 00:33:31.049
And I have a sommelier license,

00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:32.890
so I connected well with that bartender.

00:33:33.089 --> 00:33:34.730
It was only two days ago,

00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:35.769
during a big party night.

00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:36.849
Hard to forget easily.

00:33:37.369 --> 00:33:39.329
Why didn't you tell me
during our call last night?

00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:42.210
You didn't mention
anything to me either.

00:33:46.609 --> 00:33:47.970
I didn't tell you because...

00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:53.329
I'm not using this to compete

00:33:53.329 --> 00:33:54.210
against you.

00:33:58.569 --> 00:33:59.289
But I am.

00:34:02.769 --> 00:34:04.289
Since the moment I came to Hangzhou.

00:34:15.370 --> 00:34:16.729
I want to win. I won't deny it.

00:34:16.810 --> 00:34:18.970
But exposing the scumbag
who hurt my friend

00:34:18.970 --> 00:34:20.450
matters just as much to me.

00:34:20.890 --> 00:34:22.169
If Zhu doesn't get compensated,

00:34:22.169 --> 00:34:23.169
he deserves it.

00:34:23.609 --> 00:34:24.569
This isn't about you.

00:34:24.609 --> 00:34:26.729
He hurt Guo Xiaoyu first.

00:34:27.049 --> 00:34:27.609
I won't allow

00:34:27.609 --> 00:34:29.249
my friend to feel torn in the middle

00:34:29.249 --> 00:34:30.890
after being betrayed.

00:34:31.689 --> 00:34:33.330
Once I show her proof

00:34:33.330 --> 00:34:34.089
of his infidelity,

00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:35.290
she won't be conflicted.

00:34:35.649 --> 00:34:36.729
How can she handle that?

00:34:36.810 --> 00:34:38.569
Telling her now will devastate her.

00:34:38.649 --> 00:34:39.810
But even if it's painful,

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:40.810
it's temporary.

00:34:40.810 --> 00:34:42.850
Better than her naively
going to the hospital daily,

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:44.569
spending money and energy.

00:34:45.089 --> 00:34:47.010
After we settle Zhu Zhisheng's matter,

00:34:47.169 --> 00:34:48.249
we'll take her back.

00:34:49.089 --> 00:34:51.089
But we can't decide for Guo Xiaoyu

00:34:51.089 --> 00:34:52.529
which pain cuts deeper.

00:34:52.609 --> 00:34:53.450
We aren't her.

00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:56.209
Don't you know
how desperately she wants him

00:34:56.209 --> 00:34:57.209
to wake up?

00:34:57.609 --> 00:34:59.890
You're being contradictory.

00:35:00.049 --> 00:35:01.410
Which side are you even on?

00:35:01.689 --> 00:35:03.890
You uncovered
Zhu Zhisheng's sedative use.

00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:05.609
I found evidence of his drinking.

00:35:05.890 --> 00:35:07.529
We were cooperating well.

00:35:08.089 --> 00:35:09.649
You think I'm harming Guo Xiaoyu.

00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:10.330
And you?

00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:19.010
Xiaoyu.

00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:24.010
Why?

00:35:27.129 --> 00:35:27.720
Jiatong.

00:35:29.089 --> 00:35:30.609
You came to the hospital yesterday.

00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:34.169
Was it to see me or gather evidence?

00:35:36.569 --> 00:35:37.770
You saw it yesterday.

00:35:38.129 --> 00:35:39.169
He's suffering.

00:35:39.490 --> 00:35:40.490
And Ms. Wang,

00:35:40.810 --> 00:35:42.930
who raised her son
alone through hardship.

00:35:43.249 --> 00:35:44.970
Now, her only child is in a coma.

00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:46.330
Yiaiwan offers no response.

00:35:46.609 --> 00:35:48.370
For days, only a department lead visited

00:35:48.370 --> 00:35:50.129
and stayed for just 15 minutes.

00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:52.010
She wants an explanation.

00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:53.049
What's wrong with that?

00:35:53.370 --> 00:35:54.850
Why push them further?

00:35:57.930 --> 00:35:58.649
Guo Xiaoyu.

00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:01.209
Zhu Zhisheng did cheat.

00:36:02.410 --> 00:36:03.209
If you doubt it,

00:36:03.689 --> 00:36:04.689
we both have proof.

00:36:07.930 --> 00:36:08.569
You two

00:36:10.169 --> 00:36:10.770
knew all along?

00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:16.330
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

00:36:16.970 --> 00:36:18.410
Now that you know the truth,

00:36:18.649 --> 00:36:20.010
stop letting them deceive you.

00:36:23.209 --> 00:36:24.810
Yan Fei, I know you mean well.

00:36:26.890 --> 00:36:29.450
I don't want
to hold you back from your work.

00:36:30.169 --> 00:36:31.850
But now, Zhubao and Ms. Wang

00:36:31.850 --> 00:36:33.330
are completely cornered.

00:36:34.689 --> 00:36:36.450
Guo Xiaoyu, get a grip.

00:36:36.569 --> 00:36:39.129
He cheated first and hurt you.

00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:41.569
I despise these kinds
of scumbags more than anything.

00:36:42.010 --> 00:36:43.330
Besides, this is the truth.

00:36:43.569 --> 00:36:45.209
We haven't wrongfully accused him.

00:36:45.490 --> 00:36:47.850
Did this relationship
scramble your brain?

00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:49.209
This relationship

00:36:49.209 --> 00:36:51.049
lost its meaning

00:36:51.249 --> 00:36:52.450
the moment he cheated.

00:36:58.290 --> 00:36:59.850
After the hurt of betrayal,

00:37:00.689 --> 00:37:02.169
a relationship loses all meaning.

00:37:03.129 --> 00:37:04.010
What about us then?

00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:13.770
I snuck home this morning
while my parents were at work

00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:16.370
to cook this for you two.

00:37:27.649 --> 00:37:29.529
You both came all the way
to Hangzhou for me.

00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:32.370
That warms my heart deeply.

00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:34.290
But I also feel incredibly sorry.

00:37:36.850 --> 00:37:37.370
Jiatong.

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:40.810
What I told you last night

00:37:41.689 --> 00:37:43.010
came straight from my heart.

00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:47.649
I truly see you both as my sisters.

00:37:51.089 --> 00:37:51.810
Xiaoyu.

00:37:57.810 --> 00:37:58.450
Xiaoyu.

00:37:58.770 --> 00:37:59.689
Xiaoyu, wait up.

00:38:04.616 --> 00:38:05.448
(Zhu Zhisheng's Collapse Claim)
Xiaoyu

00:38:05.770 --> 00:38:07.290
(Mrs. Zhu says Guo Xiaoyu shared company info.)
Yiaiwan's legal department

00:38:07.290 --> 00:38:09.529
received documents
from Zhu Zhisheng's mother.

00:38:09.609 --> 00:38:10.689
She says you told her

00:38:10.689 --> 00:38:12.010
about Yiaiwan's upcoming IPO.

00:38:12.609 --> 00:38:14.049
It's probably that ambulance chaser.

00:38:14.410 --> 00:38:16.330
He might have told Zhu's mother

00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:17.330
to frame you.

00:38:17.529 --> 00:38:18.970
Ms. Wang wouldn't say that.

00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:20.770
Could there be a misunderstanding?

00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:28.290
She also claims

00:38:28.290 --> 00:38:30.049
Jun An sent Zhu Zhisheng's girlfriend

00:38:30.049 --> 00:38:31.490
to negotiate with her

00:38:31.609 --> 00:38:32.689
to cover up

00:38:32.689 --> 00:38:34.689
Yiaiwan's forcing overtime
on Zhu Zhisheng

00:38:34.689 --> 00:38:35.569
to avoid paying.

00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:36.890
Ms. Wang,

00:38:37.609 --> 00:38:38.890
if Zhu Zhisheng's case

00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:40.569
is recognized as a work injury,

00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:43.010
he can claim workers' compensation.

00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:50.529
They sent over dashcam footage
and this photo.

00:39:01.384 --> 00:39:03.848
(Let's have a call
after your meeting, Ren Jiatong.)

00:39:04.410 --> 00:39:06.169
The calmer Ms. Bai sounds,

00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:07.330
the scarier.

00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:09.209
Ms. Bai is worried about you two.

00:39:10.089 --> 00:39:11.529
During our online meeting,

00:39:11.569 --> 00:39:12.490
she told Mr. Zhuang

00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:13.689
Guo Xiaoyu was unaware then.

00:39:14.089 --> 00:39:15.850
Her legal advice in the car was given

00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:17.209
before our meeting started.

00:39:17.649 --> 00:39:19.569
It was just general legal counsel,

00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:21.049
not reflecting Jun An.

00:39:21.649 --> 00:39:22.810
Mr. Song also defended you,

00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:24.370
saying you reported the conflict

00:39:24.649 --> 00:39:25.450
and stayed clear.

00:39:25.770 --> 00:39:27.410
But I never reported to Mr. Song.

00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:28.609
You reported to me,

00:39:28.890 --> 00:39:29.770
and I told Mr. Song.

00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:32.290
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:34.970
I was overwhelmed that day.

00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:37.049
Your timely reminder saved me.

00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:38.600
Mr. Zhou,

00:39:39.209 --> 00:39:41.249
is this photo the biggest headache?

00:39:43.249 --> 00:39:46.209
But we've never discussed
this matter with Zhu Zhisheng's mother.

00:39:47.010 --> 00:39:48.010
I believe you.

00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:51.010
But photos can
be interpreted too broadly.

00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:52.930
Prepare yourselves mentally

00:39:53.490 --> 00:39:54.370
for potential trouble.

00:39:58.649 --> 00:39:59.810
I'll talk to Ms. Wang.

00:40:00.129 --> 00:40:01.290
She did this because she felt

00:40:01.290 --> 00:40:01.850
cornered.

00:40:01.850 --> 00:40:02.770
She's not a bad person.

00:40:03.169 --> 00:40:04.330
And you still trust her?

00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:05.450
If you go,

00:40:05.450 --> 00:40:07.129
what if she records you again?

00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:10.984
Mr. Zhou,

00:40:11.209 --> 00:40:12.490
let's go to the hospital

00:40:12.529 --> 00:40:13.930
and talk to Zhu's mother.

00:40:20.330 --> 00:40:22.450
If Guo Xiaoyu had known
about Zhu's cheating earlier

00:40:22.450 --> 00:40:23.129
and dumped him,

00:40:23.209 --> 00:40:25.049
she and Ren Jiatong
wouldn't be in this mess.

00:40:25.649 --> 00:40:26.290
Are you alright?

00:40:27.089 --> 00:40:27.810
Perfectly fine.

00:40:28.169 --> 00:40:29.729
Zhu Zhisheng means nothing to me.

00:40:29.729 --> 00:40:32.089
I just genuinely hate scumbags like him.

00:40:32.689 --> 00:40:33.930
So you take boxing lessons

00:40:34.169 --> 00:40:35.450
to beat up scumbags.

00:40:35.609 --> 00:40:37.490
Yes, I want to take down
every single one I see.

00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:39.410
I sense your killer vibe.

00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:40.850
No need to be scared.

00:40:41.169 --> 00:40:42.689
You're such a rare gem of a man.

00:40:42.689 --> 00:40:43.649
And a lawyer.

00:40:43.649 --> 00:40:45.930
Seriously, this might be
the world's ninth wonder.

00:40:46.129 --> 00:40:46.850
A good man.

00:40:47.290 --> 00:40:47.912
Me?

00:40:54.089 --> 00:40:54.609
Ms. Wang.

00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:56.330
We're lawyers from Jun An.

00:40:56.569 --> 00:40:57.410
Here to see him.

00:41:00.169 --> 00:41:01.770
I've already sent my demands to you.

00:41:02.370 --> 00:41:03.209
Unless you agree

00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:04.456
to pay,

00:41:04.569 --> 00:41:05.410
don't come back.

00:41:06.609 --> 00:41:07.209
Ms. Wang.

00:41:08.209 --> 00:41:09.330
Xiaoyu worries about you.

00:41:13.101 --> 00:41:14.529
The diagnosis is out.

00:41:14.529 --> 00:41:16.129
Cerebral hemorrhage caused by impact.

00:41:16.129 --> 00:41:17.850
Yiaiwan owes me an explanation.

00:41:18.984 --> 00:41:21.032
He collapsed at the office
after working overtime.

00:41:21.032 --> 00:41:22.504
He's been unconscious.

00:41:22.504 --> 00:41:25.224
What if his medical bills exceed

00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:27.010
insurance coverage later?

00:41:27.850 --> 00:41:29.209
My son's current situation

00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:31.370
is entirely Yiaiwan's fault.

00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:53.129
Sorry, Ms. Bai.

00:41:53.209 --> 00:41:54.529
This was all my negligence.

00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:56.490
It won't happen again.

00:42:05.249 --> 00:42:05.896
Okay.

00:42:06.089 --> 00:42:06.970
Understood, Ms. Bai.

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:16.360
(Jiang Chen
to Ren Jiatong)

00:42:18.089 --> 00:42:18.729
Jiatong.

00:42:26.850 --> 00:42:27.450
What's wrong?

00:42:27.729 --> 00:42:28.890
I'm sorry.

00:42:31.290 --> 00:42:33.089
Huang Yue just told me everything.

00:42:34.049 --> 00:42:35.890
Jiang Chen said you hesitated for ages.

00:42:36.609 --> 00:42:38.649
Then Ms. Wang pressured you.

00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:40.689
You worried it would affect me,

00:42:41.049 --> 00:42:42.770
so you handed over the evidence.

00:42:43.689 --> 00:42:45.010
I misunderstood you before.

00:42:45.609 --> 00:42:46.249
I'm sorry.

00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:48.810
I'm not mad at you.

00:42:49.729 --> 00:42:51.049
My fault for not telling you.

00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:55.290
Actually, his mother knew too.

00:42:55.450 --> 00:42:56.649
She just kept it from us.

00:42:57.290 --> 00:42:58.290
It's probably my mistake.

00:42:58.850 --> 00:43:00.609
If I hadn't called you to the hospital,

00:43:00.850 --> 00:43:02.370
none of this would've happened.

00:43:03.089 --> 00:43:04.410
And you wouldn't be involved.

00:43:06.049 --> 00:43:07.129
Aren't you two hungry?

00:43:08.089 --> 00:43:09.209
If you keep apologizing,

00:43:09.209 --> 00:43:10.169
the food will get cold.

00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:17.000
(Work Injury Ascertainment)

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.440
(Answer: It is
the labor authority's official process)

00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:19.944
(to determine if an employee's injury
or disease qualifies as work-related.)

00:43:19.944 --> 00:43:21.544
(This is key to protecting
work-injured employees' rights.)

00:43:21.544 --> 00:43:23.272
(Workers should understand
the criteria, deadlines and procedures.)

00:43:23.272 --> 00:43:24.840
(Remember to preserve evidence.)

00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:26.600
(If employers don't file
after workplace injuries,)

00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:28.072
(workers must promptly apply
to protect their rights.)
