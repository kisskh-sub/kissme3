00:00:46.651 --> 00:00:50.071
Ms. Mo, what did you just say?

00:00:51.531 --> 00:00:53.825
I'm confessing that…

00:00:57.078 --> 00:00:58.580
I killed another person.

00:01:06.504 --> 00:01:12.552
I'll confess when, where, who, and how.

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:17.390
I'll confess in court,
where I'll be judged.

00:01:18.391 --> 00:01:22.437
The judge won't be able to dismiss it
under the sacred authority of the court,

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.317
and the jury will gladly serve
as witnesses to what they hear firsthand.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.448
The press will be all over it,
eager for a major scoop.

00:01:35.074 --> 00:01:36.951
Whether people believe it doesn't matter.

00:01:37.035 --> 00:01:40.371
What's important
is how much interest it piques.

00:01:41.873 --> 00:01:44.417
The reason people didn't believe you

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.836
was because

00:01:48.254 --> 00:01:51.090
your truth wasn't interesting enough.

00:01:54.427 --> 00:01:57.555
But why should I trust you at all?

00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:01.726
Why would you?

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.020
You don't even know me.

00:02:05.271 --> 00:02:06.314
You shouldn't trust me

00:02:07.857 --> 00:02:10.109
but rather your own desperation.

00:02:11.027 --> 00:02:13.655
The only truth in our deal

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.075
is your desperation.

00:02:18.785 --> 00:02:22.413
The defendant, Mo, being tried
for the Dentist Couple Murder case,

00:02:22.497 --> 00:02:24.791
confessed to another murder
mid-trial in court.

00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:26.876
Only Mo remained calm

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.046
in the shocked courtroom
as she continued her confession.

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.299
Meanwhile, the authorities
said nothing has been confirmed yet

00:02:33.383 --> 00:02:38.054
and urged the media to refrain
from excessive speculation.

00:02:38.137 --> 00:02:40.139
However, the public is questioning

00:02:40.223 --> 00:02:43.851
whether the interrogation
of the teacher was excessive.

00:02:43.935 --> 00:02:48.606
It's the authorities' intention to uncover
all the facts through further inquiry.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.193
Due to the unprecedented act
of confessing to another murder in court,

00:02:52.277 --> 00:02:54.320
the court was unable to reach a verdict,

00:02:54.404 --> 00:02:57.907
and the trial was postponed indefinitely.

00:02:57.991 --> 00:03:03.079
Mo, dubbed "the witch of the century,"
was transferred back to prison.

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:08.960
If Mo's confession turns out to be true,

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:11.379
the authorities will face criticism,

00:03:11.462 --> 00:03:15.925
not only for failing to protect
a grieving widow in despair,

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:19.262
but also for branding her
as her husband's killer.

00:03:19.345 --> 00:03:21.556
Hey, it really wasn't you?

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:23.725
Fuck, looks like it really wasn't.

00:03:24.225 --> 00:03:26.978
Holy shit, what a fucked-up life you have.

00:03:27.061 --> 00:03:30.356
Fucking hell.
Those bastard prosecutors. Fuck.

00:03:30.857 --> 00:03:33.234
PROSECUTION'S BLUNDER EXPOSED
INVESTIGATION PROCESS QUESTIONED

00:03:33.318 --> 00:03:35.987
How did nobody notice anything
before things got to this point?!

00:03:37.947 --> 00:03:39.032
You,

00:03:39.574 --> 00:03:42.368
an inept prosecutor
who couldn't uncover her other crime.

00:03:42.452 --> 00:03:43.494
And you,

00:03:45.163 --> 00:03:49.250
a coercive prosecutor who excessively
investigated a widow. For fuck's sake.

00:03:49.334 --> 00:03:53.046
But she's a psychopath.

00:03:54.047 --> 00:03:56.674
She used to roam free,
but now she's locked up.

00:03:57.925 --> 00:04:00.094
She just wants attention, sir.

00:04:03.264 --> 00:04:04.474
Can you own what you said?

00:04:06.184 --> 00:04:09.228
If you can't make things right,
will you step down?

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:14.650
Get out, you punk.

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:17.820
Get the hell out!

00:04:25.411 --> 00:04:27.038
Where do you think you're going?

00:04:29.415 --> 00:04:30.750
What's your take?

00:04:34.587 --> 00:04:36.130
An Yun-su is the real killer.

00:04:38.216 --> 00:04:40.927
You're confident in your legwork.
Is that it?

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.095
What about the witch?

00:04:43.304 --> 00:04:45.640
We'll have to find out
why she's putting on a show.

00:04:45.723 --> 00:04:46.641
A show?

00:04:47.475 --> 00:04:49.936
It's a show
she was so ready to put on in court.

00:04:50.436 --> 00:04:51.562
If things go wrong,

00:04:51.646 --> 00:04:55.650
you might end up on the sidelines
for the rest of your career.

00:04:57.193 --> 00:04:59.153
If it comes to that,
I'll step down myself.

00:05:02.073 --> 00:05:03.950
Inmate 407, time to move.

00:05:36.357 --> 00:05:37.733
-Get going.
-Get moving.

00:06:22.612 --> 00:06:25.490
So she's the one
who got locked up instead of me.

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:27.617
No talking.

00:06:29.076 --> 00:06:31.787
I'm sorry about that. That's on me.

00:06:32.413 --> 00:06:34.081
I said no talking.

00:06:35.374 --> 00:06:37.835
You'll be going home soon.

00:06:41.297 --> 00:06:43.049
Inmate 407, face the front.

00:06:46.761 --> 00:06:48.221
Inmate 407.

00:06:48.763 --> 00:06:49.889
Open your mouth again--

00:06:49.972 --> 00:06:54.185
To be honest, your husband
wasn't bad enough to deserve to die.

00:06:54.268 --> 00:06:55.102
Hey, 407!

00:06:55.186 --> 00:06:56.187
Maybe

00:06:57.522 --> 00:07:00.191
he just got unlucky, you know?

00:07:00.274 --> 00:07:01.651
Inmate 407, keep quiet!

00:07:04.237 --> 00:07:05.905
2784, get off her!

00:07:07.615 --> 00:07:08.616
Get her!

00:07:10.451 --> 00:07:11.452
Break it up!

00:07:41.232 --> 00:07:42.275
Get her!

00:07:42.358 --> 00:07:44.026
See? Look at her!

00:07:45.194 --> 00:07:48.155
She was literally about to rip her apart.

00:07:48.239 --> 00:07:53.744
If the guards hadn't stepped in,
that witch probably would've lost an ear.

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:55.454
Get her!

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:27.570
You're smaller than I thought.

00:08:38.164 --> 00:08:39.582
Thank you.

00:08:46.088 --> 00:08:49.508
You're here today as a person of interest
in the spousal murder case.

00:08:49.592 --> 00:08:52.887
For a person of interest,
it's customary not to have an attorney,

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:54.180
but if you want--

00:08:54.263 --> 00:08:55.389
My attorney

00:08:56.891 --> 00:08:58.142
ran off.

00:08:59.769 --> 00:09:00.686
Exactly.

00:09:01.354 --> 00:09:02.730
That's why I'm asking.

00:09:03.689 --> 00:09:05.816
Can you give a statement
without an attorney?

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:08.819
I confessed in court.

00:09:10.279 --> 00:09:12.490
Why would I refuse to talk now?

00:09:16.952 --> 00:09:20.039
You gave me a fright earlier, you know.

00:09:20.122 --> 00:09:22.667
You suddenly went after her
and started biting.

00:09:23.167 --> 00:09:25.211
I thought things were about to get ugly.

00:09:28.673 --> 00:09:31.926
Okay, then. Where should we start?

00:09:38.766 --> 00:09:40.976
I won't say anything
until I get an attorney.

00:09:43.104 --> 00:09:44.105
I see.

00:09:46.232 --> 00:09:48.943
We'll just be going over
a few quick things today.

00:09:49.026 --> 00:09:50.903
-So--
-I refuse to make a statement.

00:09:53.406 --> 00:09:56.200
She's become a statue all of a sudden.

00:09:56.283 --> 00:09:59.370
She didn't respond
when I asked if she wanted a drink.

00:09:59.453 --> 00:10:01.539
She's reluctant to be near us,
let alone talk.

00:10:02.581 --> 00:10:03.999
What should we do?

00:10:04.083 --> 00:10:05.084
Hey.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.461
Why don't you go and talk to…

00:10:12.174 --> 00:10:13.217
You go in there.

00:10:14.635 --> 00:10:15.636
Just let her be.

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:19.348
She's not my priority today.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:23.394
She is.

00:10:39.076 --> 00:10:40.453
Shall we?

00:10:43.164 --> 00:10:46.667
Tell me how An Yun-su's husband,
Lee Ki-Dae, was killed

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:52.047
and everything you remember
before and after the murder.

00:10:55.301 --> 00:10:56.469
Everything…

00:11:07.354 --> 00:11:09.315
It looked like

00:11:09.815 --> 00:11:12.067
they'd remodeled an old paint shop.

00:11:13.444 --> 00:11:16.489
I went up the steps outside the building

00:11:17.323 --> 00:11:18.991
and came to a big door.

00:11:20.743 --> 00:11:23.287
I walked a few steps down the hallway

00:11:24.872 --> 00:11:26.957
and found another door.

00:11:28.709 --> 00:11:30.711
It was ajar.

00:11:55.486 --> 00:11:57.696
So did you go up to him

00:11:58.489 --> 00:11:59.698
and stab him right away?

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:03.202
The stabbing came later.

00:12:04.161 --> 00:12:06.622
I hit him over the head
with a wine bottle.

00:12:07.581 --> 00:12:10.709
It was a given
that he'd be stronger than me,

00:12:10.793 --> 00:12:14.046
so I thought I could end up hurt
if I didn't stab right.

00:12:15.548 --> 00:12:16.382
And then?

00:12:16.966 --> 00:12:20.052
His legs must've given way
because he dropped to the floor.

00:12:21.053 --> 00:12:22.888
I had worried about how tall he was.

00:12:22.972 --> 00:12:26.600
But when he went down,
his neck was within reach to stab easily.

00:12:27.351 --> 00:12:29.812
I actually had a scalpel in my bag,

00:12:29.895 --> 00:12:33.232
but the place was full of things
I could kill with.

00:12:34.567 --> 00:12:35.860
So I just

00:12:36.485 --> 00:12:38.612
grabbed the first carving knife I saw.

00:12:42.241 --> 00:12:44.076
-Let's turn it around.
-Shall I turn it?

00:12:46.036 --> 00:12:49.707
And as I looked straight at the man
on his knees,

00:12:50.791 --> 00:12:52.167
I stabbed him in the neck.

00:13:01.552 --> 00:13:02.553
How many times?

00:13:02.636 --> 00:13:04.221
Face the mannequin,

00:13:04.722 --> 00:13:06.223
and stab it six times.

00:13:10.185 --> 00:13:11.020
One,

00:13:12.146 --> 00:13:13.147
two,

00:13:15.024 --> 00:13:16.191
three, four…

00:13:18.402 --> 00:13:19.236
six.

00:13:20.237 --> 00:13:21.238
I think?

00:13:26.952 --> 00:13:28.454
And then? Go on.

00:13:30.247 --> 00:13:34.251
It wasn't like I could wipe away
every trace I had left behind.

00:13:34.335 --> 00:13:35.878
There was no time either.

00:13:35.961 --> 00:13:38.672
I saw the table set up for wine

00:13:38.756 --> 00:13:41.592
and knew someone would come soon.

00:13:42.176 --> 00:13:45.471
And you covered your tracks and left?

00:13:45.554 --> 00:13:47.765
I messed around a bit before leaving.

00:13:48.515 --> 00:13:53.145
I threw a different carving knife
from the worktable next to the body.

00:14:04.531 --> 00:14:06.533
And the carving knife used as a weapon?

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.750
I put it back

00:14:15.584 --> 00:14:17.211
exactly where I found it.

00:14:18.796 --> 00:14:20.923
It was still pouring down.

00:14:21.924 --> 00:14:23.634
As I hurried outside,

00:14:24.134 --> 00:14:26.929
I noticed a car that wasn't there before.

00:14:40.192 --> 00:14:41.860
"Is someone in there?"

00:14:43.904 --> 00:14:45.155
"Should I kill them too?"

00:14:46.699 --> 00:14:49.243
I started walking toward the car
but stopped.

00:14:50.995 --> 00:14:52.663
"But what if it's a big guy?"

00:14:54.123 --> 00:14:56.083
"What if there's more than one?"

00:14:57.167 --> 00:14:59.795
It was dark and raining.

00:15:00.295 --> 00:15:02.131
I had a mask on.

00:15:03.007 --> 00:15:07.302
I figured they wouldn't have seen my face,
so I just turned back and left.

00:15:11.473 --> 00:15:14.476
Can you draw the inside of the studio?

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:22.067
I'm not very good at drawing though.

00:16:11.825 --> 00:16:14.036
I just remembered something.

00:16:14.953 --> 00:16:16.747
There was a tattoo

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:19.291
on the dead man's neck.

00:16:20.584 --> 00:16:21.710
What kind of tattoo?

00:16:23.128 --> 00:16:24.963
It looked like someone's face.

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:31.345
It's been more than five months,

00:16:32.054 --> 00:16:35.015
and you still seem to remember
every single detail.

00:16:39.186 --> 00:16:41.480
I've always had a sharp mind.

00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:47.694
Once I see something,
I can never forget it.

00:17:12.553 --> 00:17:14.888
Was it ever revealed
where the carving knife was?

00:17:16.014 --> 00:17:16.849
No, sir.

00:17:17.808 --> 00:17:19.977
What about the tattoo
or the studio's layout?

00:17:21.228 --> 00:17:22.062
No, sir.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.567
You were supposed to find holes
in her story,

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:30.279
but instead, you just helped that psycho
prove she was at the scene.

00:17:43.709 --> 00:17:47.337
Chief, do you remember the color
of Investigator Hwang's tie?

00:17:47.838 --> 00:17:49.381
What are you getting at?

00:18:02.019 --> 00:18:03.061
Is it blue?

00:18:07.357 --> 00:18:09.610
I was in a rush this morning.

00:18:10.611 --> 00:18:11.445
That woman

00:18:12.863 --> 00:18:15.574
even remembered the furniture layout
from five months ago.

00:18:16.074 --> 00:18:18.118
Everything she said was too precise,

00:18:18.744 --> 00:18:20.954
as if she was reciting
lines she'd memorized.

00:18:22.873 --> 00:18:25.375
And not once did she mention her motive.

00:18:26.168 --> 00:18:27.169
You know how it is.

00:18:27.794 --> 00:18:30.797
With murder cases,
they first tell us why they did it.

00:18:30.881 --> 00:18:32.299
She's a psychopath.

00:18:32.925 --> 00:18:34.009
Does she need a reason?

00:18:34.092 --> 00:18:36.053
Even more so for psychopaths.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.680
Reasons like why someone becomes a target

00:18:39.181 --> 00:18:41.308
and why they had to die

00:18:41.934 --> 00:18:45.312
all serve as justification
and a form of showing off.

00:18:45.812 --> 00:18:50.817
I'm sure you know, but your mom and dad
weren't exactly good people.

00:18:51.318 --> 00:18:53.362
Blame your parents.

00:18:54.363 --> 00:18:55.822
Why did you let it slide?

00:18:56.573 --> 00:18:57.783
You should've grilled her.

00:19:00.911 --> 00:19:03.121
There was no way of knowing if she lied.

00:19:04.998 --> 00:19:06.458
Well, actually,

00:19:07.834 --> 00:19:10.545
the detention center
just sent us some records.

00:19:11.129 --> 00:19:15.384
They say An Yun-su and Mo Eun
were put in solitary at the same time.

00:19:15.467 --> 00:19:16.802
Right next to each other.

00:19:20.389 --> 00:19:23.016
Could you please make a call
to the judge for a warrant?

00:19:34.027 --> 00:19:35.404
Please hand in your phones.

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:42.035
I didn't know
you'd turn up at the crack of dawn.

00:19:42.119 --> 00:19:43.078
You have a warrant?

00:19:45.539 --> 00:19:46.373
Here.

00:19:49.668 --> 00:19:51.461
Please come in. Let them through.

00:20:04.308 --> 00:20:05.309
We're going in.

00:20:06.143 --> 00:20:07.144
Get them ready.

00:20:08.353 --> 00:20:12.149
Dear Lord, I pray you give me strength
to get through this ordeal.

00:20:13.442 --> 00:20:14.735
I'm so tired.

00:20:17.529 --> 00:20:18.530
This is it.

00:20:22.492 --> 00:20:24.119
By design, you can't communicate.

00:20:24.202 --> 00:20:26.788
They have to raise their voices
to be heard.

00:20:26.872 --> 00:20:28.790
But then we'd hear them over there.

00:20:36.548 --> 00:20:40.510
What if you dozed off or left your post?

00:20:41.845 --> 00:20:45.474
CCTV surveillance is not only for inmates.

00:20:46.183 --> 00:20:48.060
Staff are also monitored for conduct.

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:50.103
Particularly for solitary,

00:20:50.187 --> 00:20:53.482
each cell gets checked every half an hour
in case anything happens.

00:20:53.565 --> 00:20:55.484
A word or two might've gone unnoticed.

00:20:55.984 --> 00:21:00.113
But we couldn't possibly have missed them
scheming like that.

00:21:16.254 --> 00:21:17.547
You can go ahead.

00:21:18.173 --> 00:21:19.174
Yes, sir.

00:21:23.178 --> 00:21:25.680
Sim, if you can hear me…

00:21:30.102 --> 00:21:31.019
Hello?

00:21:32.521 --> 00:21:33.939
Can you hear me or not?

00:21:36.108 --> 00:21:38.318
Sim, can you hear me?

00:21:39.861 --> 00:21:41.738
Answer me if you can, even a little bit.

00:21:42.906 --> 00:21:43.740
Hello?

00:21:44.783 --> 00:21:47.202
You said you'd work late yesterday,
but you bailed.

00:21:48.036 --> 00:21:51.331
Recently, you took a half-day's leave
to see a doctor but went fishing.

00:21:51.415 --> 00:21:53.041
You even posted it on Instagram!

00:21:53.125 --> 00:21:54.960
I can hear you, sir!

00:21:55.043 --> 00:21:56.920
But last week, you also--

00:21:57.003 --> 00:21:58.713
I hear you loud and clear!

00:21:58.797 --> 00:21:59.881
Mr. Baek!

00:22:00.382 --> 00:22:04.719
Mr. Baek, we can hear each other in here.
Can you hear us from outside?

00:22:07.472 --> 00:22:09.474
Yes, we can. Please come out.

00:22:10.725 --> 00:22:11.560
Hey.

00:22:12.936 --> 00:22:14.271
From my cell,

00:22:14.354 --> 00:22:17.357
you can hear the next cell just fine
without all the yelling.

00:22:17.858 --> 00:22:21.736
I wake up every day
at the sound of this woman praying.

00:22:22.237 --> 00:22:24.865
I get that she's asking
for some kind of grace,

00:22:25.365 --> 00:22:26.992
but it sounds cult-like.

00:22:27.075 --> 00:22:29.870
What? What about you?
Every night, you're all…

00:22:30.704 --> 00:22:33.206
-You fucking bitch, I'll--
-Inmate 3216, quiet.

00:22:34.708 --> 00:22:35.542
Which cells?

00:22:37.085 --> 00:22:38.545
Cells 10 and 11.

00:22:40.172 --> 00:22:41.882
Mr. Hwang, move to cell 11.

00:22:43.008 --> 00:22:43.884
Yes, sir.

00:22:53.685 --> 00:22:55.854
Sir, can you hear me?

00:22:58.440 --> 00:22:59.566
You can't, can you?

00:23:01.193 --> 00:23:02.152
Mr. Baek.

00:23:03.778 --> 00:23:05.614
We're working late again, aren't we?

00:23:08.116 --> 00:23:09.910
When I was leaving home for work today,

00:23:09.993 --> 00:23:12.287
my wife said
I might as well just live with you.

00:23:13.288 --> 00:23:14.539
I can hear you, Mr. Hwang.

00:23:14.623 --> 00:23:15.582
What?

00:23:16.917 --> 00:23:17.876
You can hear me?

00:23:19.044 --> 00:23:21.171
Come closer to the wall and say something.

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:24.424
Sir.

00:23:25.592 --> 00:23:29.596
You know my wife was just kidding, right?

00:23:30.889 --> 00:23:31.890
Sir?

00:23:32.891 --> 00:23:35.519
You can hear me, right?
Busy doing something?

00:23:36.228 --> 00:23:38.522
Let me know if you need anything, sir.

00:23:38.605 --> 00:23:40.398
I've got your back.

00:23:40.941 --> 00:23:42.025
Sir?

00:23:43.318 --> 00:23:44.945
Sir, can you hear me?

00:24:19.271 --> 00:24:20.272
Sir.

00:24:20.855 --> 00:24:24.317
I don't think there's anything
out of place in this cell.

00:24:24.401 --> 00:24:25.485
What now?

00:24:26.945 --> 00:24:28.446
We'll check the shared cells.

00:25:00.478 --> 00:25:02.105
Inmate 2784, look away.

00:25:04.441 --> 00:25:05.567
I said look away.

00:25:13.074 --> 00:25:15.243
I request a strip search of the inmates.

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:17.120
Sir.

00:25:17.662 --> 00:25:20.248
That's a violation of their rights.
It may cause problems.

00:25:20.332 --> 00:25:21.708
I'll do the strip search.

00:25:23.877 --> 00:25:26.129
Should I do it here?
So you can see for yourself?

00:25:26.212 --> 00:25:27.380
An Yun-su.

00:25:27.464 --> 00:25:30.925
The search is for all inmates from cell 5,
including An Yun-su.

00:25:32.344 --> 00:25:33.386
That's unauthorized.

00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:35.055
-You can't.
-Ms. Eom.

00:25:35.639 --> 00:25:37.390
I believe it's up to the supervisor.

00:25:37.474 --> 00:25:40.143
That's only applicable
when there's a serious issue.

00:25:40.226 --> 00:25:42.520
You don't consider this serious?

00:25:44.189 --> 00:25:47.108
There are criminals conspiring right here,

00:25:47.609 --> 00:25:50.195
making a mockery
of the Korean judicial system.

00:25:50.695 --> 00:25:51.988
It's not certain yet.

00:25:52.906 --> 00:25:54.407
Get me the warden.

00:25:59.037 --> 00:26:01.122
Fucking unbelievable.

00:26:21.184 --> 00:26:22.143
Take off your underwear.

00:26:22.227 --> 00:26:24.479
-For fuck's sake.
-Jeez.

00:26:24.562 --> 00:26:25.772
Give it a rest, will you?

00:26:25.855 --> 00:26:28.733
What the fuck are we doing
with our boobs out, between us girls?

00:26:28.817 --> 00:26:30.652
-Kim Yeong-sun.
-What?

00:26:30.735 --> 00:26:33.446
-You got four years for assault, right?
-Yeah.

00:26:34.614 --> 00:26:36.366
This could make it five.

00:26:36.449 --> 00:26:37.659
That's not fucking mine.

00:26:37.742 --> 00:26:39.369
I'm looking after it for someone.

00:26:40.578 --> 00:26:41.996
Fucking hell.

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:43.415
Hey, drop 'em.

00:26:43.915 --> 00:26:46.126
Here, look.

00:26:46.209 --> 00:26:48.336
-Goddamn it.
-For fuck's sake.

00:26:48.837 --> 00:26:51.339
Fuck, this is sick.

00:26:52.048 --> 00:26:53.133
Keep your eyes forward.

00:26:53.216 --> 00:26:55.844
I am. Where the fuck else?
They're in front, aren't they?

00:26:55.927 --> 00:26:57.137
Fucking hell.

00:27:13.111 --> 00:27:15.321
You have no right
to treat people like this.

00:27:18.408 --> 00:27:21.453
Well, not all people are the same.

00:27:27.876 --> 00:27:29.210
Do you trust that woman?

00:27:30.211 --> 00:27:31.337
That woman

00:27:31.838 --> 00:27:34.632
is a completely different person from you.

00:27:43.016 --> 00:27:47.353
If the person who killed your husband
was standing right in front of you,

00:27:47.854 --> 00:27:49.773
what would you do?

00:27:51.983 --> 00:27:52.984
I'd kill them.

00:27:54.235 --> 00:27:55.862
Rip them to shreds.

00:27:57.155 --> 00:27:59.073
Chew them to the bone.

00:28:03.536 --> 00:28:05.914
If I confess in court,

00:28:06.414 --> 00:28:09.876
it means I'll be your husband's murderer.

00:28:11.503 --> 00:28:13.171
And we will meet again,

00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:16.382
you and I,

00:28:17.008 --> 00:28:18.676
whether in here or in court.

00:28:22.764 --> 00:28:23.765
When we do,

00:28:25.016 --> 00:28:27.268
come at me like you're going to kill me.

00:28:28.269 --> 00:28:31.231
Like you're going to chew me up.

00:28:32.732 --> 00:28:37.862
That's how I'll know
you've accepted my offer.

00:28:56.297 --> 00:28:58.800
Goddamn it! That was fucking humiliating!

00:28:58.883 --> 00:29:00.760
Those fucking bastards!

00:29:00.844 --> 00:29:02.595
Fucking hell!

00:29:02.679 --> 00:29:06.432
If they fucking mess it up,
they should fucking clean it up!

00:29:06.516 --> 00:29:09.102
Those fucking assholes.
Goddamn it! The motherfuckers.

00:29:09.185 --> 00:29:15.650
Hey, don't you ever fucking let
that son of a bitch prosecutor scare you.

00:29:15.733 --> 00:29:16.985
You hear me?

00:29:17.068 --> 00:29:18.486
Is that prick into you or what?

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:20.363
Why's he like that
with someone who's innocent?

00:29:20.446 --> 00:29:22.115
-Bastards!
-I'm sorry, everyone.

00:29:22.198 --> 00:29:24.534
Fuck. What are you sorry for, you idiot?

00:29:24.617 --> 00:29:27.078
Fucking hell.
Isn't she supposed to be in the clear?

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:41.843
I told her to come at me
like she was going to chew me up.

00:29:44.304 --> 00:29:45.972
She actually chewed on me.

00:30:47.367 --> 00:30:48.242
Mr. Hwang.

00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:51.287
Please request a polygraph test from NFS.

00:30:51.371 --> 00:30:53.081
A lie detector test?

00:30:53.581 --> 00:30:55.625
Will the suspects agree to it?

00:30:55.708 --> 00:30:57.168
An Yun-su won't.

00:30:57.251 --> 00:30:58.795
But Mo Eun will.

00:30:59.295 --> 00:31:01.839
Yes, sir.
By the way, did you hear the news?

00:31:01.923 --> 00:31:04.300
An Yun-su has appointed an attorney.

00:31:04.384 --> 00:31:09.138
Since it's a high-profile case,
even the big-name lawyers showed interest.

00:31:09.222 --> 00:31:12.100
But she went for an unknown lawyer
who isn't anything special.

00:31:16.771 --> 00:31:17.689
Hand that in.

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:23.987
The back pocket too.

00:31:36.582 --> 00:31:38.042
This isn't the first time.

00:31:38.543 --> 00:31:39.836
LAWYER JANG JEONG-GU

00:31:39.919 --> 00:31:41.796
But don't judge a person by their looks.

00:31:43.214 --> 00:31:44.424
Thanks.

00:31:58.396 --> 00:32:02.775
When public opinion starts to change,
get a new lawyer.

00:32:03.359 --> 00:32:04.819
They can't be a big name

00:32:05.653 --> 00:32:07.697
but have to be someone unknown.

00:32:08.197 --> 00:32:13.161
That way, the injustice you suffered
isn't overshadowed by your lawyer's name.

00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:18.249
And if they're unknown,
they'll be ambitious for sure.

00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:19.625
Excuse me.

00:32:20.168 --> 00:32:22.128
Why is she handcuffed?

00:32:22.879 --> 00:32:25.214
Restraints during internal transfers
are banned.

00:32:25.298 --> 00:32:27.216
The prosecution had her marked high-risk.

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:29.052
You take orders from a prosecutor?

00:32:30.261 --> 00:32:32.138
It's against the correctional law.

00:32:33.848 --> 00:32:34.682
Please uncuff her.

00:32:42.398 --> 00:32:44.442
How long do you think you'll take?

00:32:45.234 --> 00:32:48.029
I'm not sure. I have nothing scheduled
after this though.

00:32:50.198 --> 00:32:51.032
Thanks.

00:32:53.201 --> 00:32:54.869
It's nice to meet you.

00:32:55.369 --> 00:32:57.914
-I'm Jang Jeong-gu, your attorney.
-Nice to meet you.

00:32:58.414 --> 00:33:00.124
Please take a seat.

00:33:00.833 --> 00:33:01.667
Thanks.

00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:16.557
Oh, this?

00:33:16.641 --> 00:33:17.767
My nose?

00:33:18.267 --> 00:33:21.938
I did some boxing when I was young
because my father was really into it.

00:33:22.021 --> 00:33:23.272
But I wasn't any good.

00:33:23.356 --> 00:33:24.440
I took so many punches

00:33:24.524 --> 00:33:26.984
that it got flattened
and crooked like this.

00:33:27.068 --> 00:33:29.403
I'm sorry. I was staring, wasn't I?

00:33:29.487 --> 00:33:30.696
It's fine.

00:33:31.197 --> 00:33:33.366
It's actually a nose
that brings good luck.

00:33:36.035 --> 00:33:38.621
Right, then, let's get started.

00:33:41.541 --> 00:33:44.085
I heard human rights were violated
last week

00:33:44.168 --> 00:33:46.420
when the prosecution
demanded a body search.

00:33:46.504 --> 00:33:48.798
Could you tell me about it in detail?

00:33:48.881 --> 00:33:51.175
Can I get out of here before the appeal?

00:33:51.801 --> 00:33:53.845
I heard I could get out on bail.

00:33:55.054 --> 00:33:58.599
We're meant to start with jabs,
but you went straight for the hook.

00:34:01.352 --> 00:34:02.353
Well…

00:34:04.564 --> 00:34:07.942
no murder suspect
has ever been released on bail before.

00:34:08.526 --> 00:34:11.195
-But I have--
-Then again, this case is unprecedented.

00:34:11.696 --> 00:34:13.489
The real killer hasn't owned up before.

00:34:13.573 --> 00:34:16.534
So are you saying it's possible?

00:34:17.702 --> 00:34:19.078
It won't be easy.

00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:23.249
The court and prosecution will be
resistant to admitting their mistakes.

00:34:23.332 --> 00:34:26.377
The prosecution, in particular,
will do anything to stop it.

00:34:26.878 --> 00:34:29.797
If the bail request is denied,

00:34:29.881 --> 00:34:32.091
it will work against you
in the main trial.

00:34:32.884 --> 00:34:34.343
Please get me out of here.

00:34:35.928 --> 00:34:37.513
I have to get out.

00:34:38.514 --> 00:34:40.308
I'll make sure you do

00:34:41.184 --> 00:34:43.227
so you can be reunited with your daughter.

00:34:43.978 --> 00:34:44.812
But to do that,

00:34:45.605 --> 00:34:48.566
you must tell me everything
without holding anything back.

00:34:51.485 --> 00:34:52.486
Okay.

00:34:53.654 --> 00:34:56.949
All right, then.
Shall we start with a few jabs?

00:35:10.671 --> 00:35:13.925
The day's operations will end shortly.

00:35:14.008 --> 00:35:17.762
Attorneys and inmates currently
in consultation, please finish up.

00:35:17.845 --> 00:35:20.640
We'll end here for today.

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:22.725
Make sure you eat well.

00:35:23.226 --> 00:35:24.518
-I will.
-Good.

00:35:25.770 --> 00:35:30.316
I refused to take a lie detector test
the prosecution requested a few days ago.

00:35:30.816 --> 00:35:31.651
I heard.

00:35:31.734 --> 00:35:35.029
It means
they don't have any solid evidence.

00:35:35.112 --> 00:35:37.615
They're hoping to turn things around
using a machine.

00:35:37.698 --> 00:35:39.033
Good call.

00:35:41.244 --> 00:35:42.745
By the way,

00:35:43.704 --> 00:35:45.331
do you know if that woman…

00:35:46.415 --> 00:35:48.000
Yes, she has agreed to take it.

00:35:48.668 --> 00:35:50.294
There's no need to,

00:35:50.795 --> 00:35:54.131
but people like her
are impossible to figure out.

00:35:56.008 --> 00:35:57.843
We're done here.

00:36:02.306 --> 00:36:06.102
I'll start with a few questions
to establish a baseline.

00:36:06.185 --> 00:36:08.729
Please answer them with "yes" or "no."

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:12.525
Is your name Mo Eun?

00:36:13.526 --> 00:36:14.485
Yes.

00:36:14.568 --> 00:36:20.116
Are 920717 the first six digits
of your resident registration number?

00:36:20.866 --> 00:36:21.701
Yes.

00:36:24.161 --> 00:36:26.455
Is this within the normal range?

00:36:26.539 --> 00:36:29.375
Her baseline is reading
a bit higher than average.

00:36:31.043 --> 00:36:34.171
In contrast,
she has a very calm expression.

00:36:34.672 --> 00:36:35.923
Don't let it fool you.

00:36:36.007 --> 00:36:37.925
I've got this, thanks.

00:36:38.009 --> 00:36:40.469
You know neither of you
are supposed to be here.

00:36:40.553 --> 00:36:42.596
Yes, I'm sorry. We'll be careful.

00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:44.515
Why is An Yun-su's lawyer even here?

00:36:46.183 --> 00:36:47.560
Because this is important.

00:36:47.643 --> 00:36:49.520
The examiner gave me permission

00:36:49.603 --> 00:36:52.064
on condition that I just observe quietly.

00:36:52.565 --> 00:36:54.442
So shush.

00:36:54.525 --> 00:36:55.901
We'll begin now.

00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:04.076
Have you ever met An Yun-su
in the detention center?

00:37:05.703 --> 00:37:08.289
We may have crossed paths in passing.

00:37:08.789 --> 00:37:10.708
Please only answer with "yes" or "no."

00:37:10.791 --> 00:37:12.710
I'll ask more precisely this time.

00:37:12.793 --> 00:37:17.131
Have you ever come face-to-face
with An Yun-su in the detention center?

00:37:23.929 --> 00:37:24.930
No.

00:37:36.942 --> 00:37:39.028
Have you ever spoken to An Yun-su

00:37:39.111 --> 00:37:42.573
about Lee Ki-dae's murder
in the detention center?

00:37:51.749 --> 00:37:52.625
No.

00:37:56.796 --> 00:38:00.549
How many people have you killed
other than the dentist couple?

00:38:01.425 --> 00:38:03.219
A. None.

00:38:03.719 --> 00:38:05.471
B. One.

00:38:05.971 --> 00:38:07.765
C. Two.

00:38:08.265 --> 00:38:10.851
D. Three or more.

00:38:17.942 --> 00:38:18.776
Three or more.

00:38:21.862 --> 00:38:24.865
Does that mean she's killed more people?
It does, doesn't it?

00:38:26.158 --> 00:38:29.829
Her last answer was more stable
than when she said her name.

00:38:36.168 --> 00:38:40.047
Did you kill An Yun-su's husband?

00:38:43.134 --> 00:38:44.135
Yes.

00:38:46.804 --> 00:38:47.847
How unusual.

00:38:50.099 --> 00:38:51.934
With this, I'm not sure if we can tell…

00:38:52.977 --> 00:38:54.520
-What's your motive?
-Stop that.

00:38:54.603 --> 00:38:56.439
-Just give me a minute.
-Mr. Baek.

00:38:56.522 --> 00:38:57.523
-Hang on.
-Mr. Baek.

00:38:57.606 --> 00:38:59.442
-Hey!
-No need to say "yes" or "no."

00:38:59.525 --> 00:39:00.818
-Just tell me.
-You can't…

00:39:00.901 --> 00:39:03.988
Why did you kill An Yun-su's husband,
Lee Ki-dae? Tell me.

00:39:04.071 --> 00:39:04.989
What the hell?

00:39:11.912 --> 00:39:14.957
Does one really need…

00:39:17.126 --> 00:39:19.795
a reason to kill someone?

00:39:19.879 --> 00:39:22.465
Stop talking shit,
and give me a convincing answer.

00:39:22.548 --> 00:39:23.591
That's enough.

00:39:23.674 --> 00:39:24.842
I said tell me!

00:39:30.806 --> 00:39:32.099
But I don't want to.

00:39:55.581 --> 00:39:59.168
You've messed up the graph.

00:39:59.835 --> 00:40:02.254
It's completely meaningless
if she's tested like this.

00:40:03.839 --> 00:40:06.008
You'll do a great job
with the investigation.

00:40:06.091 --> 00:40:07.343
My apologies, sir.

00:40:15.017 --> 00:40:18.854
Do you know which part of the test showed
the most stable reading?

00:40:20.231 --> 00:40:21.357
"Three or more."

00:40:22.149 --> 00:40:24.443
It was when she admitted to
killing more people.

00:40:24.527 --> 00:40:27.488
Shouldn't you focus more
on uncovering the other murders

00:40:27.571 --> 00:40:30.950
than on disproving
that woman's confession?

00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:34.537
Is that advice?

00:40:35.621 --> 00:40:36.455
Yes.

00:40:37.581 --> 00:40:38.832
Well, aren't you helpful.

00:40:45.798 --> 00:40:47.091
Really?

00:40:50.094 --> 00:40:52.221
He's not even worth a single punch.

00:41:00.813 --> 00:41:03.065
This case needs a proper reinvestigation.

00:41:03.148 --> 00:41:04.942
-You want me to write an article?
-Yes.

00:41:05.734 --> 00:41:07.319
If you help me out a bit…

00:41:07.403 --> 00:41:12.658
The revelation of an enforced strip search
has sparked a major controversy.

00:41:12.741 --> 00:41:15.494
I'll see you tomorrow
at two o'clock, then. Thank you.

00:41:15.995 --> 00:41:17.580
…are receiving a lot of criticism…

00:41:17.663 --> 00:41:19.331
Okay, Seo is in.

00:41:20.124 --> 00:41:21.542
I just need to get Yoon now.

00:41:24.086 --> 00:41:28.215
Meanwhile, Mo,
during the prosecution interrogation…

00:41:28.299 --> 00:41:30.593
Hello, Mr. Yoon. Yes.

00:41:31.552 --> 00:41:32.845
Did you get my email?

00:41:37.683 --> 00:41:38.517
Nine o'clock news?

00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:40.561
Thank you so much.

00:41:41.061 --> 00:41:42.187
Yes, I'll see you then.

00:41:42.271 --> 00:41:43.731
REPORTER YOON
NINE O'CLOCK NEWS

00:41:43.814 --> 00:41:47.151
Just because you paint nudes
and enjoy drinking, smoking, and dancing

00:41:47.234 --> 00:41:48.736
doesn't mean you're a killer.

00:41:48.819 --> 00:41:52.781
Nor does smiling a lot, for that matter.

00:41:53.866 --> 00:41:56.410
However, the prosecution
subjected An Yun-su

00:41:56.493 --> 00:42:00.998
to media-driven abuse based on
these misunderstandings and prejudices.

00:42:01.498 --> 00:42:04.835
They branded a little girl's mother
as her father's killer

00:42:04.918 --> 00:42:08.047
and took both of her parents
away from her.

00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:11.800
And despite the real killer confessing,

00:42:11.884 --> 00:42:15.429
they're refusing to let An Yun-su
be reunited with her daughter

00:42:15.512 --> 00:42:17.848
because they won't admit they were wrong.

00:42:19.391 --> 00:42:21.018
I dare ask you all.

00:42:22.061 --> 00:42:23.854
Please help put an end to this abuse.

00:42:24.355 --> 00:42:27.107
You could be the next An Yun-su.

00:42:27.858 --> 00:42:33.614
When she cried out that she was innocent
four months ago, we did not listen.

00:42:37.826 --> 00:42:42.581
Justice was served not by the prosecution,
but by someone telling the truth.

00:42:42.665 --> 00:42:46.960
Of course, as the prosecution claims,
we can't assume An's innocence.

00:42:47.544 --> 00:42:50.506
Nevertheless, we must speak out

00:42:50.589 --> 00:42:55.636
and say that she at least deserves
a fair trial.

00:42:56.136 --> 00:42:57.805
And that her young daughter

00:42:57.888 --> 00:43:01.975
should not have to bear the weight
of the conflict between adults.

00:43:02.601 --> 00:43:07.439
At this time, An has applied for bail
ahead of her appeal hearing.

00:43:17.658 --> 00:43:19.618
GANGAN DAILY REPORTER HONG SE-YEONG

00:43:19.702 --> 00:43:22.079
SHOULDN'T HAVE DISMISSED
AN UNKNOWN LAWYER'S AMBITION

00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:26.250
PUBLIC HAS TURNED AGAINST YOU

00:43:26.333 --> 00:43:29.586
SHE'LL HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED FOR BAIL NOW
ANY CARDS LEFT TO PLAY?

00:43:39.138 --> 00:43:40.806
CHIEF PROSECUTOR SHIN YONG-SEOK

00:44:22.973 --> 00:44:23.891
Here you go.

00:44:28.979 --> 00:44:29.813
Thank you.

00:44:32.816 --> 00:44:33.984
Here she comes!

00:44:34.067 --> 00:44:35.402
She's out!

00:44:35.486 --> 00:44:37.029
Ms. An Yun-su!

00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:44.995
What is your plan from here?

00:44:56.006 --> 00:44:57.049
Ms. An!

00:45:01.303 --> 00:45:02.513
How do you feel?

00:45:05.182 --> 00:45:06.475
Just one comment, please!

00:45:11.939 --> 00:45:13.941
How does it feel
to be reunited with your daughter?

00:45:29.498 --> 00:45:31.583
Come here. It's okay.

00:45:35.546 --> 00:45:36.755
Don't look at them, Sop.

00:45:56.316 --> 00:45:57.317
There is

00:45:58.694 --> 00:46:01.572
someone I didn't get to kill that day.

00:46:03.448 --> 00:46:05.576
Someone I really should've killed.

00:46:10.539 --> 00:46:12.249
When you get out,

00:46:13.917 --> 00:46:16.169
I want you to kill that person for me.

00:46:19.047 --> 00:46:20.048
That's

00:46:21.466 --> 00:46:22.801
our deal.

00:50:10.862 --> 00:50:15.867
