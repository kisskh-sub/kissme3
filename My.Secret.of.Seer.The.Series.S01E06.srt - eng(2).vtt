00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.640
Here.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.000
Does it really help with love?

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.799
Of course, it does.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.400
This one...

00:01:35.401 --> 00:01:37.600
If you're falling for someone,

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.240
they'll surely be charmed by you.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.160
However, you need to recite

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.520
the incantation I told you.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.560
Tell him.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.720
He will certainly help you.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.720
I'll try it right away.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.200
And...

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.040
Do you have anything else
I can try?

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.200
Win,

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.840
how was the funeral?

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.840
Namo told me that
a ghost attacked you.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.400
Mm.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.360
What happened?

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.440
Apart from back when I was seven,

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.960
this would be
the first time in years

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.360
since I was locked away
in a temporal prison.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.320
A temporal prison?

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.440
A temporal prison

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.440
is the moment when time feels like

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.520
seconds in the realm of the dead,

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.040
but hours in the realm
of the living.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.920
But...

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.600
from what I can tell,

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.960
that old man ghost
shouldn't be that strong.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.000
The stuff about
your karmic creditor isn't over?

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.560
However,

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.440
there are two types of ghosts
with such an ability.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.360
The first one is a ghost
evoked by dark magic.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.400
The second one is a karmic creditor
with deep grudges.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.080
Still...

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.440
A karmic creditor
shouldn't have that much power.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.000
Why would your karmic creditor

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.200
simply torment you?

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.160
Why wouldn't it
just kill you outright?

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.280
You're right.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.840
Perhaps it wants

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.960
to possess me
and kill my loved ones.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.800
This is getting way worse.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.840
Right now,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
it'd be best if we stayed
far away from each other.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.080
It should be safer this way.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.560
It might be
a tough pill to swallow,

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.600
but it's the truth.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.360
The truth?

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.120
What are you talking about?

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.680
Tong is using dark magic.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.320
Nuts!

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.760
It's impossible.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.800
He's my friend.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.320
He's polite and gentle.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.240
He would never do such things.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.760
That's why I told you

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.640
it's a tough pill to swallow.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.880
If you see
a suspicious-looking idol,

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.320
destroy it.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.720
How am I supposed to believe you?

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:59.840
Gosh!

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.680
Here.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.960
Keep this in case of an emergency.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.040
Thank you.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.000
Didn't see you at the funeral.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:40.920
Why?

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.480
My leg got hurt quite a bit.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.680
Are you on a break?

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.160
Yes, I am.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.320
What about the stuff
I told you to give to Win?

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.560
The stuff?

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.320
I totally forgot about it.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:03.920
Uh...

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.880
I don't think now is the best time

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.240
to make a move on him.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:10.920
Not the best time?

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.200
Why?

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.120
He's currently going
through his bad luck year.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.160
Is that so?

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.280
Then why does he need
to be with Phloeng?

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.240
Uh...

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.320
I don't know why, actually.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.560
This is bad.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.200
The card revealed
doesn't look good.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.720
It's going to be a tough climb
to be in a relationship.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.120
Destiny aligns souls
who share equal merit, wisdom,

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.440
and spiritual power.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.520
Depending on who you are,

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.400
destiny will align you
with a soul of the same personality.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.760
We don't truly get
to choose, do we?

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.240
It's hard to explain.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.880
Free will is a concept
widely believed in the West.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.680
Here in Thailand,
we believe in reincarnation.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.640
And what do you believe in?

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.280
I don't know.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.160
Whatever...

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.000
Let's go home.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Let's call it here.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.520
Right. See you.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.680
- I'll meet you later.
- It's so fcking hot here.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.640
- Okay. See you.
- Why are we sitting here?

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.720
Hey!

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:49.600
Take it easy.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.960
If you jump,

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.920
you'll be reborn and die again
until your time is up.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:59.640
How about this?

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.240
I'll do a card reading for you

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.320
so that you'll see what you can do.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.080
I believe that
you'll get through this.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.600
You may have had
bad experiences in the past,

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.680
but deep down,
you're a good person.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.920
You can change
a lot of things for the better.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.880
I told you that I'm new to this.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.640
The reading even reveals that

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.520
you'll become famous
and well-known,

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:32.920
get to help others,

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.880
and own something big.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.120
So...

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.640
Don't cut your life short.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.440
Right.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:55.559
Hello, guys.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.720
You're back with Win, the seer.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:01.360
Tell me if you want to have me
do a reading about something.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.159
It can be love,

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.879
education, finance, or work.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.480
Feel free to submit your requests.

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.640
Oh!

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.720
Hello, Tachang.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.920
Thank you for sticking around
since I started livestreaming.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.360
Tell me if you want me
to do another reading.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.920
(Tul: It's okay.
(Take it easy, Master)

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:32.880
Well...

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.720
I'll be seeing you.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:45.880
Tong.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.160
Hm?

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.360
I think I'm going to take
a step further with Win.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.320
You're really going to date him?

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Mm.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:08.240
That's good.

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.400
Try hosting a show
outside the city.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.000
Not only will you get
to hang out outdoors,

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.400
but you'll also get
to go on a date with him.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.400
Sounds good?

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.040
Mm...

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.160
What kind of show?

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.640
A ghost-hunting show.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:32.320
You sure it's a good idea?

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000
It is.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.200
His sense is more powerful
than you think.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.200
Tarot card reading

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.800
is nothing but his toy.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:43.920
Really?

00:10:43.921 --> 00:10:46.080
I'm going to bring this up
in the board meeting.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.400
What the hell?

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.160
May the Goddess of Earth,

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:28.920
the Goddess of Water,

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.560
all divine beings,
guardian spirits,

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:33.400
and sacred entities

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.160
protect all living creatures

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.360
and turn any misfortune
that comes my way

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.440
into good fortune.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.560
Doing merit release again?

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.920
Oh, Phloeng?

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.080
We meet again.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.399
Did you put a tracking device

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.000
on me or something?

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.360
You're speaking nonsense again.

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.319
Throughout life,

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.559
having bad luck in itself

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:43.880
is already horrible.

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.400
But when those with special senses

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:47.880
are having bad luck,

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.280
the degree of misfortune
is doubled.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.160
Venerable Father

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:56.240
is very serious
about my bad luck year.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.120
Then what?

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:02.560
That's that.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.760
Lately, I've been seeing
weird things.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.920
If you stare at me a bit longer,

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.920
I'll take it
as you having a crush on me.

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.880
That's not the case.

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.080
Gosh.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:31.720
What a shame.

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.880
I don't have
romantic feelings for you.

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:40.840
It's just that I feel safe
when you're around.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.840
Safe? How so?

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.160
In this world,

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.720
you're the only person

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.680
who can help me deal
with my bad luck year.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:56.160
Really?

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:57.600
See?

00:13:57.601 --> 00:13:59.520
You don't believe me anyway.

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:01.599
Well...

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.800
It feels like
a love confession scene in a series.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:08.200
Just admit that
you have a crush on me.

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.920
Lying in front of a Buddha image
is bad, you know?

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:14.600
It's whatever at this point.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.360
Hi, Master.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:39.640
Are you tired today?

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:41.520
A little bit.

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:43.200
Are you still good?

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:44.760
Yes.

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.920
Have you received the gift
I told Tong to give to you?

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:50.560
The gift?

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.680
What is it?

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:56.280
That's okay.

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.720
I'm not going
to beat around the bush.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:14:59.760
Huh?

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:01.400
Well...

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.160
I want to get to know you better.

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:04.840
Get to know me?

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.680
We already know each other.

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.160
Like dating.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.240
Master.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Let's go home.

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.040
Let's go.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.480
Wait...

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:30.680
I can go home by myself.

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.680
- Didn't you say I'm...
- Wait!

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.080
I'll go home with you, I guess.

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:36.960
Have a good one, Tul.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.520
This abandoned house
will be our filming location.

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.280
Is it really safe?

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:58.680
Yes, it's 100% safe.

00:15:58.681 --> 00:16:00.400
There aren't any ghosts, I think.

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:02.440
How would there be any?

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:04.880
Maybe there are. Who knows?

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:07.440
Would this type of show
be too similar to someone else's?

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:09.440
How would that be?

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.600
We've got Master Win
as the star of the show.

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.359
If he's on our show,

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.440
imagine what it'll be like.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.560
You guys still in the meeting?

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:26.720
It's done.

00:16:26.721 --> 00:16:28.201
What's left is
tomorrow's run-through.

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:30.920
Go and rest up.

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:32.600
Okay, let's go, guys.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.200
Have you packed up your stuff?

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.480
Packed up my stuff?

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.480
We're leaving the city tomorrow.

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:12.240
Oh.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:13.960
It won't take long.

00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:15.560
I don't have many clothes.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:17.720
Right.

00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:21.400
What did Tul say to you?

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.360
Uh...

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:26.960
Oh,

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:29.400
Namo and Tong are sharing
the bedroom with me tomorrow,

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:32.200
so I won't be bothering
you like last time.

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:34.520
Right.

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:39.280
Phloeng.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.160
What is it?

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:42.680
If...

00:17:42.681 --> 00:17:45.119
If something bad
were to happen to me

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.640
- on this trip...
- I don't believe it.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:47.920
Come on.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:49.839
Can't you just go along?

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:51.320
It's just a hypothetical scenario.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.279
I said that

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:56.200
because I won't let it happen.

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.320
It's getting late.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:06.920
Get some rest, Master.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:07.920
You need to be up early.

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:13.960
If...

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:17.440
If I were to change my mind
and not go tomorrow,

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:18.800
would it look bad?

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.400
Very much so.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:24.800
Well then...

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.480
Thank you very much
for driving me home.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.799
Have a safe trip home,

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.440
and I'll see you tomorrow.

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:34.440
Right.

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:02.960
Here, Win.

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:04.639
Venerable Father
had me return this to you.

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.160
You dropped it back at the temple.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Right.

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.200
Thank you so much.

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:11.360
Mm.

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:28.320
Good heavens...

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.200
Hey...

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:32.919
Should we ask Venerable Father

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.480
if we can bring
a Buddha image with us?

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:36.520
The Tower...

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.280
It always spells disaster.

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:40.520
Yeah.

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:42.800
You also drew the card
in your third year.

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:45.040
Yeah.

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:46.560
That time, I fell over

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:47.960
and broke my arm.

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:49.480
I had to wear a cast for months.

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.400
Yeah, I remember that.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.720
Recently, luck hasn't been
on my side either.

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.720
This time, it's not just The Tower.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:59.520
It's accompanied by The Devil

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:00.760
and the Nine of Swords.

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.080
This means that my mental state

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.320
will be in jeopardy.

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:07.800
What should we do?

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:10.120
Should I call them
and cancel the project?

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:14.600
They're going
to be furious, though.

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:17.920
How about this?

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:24.280
Here!

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.400
The ultimate measure.

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:28.599
You'll be able
to get through this just fine,

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:29.600
right?

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:30.840
Yeah.

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.240
I've exorcised all kinds of ghosts.

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.520
This is just a karmic creditor.

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.719
I'll be able
to deal with it, right?

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:38.720
Yeah.

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:40.960
You've got this.

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:45.680
Tong,

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:49.360
has there been
anything strange happening?

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:51.920
No, there hasn't.

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:53.440
Everything seems normal.

00:20:58.280 --> 00:20:59.280
By the way,

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:00.759
what is that?

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:01.760
It's on the table.

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:04.400
This box?

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.240
Tul sent this over to you.

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:10.680
What is it, Tong?

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.360
I don't know.

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:15.440
A prop, I guess.

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:18.800
This is absolutely horrifying.

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.320
Are we talking about ghost stories
or performing a ritual?

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:24.880
Yeah, what the hell?

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:26.680
This is weird.

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:28.760
This is freaky.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.080
Maybe it's just a prop.

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:44.080
Alright.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:45.959
Tong, make some room.

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.640
- This can't fit.
- No, just jam it inside.

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:48.799
- It's going to fit.
- It's not.

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.120
- It's going to break.
- Gosh!

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:54.280
Can you stop focusing on stuffing
a sacred object into the bag?

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:56.640
You will never get it, will you?

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:57.920
I drew The Tower,

00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:58.840
The Devil,

00:21:58.841 --> 00:22:00.080
and the Nine of Swords.

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.199
But you said that

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:05.480
Phloeng has some kind of power
that can protect you.

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.720
This is just for good measure.

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:09.720
Get it? Good measure?

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.520
We don't know
what's going to happen.

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:13.560
Yeah.

00:22:13.561 --> 00:22:15.801
On top of that, he and I
are staying in a different room.

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.880
What if a ghost
attacks me at night?

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:19.840
Fine.

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.840
Should I ask them
to make changes to the bedrooms,

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:23.799
as you want to share
a bedroom with Phloeng?

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:24.280
Okay?

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.119
Hey, don't you dare ask them that.

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:26.840
Do it.

00:22:26.841 --> 00:22:28.879
- So you'll be safe from ghosts.
- Go for it.

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:29.880
I'll ask them, okay?

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:30.960
No, don't.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.320
Are they here?

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:34.560
Right?

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.120
- Maybe that's them.
- Right?

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:40.880
This way.

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.040
Thank you.

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:44.480
Okay.

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:47.680
Master, come with me.

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:49.560
No, come with me.

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:02.680
Win.

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:04.320
On this trip, you're done for.

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.240
Fcking hell!

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:08.880
No wonder you can't see ghosts.

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:11.160
Why are you rubbing it in?

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.120
Win,

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.160
are you sharing the van with Tul?

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:19.960
Uh...

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:22.400
Come and join me.

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.280
If anything happens,
my radiant thingy will protect you.

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:30.319
How about this?

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:31.400
Let me sort it out for you.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.320
Tong is going to be
in the same van as Tul.

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.800
As for Win,
you're going with Phloeng.

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:40.120
As for me, I'm coming with...

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:42.960
you, Tong.

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:47.720
Let's go, Win.

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:12.600
Welcome, everybody.

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:13.600
I'm Pong,

00:24:13.601 --> 00:24:15.240
the manager of this pool villa.

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:19.200
Since our housing project
is currently under construction,

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.799
only one unit is available,

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.000
and that being Nokphaeng's.

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.080
However, rest assured,

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.560
as for a few days,

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:29.160
I have put the construction on hold

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:30.800
to avoid any disturbances.

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:33.880
Also, the only guests here
are the 'Spooky Hellish Night' crew.

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.800
With that said,
feel free to go inside.

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:38.160
Thank you.

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:38.640
Let's go.

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:39.640
Win.

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:42.160
Tomorrow is a Buddhist holy day.

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:43.760
Are you going to be fine?

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:46.160
I'll be fine, Tong.

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.120
Okay.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:50.040
Alright, let's pick our bedrooms.

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.520
How's your bedroom?

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.720
You scared me, Tul.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.240
My apologies, Master.

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:54.280
I've seen the stuff you sent me.

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:56.680
Thank you.

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:57.320
Right.

00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:58.320
And...

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.920
When do you want me to use it?

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:03.080
When to use it?

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:04.520
What do you mean by that?

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:05.920
Well,

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:09.280
I'm talking about the stuff
you sent me for a ritual.

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:10.280
Huh?

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:11.640
That wasn't what I sent you.

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:12.720
Oh...

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:15.320
But...

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.560
I also want to talk
to you about something.

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.600
It's the topic that got cut short.

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:21.640
Right.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.440
Do I still have a chance?

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:27.840
Please don't, Tul.

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.200
Currently, my close ones

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:32.000
are dying.

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:35.680
I don't want anything bad
to happen to you.

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.280
Right.

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:43.920
Is it because of Phloeng?

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:46.720
No, it's not.

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:49.360
I mean it.

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.920
There's still so much more
you don't know.

00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.440
Can you help me
get the full picture?

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:13.440
You're making me
feel uncomfortable.

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:22.680
I don't know it either,

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:25.200
but I need to clear
something up with my friend.

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:27.240
Master,

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.599
we're shooting
the first EP tonight.

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:30.920
Let's discuss the schedule.

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:32.720
Sure.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:34.160
This way.

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:56.920
Job?

00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:59.120
Are you good?

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:03.360
Mm.

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:04.920
I'm good.

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:06.840
Just a little headache.

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:09.399
You should rest up first.

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:11.600
When it's time for the meeting,
I'll come and get you.

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:14.520
Let's go.

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:16.200
Rest well.

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:29.320
Everyone's here, right?

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:31.200
One, two, three, four,

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.600
five, six, seven...

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:35.080
What about Job?

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.920
He was the first
to come downstairs, though.

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:40.640
Well, where is he?

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:41.640
Call him.

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:57.560
He's not answering the phone.

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.280
That's fine.

00:29:00.281 --> 00:29:01.616
We'll start the meeting
without him.

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:03.200
He can manage
the schedule on his own.

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:07.560
There as well.

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:10.840
Guys...

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:13.560
How's everything, Ple?

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.120
I can't find him.

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:19.400
Pong said nobody had wandered off
toward the main office.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.399
Moreover, the guests staying here

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:23.960
are just our team, right?

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:27.240
If one of us were
to wander outside,

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:30.560
either the workers or the staff
should be able to spot them.

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:32.280
Where the hell is he?

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:35.760
Then we'll wait for another hour.

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:37.920
Then we'll look for him
if he doesn't return.

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:44.400
Hey,

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:46.200
is Job dead?

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.240
Dmn it, Namo!

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:50.640
Why the hell did you say that?

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:53.520
I was kidding.

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:56.440
Maybe he went
to a convenience store

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:57.880
and got stuck there
due to the rain.

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:01.080
You're the only one here
who sees it that way.

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:02.760
Is that a compliment or a jab?

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:03.920
Be clear about it.

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:05.720
Hey!

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.400
He sent me a message.

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:09.120
Let me see it.

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:10.120
What does it say?

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.360
This is the message he sent:

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:16.320
"Help me."

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:18.200
Help me?

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:19.680
What does he mean by that?

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:21.520
Hey...

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.040
Let me check where he sent it.

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:24.440
Do it as quickly as you can.

00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:28.799
Sht...

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:29.920
Why is that the location?

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:31.440
Try checking it again.

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:32.640
No, listen.

00:30:32.641 --> 00:30:34.440
It always ends up here.

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.440
Pong, is this location
in the woods?

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:38.840
It is.

00:30:38.841 --> 00:30:40.121
It's in the middle of the woods.

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:42.320
Perhaps,

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:43.640
he was sleepwalking.

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:45.439
He said he wanted a quick nap.

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:47.799
I then went out
to shoot some footage outside.

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:50.520
I remember that he tends
to sleepwalk a lot at night.

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.080
He sleepwalked into the woods?

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:56.640
My head hurts.

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:00.520
What should we do, Nokphaeng?

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:02.680
We probably need to look for him.

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:04.360
Do you have any flashlights?

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:05.560
We do.

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:07.760
- Can you please fetch them for us?
- No problem.

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:13.360
Check the location one more time.

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.480
What should the question be?

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:25.640
"Will Job make it out alive?"

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:27.440
That's such a terrible question.

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:30.200
Uh...

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:31.560
I've changed my mind...

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:34.080
"Will we be able to find Job?"

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:06.600
What do they mean?

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:10.320
I don't know.

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:11.400
What?

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:14.120
Try to focus.

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:24.440
Well then...

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:26.439
Look at the cards one at a time.

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:28.120
The first one is The Devil.

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:30.920
What does it mean?

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:34.160
In this context,

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:36.360
it symbolizes fixation.

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:38.280
See the card illustration?

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:39.920
There are two people

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:41.720
being chained.

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.600
Then there's the devil
between them.

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:46.800
What about the Three of Pentacles?

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:48.680
The Three of Pentacles?

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.240
A Pentacle symbolizes work.

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:53.576
The Three of Pentacles symbolizes

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:55.920
a negotiation between three people.

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:58.720
It also means trust.

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:01.920
What about the Seven of Cups?

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:04.280
The illustration is

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:07.640
a man looking at floating cups.

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:11.120
The positive meanings
are having plans,

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:12.400
a bright future,

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:14.040
and dreams.

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:16.080
As for the negatives...

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.200
They're daydreaming,

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:20.560
being unrealistic,

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:21.920
and procrastinating.

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:25.120
Combine these meanings
with the question

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:27.800
of how he's doing...

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:30.600
Use your sense.

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:33.160
It's raining.

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:36.520
My sensing power
is useless right now.

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:41.760
What about Toh?

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:45.840
I can't see him.

00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:47.400
Maybe he's not here with us.

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:51.440
Is Job being abducted by a ghost?

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:54.280
Watch what you're saying, Namo!

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.760
Come on, Win!

00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:57.960
We're in the middle of nowhere.

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.200
Also, Job sleepwalks a lot.

00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:02.200
It's just like a scenario
in a horror film.

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:05.680
If you're not stopping,

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:07.360
I'm going to send you flying.

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:08.400
What?

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.000
What I said was true.

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:38.680
Tul, are you alright?

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:40.560
Of course, I'm not.

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:42.360
A crew member has gone missing.

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:44.680
Is it because of that

00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:46.800
or because of Win?

00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:53.200
Why are you stirring the pot?

00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:55.440
Am I? Huh?

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:58.640
I told you that
he doesn't want to date you.

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:01.440
Why?

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:03.640
You want to cut me off from Win?

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:06.440
What are you saying?

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:09.680
You know it well.

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:26.160
Gosh...

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:32.280
What's wrong?

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:35.600
Nothing.

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.680
I can't sense anything.

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:43.400
Oh?

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:46.760
Nokphaeng is calling!

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:48.960
Really?!

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:55.960
How is it going?

00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:59.160
Job entered an abandoned house.

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:00.800
Huh?!

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:02.440
An abandoned house?

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:06.120
When Nokphaeng and the crew
entered the house,

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:08.040
they saw him sitting in a daze.

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:09.360
He's remained unresponsive.

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:11.560
Can you go there and check him out?

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:13.960
Why aren't they taking him out?

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:15.960
Getting him hospitalized
should be easier.

00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:17.240
What?!

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:19.880
Suddenly, Job is screaming, Master!

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:22.080
Nobody can overpower him.

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:25.280
When they tried to pick him up,
he became as heavy as a rock.

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:28.800
Is Phloeng there in the house?

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:31.960
Phloeng and his crew
are picking up doctors.

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:34.040
They're probably
joining them later.

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:37.200
Tell Phloeng to go there
as quickly as possible.

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:40.200
Where's the abandoned house?

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:44.960
Here it is.

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:56.120
What's going on, you guys?

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:00.200
Are there ghosts on this property?

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:06.720
Hurry.

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:11.160
Namo,

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:13.680
can you stop looking
excited for a second?

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:15.920
Come on! Win, my friend!

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:18.920
This is my first time
seeing someone get possessed!

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:21.360
I've never seen one in my life.

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:23.679
Are you insane?

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:24.680
What?

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:32.560
Tong...

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:34.880
Be honest.

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:36.600
What are you trying to do?

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:38.880
Do what?

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:40.960
About Tul.

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:45.040
I'm not trying to do anything.

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:51.520
Even though I can't sense it,
I know it.

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:18.040
We're here.

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:21.920
Where's Job?

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:23.920
He's on the second floor.

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:26.080
He's with Nokphaeng and the crew.

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:29.040
Right.

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.080
What is it, Win?

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:37.960
A murder occurred in this house.

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:44.600
Is there a presence of dark magic?

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:46.400
I'm not sure.

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:48.840
Should we head back?

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:54.960
This is doable.

00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:56.320
We've got people here.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.680
When there are a lot of people,
the supernatural won't dare harm us.

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:03.520
Namo,

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:05.720
where's the necklace?

00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:08.040
It's ready to go.

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:10.240
I have to put it on Job, right?

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:11.600
Mm.

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:13.560
Let's go.

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:16.120
- Let's go.
- To the second floor.

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:43.040
Namo...

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:46.480
This is spooky.

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.360
I'm getting the chills, too.

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:53.080
Tong, are you with us?

00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:54.920
Yes, I am.

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.200
Look at the picture.

00:39:58.800 --> 00:39:59.880
It's creeping me out.

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:06.840
Is it this room?

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:09.960
Try opening the door.

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:15.400
It's not budging.

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:32.720
Maybe it's this room?

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.400
I'm seeing nobody.

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:49.760
Yeah.

00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:52.160
Can you ask Ple?

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:55.360
Right, right.

00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:58.600
I'm seeing nobody in any room.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:19.560
What?

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:21.720
Ple hasn't been following us, Win.

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:23.960
Right?

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:26.320
Where did he go?

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:33.200
What?

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:35.600
Huh?!

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:45.720
Namo!

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:54.280
Tong!

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:56.200
Hey!

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:57.960
Hey!

00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:00.000
Tong, open the door!

00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:03.120
Tong!

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.080
Unlock the door!

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:07.840
Namo!

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:48.880
Depression,

00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:50.160
anger,

00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:51.800
sorrow, and anguish...

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:04.360
Hey!

00:43:04.361 --> 00:43:05.400
Let me out!

00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:07.120
Let me the fck out!

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:08.680
Or else I'll curse you!

00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:10.480
Namo!

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:16.120
Do you believe in ghosts?

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:28.440
You tricked both Win

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:29.400
and me.

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:30.560
Just what do you want?

00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:31.360
No matter what I say,

00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:32.760
you still won't love me.

00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:34.320
Are you ready?

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:35.520
I'm fcking ready!

00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:39.280
Hey! What is Win doing?!

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:40.440
Master!

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:44.040
Let go!

00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:45.240
It wants to take Win's life.

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:47.840
A person or not,

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:49.440
its power is immense.

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:50.640
Someone is behind this?

00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:53.480
If I were to die tomorrow...

00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:55.400
I've never kissed anyone before.

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:04.880
Is it the work
of destiny or fate?

00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:12.200
I have no choice but to accept it

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:20.960
I've tried so hard,
but it's impossible to run away

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:26.720
I have to accept that
things are here to stay

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:33.120
I've always thought that
love was just a ruse

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:40.400
I've never thought that
my true love would be you
