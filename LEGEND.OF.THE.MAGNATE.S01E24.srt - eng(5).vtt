[Legend of the Magnate]

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:37.860
[Episode 24]

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.430
You all, sit down!

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:52.509
I know

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:54.990
that wearing this outfit

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:58.090
dishonors our fallen brothers.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.440
But if I don't wear it,

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.140
I'd be betraying the friends
who risked their lives to save me.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.190
Neither could I save you all!

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.290
I know none of you fear death.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.770
Back on the day the city fell,

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.190
we had already

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.520
given up our lives.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.960
But today is different—

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.120
the battle is over.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.160
The battles of our entire lives are over!

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.000
From now on,

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.880
none of you are allowed to
touch weapons again.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.360
Wash yourselves clean,

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.000
shave your heads,

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.310
and go home.

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:58.750
Those who were craftsmen,
return to your craft.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.150
Those who were farmers,
go back to farming.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.250
The land has been left fallow.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.500
You'll need to plow it thoroughly.

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.000
Sow the seeds,

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.640
and live to see next year.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.800
You must believe—

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.680
believe that there is justice
in this world.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.850
If you don't believe it,

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.140
then treat it this way.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.400
-General!
-General!

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:49.590
Thank you for your hard work, Marshal Jiu.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.250
I'll go handle the aftermath.

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:52.190
Hold on.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.470
Thirty li to the west,

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.010
there's one of my camps.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.580
The travel permits and money
have been prepared.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.630
They can shave their heads,
change clothes,

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.160
take the money, and go home.

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:03.710
No one will stop them.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.160
Marshal Jiu, thank you for
keeping your word.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.660
Li Cheng... I mean,

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.010
General Li. I still need his head.

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:16.990
After all, I was the one
who took him away.

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:18.920
If the higher-ups ask about it,

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.630
I won't be able to handle it.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.040
Of course.

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:25.430
General Li's head

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:27.950
is worth a red official's hat.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.750
By order of Marshal Jiu:

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.560
the main force is to move 30 li west.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.870
Shave your heads, wash your faces,

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.159
collect your travel permits
and expenses,

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:44.890
and then return to
your respective hometowns.

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:45.270
Yes.

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.350
I've already made all preparations.

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:58.480
Ms. Bai.

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.600
If you feel sad, it's okay to cry.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.360
I won't cry.

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:08.310
I always knew

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.090
this day would come.

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.130
He got what he wanted.

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:23.970
I'm happy for him.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.300
He gave up his life

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.940
so that everyone else could survive.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.320
Such compassion

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.960
is something you should tell
your child about someday.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:54.340
Someone!

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:55.490
Take him away!

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.540
What are you doing?

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.230
Where are you taking him?

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.720
Where are you taking him?

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:21.930
They will give him a proper burial!

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:23.000
No, they won't!

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:24.930
They won't!

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:26.800
Put him down!

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.120
-Where are you taking him?
-Gu Pingyuan!

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.060
All they want is his head!

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:31.730
Those despicable people!

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:38.610
Where are you taking him?

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:40.210
You...

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.630
Where are you taking him?

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:42.390
Let go!

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:57.810
Ms. Bai still hasn't woken up,

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:00.790
and Pingyuan won't do any work either.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.080
The whole household
is relying on me alone right now,

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.480
using me like an ox.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.030
If my legs were in good shape,

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:08.730
I'd be the one taking care of things.

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:09.880
Nagging so much.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.240
You see, when others become officials,

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.320
it's all fancy sedan chairs

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.630
and mountains of gold and silver.

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:16.030
But what about Pingyuan?

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:16.720
Becoming an official

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:17.960
almost killed him.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.390
He just doesn't have a brain like mine.

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:22.910
If I, Gu Pingwen, were to be an official,

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:23.670
not to mention anything else—

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:25.730
I'd first get myself two concubines.

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:28.410
Go dream on.

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:33.370
Mother,

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.060
can I discuss something with you?

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:37.520
You know,

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:38.480
I'm a grown man,

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:39.670
and taking care of a female guest
every day—

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:40.910
it's also inconvenient for her.

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:41.720
If you ask me,

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:44.550
we should invite Miss Liao
to come help out.

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:46.350
It would be better for everyone.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:53.270
Doctor,

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:54.670
thank you for your hard work.

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:55.200
Please,

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.580
come and have some tea.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.200
Doctor,

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:03.990
how's her condition?

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:06.750
Her lungs and internal organs

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:08.330
are cold above and inflamed below.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:10.260
The inflammation won't break out.

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:12.400
Ms. Bai just refuses to wake up.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.640
She's heartbroken.

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:17.310
You're just a kid.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:18.940
You wouldn't understand.

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:20.330
Go check on Ms. Bai.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:23.720
Doctor,

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.670
is there any good solution?

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:27.730
Her pulse

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:29.910
is even weaker than
an 80-year-old man's.

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:31.370
When someone wants to die,

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:33.720
even legendary physicians
like Bian Que and Hua Tuo

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.720
would be at a loss.

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:48.520
Ms. Bai.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:54.500
It's okay. It's okay.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:57.690
Ms. Bai.

00:10:57.830 --> 00:10:58.630
It's okay now.

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:00.510
It's okay.

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:43.240
Father.

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.550
Father,

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:50.030
I finally get to see you.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.030
Father.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:54.910
Silly kid.

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:56.630
Why are you crying?

00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:59.000
Did you have a nightmare?

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:01.750
Yes.

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.600
Where am I?

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.570
Don't you recognize it?

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:10.600
All over this mountain

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.400
is our family's tea plantation.

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:14.240
I often drink tea here.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.460
You'd promise

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:17.000
to play Go with me,

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.320
but before we could set up the pieces,

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.720
you'd fall asleep.

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:24.320
Did I sleep for long?

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.750
About the time it takes
for an incense stick to burn.

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:27.550
What's wrong?

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.600
What did you dream about?

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:35.490
I dreamed that

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:37.440
suddenly there was chaos and war.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.120
Yimei!

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:39.670
I was captured

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.720
and taken to the enemy's military camp.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.600
I dreamed that Gu came back

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.440
and rescued me from the camp.

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:49.600
I dreamed...

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.720
It really is you.

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:53.940
I prayed to it every day...

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:54.790
I dreamed...

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:56.910
Just to let me see you again.

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.150
For that, I'd even accept the fate

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:00.480
of being torn into pieces with no regrets.

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:04.840
I fell in love with a general.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.090
All of you...

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:10.360
All of you were mad at me.

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:13.840
Later, he died.

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:17.240
Everyone died.

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:21.010
And I was pregnant with his child.

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:24.140
Father.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.310
All of that was just a dream,

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:26.910
right?

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:29.750
I've never had

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:31.000
such a long dream before.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.160
I was terrified.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:33.630
Now I feel

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:34.930
as if I've been reborn.

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:35.970
Father.

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.030
I won't make you angry

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:40.270
ever again.

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:43.440
Good girl.

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.720
Let me ask you something:

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:09.970
if that general were to come back,

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.930
you would still go with him, wouldn't you?

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:18.270
Even though it was a dream,

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:19.790
your feelings were real.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:22.670
Kid.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.720
I won't be angry with you.

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:28.240
No matter what you do,

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.540
as long as you live this life in peace,

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:34.200
my wish will be fulfilled.

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:08.240
Who is it?

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.290
Coming. Coming.

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:17.750
Mr. Hou Er.

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.340
Old Master Hu.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.840
My brother isn't feeling well.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:22.870
He can't receive visitors.

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:24.280
We came here

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.690
specially to see Mr. Gu.

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:27.550
Since that's the case,

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:28.670
I won't go in.

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:29.600
Hou Er.

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:30.630
The gifts.

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:31.520
Old Master Hu.

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:32.690
[Fortune and Peace]

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:33.790
Mr. Gu.

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:34.360
You...

00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:36.330
Why are you up?

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:39.390
Weren't you feeling unwell?

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:39.990
This is...

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:40.790
Old Master Hu,

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:41.940
sorry for neglecting you.

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:43.080
Come on, let's talk inside.

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.140
Alright, alright.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:45.880
Old Master Hu,

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:47.630
whatever you have to say,

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:49.160
please speak frankly.

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:50.720
I heard

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:54.440
you have an old connection

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.690
with Li Wantang's family in the capital?

00:16:57.690 --> 00:16:59.750
I wouldn't call it an old connection.

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:01.340
I am somewhat acquainted

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:02.610
with his son, Li Qin,

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:04.000
but Li Wantang

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:05.589
is the wealthiest man
north of the Yangtze River.

00:17:05.589 --> 00:17:07.160
How could I ever associate with
someone of his status?

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.000
I see.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.270
Your "Top Tea Under Heaven"

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.329
has really angered him.

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:16.750
He's gathered many tea merchants,

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:18.349
and now they're all united against us.

00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:20.680
Not a single tael of Anhui tea

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.740
is allowed to be purchased this year.

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.960
Li Wantang actually
has that much influence?

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:25.480
[Top Tea Under Heaven]

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.960
Well, Mr. Li Million

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:28.830
is prominent and wealthy.

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:29.550
And we

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.050
have known each other for quite some time.

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:33.410
How about we

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:35.450
ask Mr. Li to come out and mediate?

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.010
After all, Gu Pingyuan's matter

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.570
is his personal affair.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Dragging all of us

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.640
Anhui tea merchants into it

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.830
seems rather inappropriate,
don't you think?

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:46.780
-Yes, exactly.
-That's right.

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:48.110
His personal affair?

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:51.350
This plaque is hanging here
in the Tea Merchants' Association.

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:52.640
How do you explain that?

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:53.240
No, no, no.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.280
It's not what you think it is.

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:56.540
The Empress Dowager

00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:57.160
[Top Tea Under Heaven]

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.480
bestowed this plaque upon us.

00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.720
We didn't ask for it.

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.000
It's like a pie falling from the sky
and hitting us on the head—

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.450
we've got no say in it.

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:04.290
Well...

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:05.880
And now, it's brought resentment

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.030
against us Anhui tea merchants.

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:08.270
We feel wronged too.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.240
That's right.

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:10.080
Exactly.

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:10.840
I understand

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:12.200
your reasoning,

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.790
but those tea merchants won't accept it.

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:16.790
They lost so much money,

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:19.380
and your Anhui tea got all the glory.

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:20.350
[Top Tea Under Heaven]

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:21.750
In times like these,

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:23.960
with war and chaos everywhere,

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:25.040
wherever you go,

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:26.820
money does all the talking.

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:29.250
My father

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:31.370
doesn't have that much influence.

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:33.970
I've come here this time

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:34.790
to discuss

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:36.110
with all of you.

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:38.350
If, in the future,

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:40.550
you still want to work

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:41.640
with the Li family,

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.520
you'll have to give us a discount

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:46.240
on this batch of spring tea.

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:49.040
That Li Wantang has connections
with foreigners.

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:50.480
They've secretly

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.640
formed some kind of

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.280
offense-defense alliance.

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:56.310
Those foreigners

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:58.540
aren't buying even a single tael of tea
from us this year.

00:18:58.540 --> 00:18:59.640
This is really bad.

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:01.400
Hold on, Old Master Hu.

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:03.000
Though my family has grown tea
for generations,

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:03.660
I don't have

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:05.760
much experience in selling it.

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:07.320
I'll need you to teach me.

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:08.160
Well,

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:10.160
in previous years, our Anhui tea

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.800
had three destinations.

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:12.510
First,

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:14.960
it went to tea shops across the country.

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.350
Second, a portion

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.800
was sold to Mongolia, Tibet, and Xinjiang.

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.160
And third—

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:21.530
which is the majority—

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:23.120
was shipped to Guangzhou,

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:25.350
where the 13 Trading Houses would handle

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:27.480
consignment sales to the foreigners.

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:30.610
Our entire Anhui Province's tax revenue

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.270
and the people's livelihood

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:33.400
depend on this.

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:35.400
Now that we're at war,

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.990
the imperial court has allowed us

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:39.480
to ship it to nearby Shanghai.

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:41.440
But this year, the Shanghai contract

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:42.510
has been delayed.

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:43.850
After looking into it,

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.880
we found out that it had been

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:46.920
intercepted by Li Wantang.

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.830
He's obtained the exclusive right
to trade tea,

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:50.480
so the foreign merchants
won't do business with us anymore.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.070
We've thought about it again and again,

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:53.110
and there was really no other way.

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:55.550
That's why they sent me
to come talk to you.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:58.110
What's the point of talking to me?

00:19:58.110 --> 00:19:59.590
I've never dealt with foreigners before.

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:01.050
You're different from us.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.160
After all, you hold an official position.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.960
You could at least mediate for us

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:06.810
and help us Anhui tea merchants

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:07.400
to...

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:09.230
To overcome this crisis.

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.310
As a Pacification Commissioner,

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:12.750
I do have to deal with

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:13.440
officials,

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:14.880
but I myself

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:15.940
am not an official.

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.580
As you know,

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:19.920
I'm an exile

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:21.440
who escaped from Ningguta.

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.240
I've been through hell and back.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:25.310
Now that I've finally made it back
to Huizhou,

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:26.970
just being able to enjoy peace

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.800
and take care of my mother at home

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.820
makes me completely content.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.430
As for becoming an official,

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:33.430
or being like you,

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:35.510
managing so many tea merchants,

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:37.640
I truly have no such ambition anymore.

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.200
Please understand.

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:46.110
I see.

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:51.760
Well then...

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:55.390
Sorry for disturbing your rest.

00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:57.680
I'll be on my way.

00:20:58.790 --> 00:20:59.590
Old Master Hu.

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:03.160
What is Li Wantang

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:05.200
really up to,

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:07.880
bullying us Huizhou merchants like this?

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.240
He says your Top Tea Under Heaven

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.510
has stolen his thunder,

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:11.640
and if you don't die,

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:12.700
he won't rest easy.

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:15.980
Did he really say that?

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:20.890
He won't rest easy until I'm dead?

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:21.560
Well then.

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:24.480
I'll make him even more uneasy.

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:27.380
This matter needs to be handled fairly,

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:30.240
so my father can have
more credibility out there.

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:32.590
So how much of a discount
do you want?

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:36.480
Just tell us.

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:37.270
Say it.

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:40.030
80% off.

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.200
80% off?

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:43.790
Why don't you just rob us then?

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:45.520
Yeah, might as well be robbery!

00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:48.190
How can you do business
with no conscience?

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:50.070
Everyone, please.

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:50.720
Everyone!

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:51.790
Everyone.

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:53.880
Don't rush.

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.260
One at a time, please.

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.550
My father isn't the only one in this world

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:00.440
who knows how to sell tea.

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:01.880
You've been in the tea business

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:02.940
your entire lives.

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:05.750
Each of you is an expert.

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:07.680
Logically speaking,

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.530
even if I rushed to learn,
I wouldn't qualify.

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:12.050
But there's one thing.

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:13.440
The Li family,

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.240
blessed by His Majesty's favor,

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.090
represents the imperial court

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:20.200
in overseeing

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.600
all foreign trade of tea.

00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:24.240
Any fluctuation in this business

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.580
could bring serious trouble.

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:32.590
Using the imperial court's power

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:34.000
to force people into doing business

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.660
is hardly the act of a true man.

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:39.440
Old Master Hu.

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:47.350
I knew it was you.

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:49.680
Last time
you informed Yu'er and Mr. Chang

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:50.740
to come and save me,

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:52.320
and I haven't had the chance
to thank you in person.

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:53.510
No need for that.

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:55.000
So,

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.440
you've made up your mind

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.040
to get involved in this mess?

00:22:58.400 --> 00:22:59.000
Everyone.

the original discount request.

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:07.280
But that's as far as I'll go.

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:09.920
You're quite full of yourself.

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:12.370
I'm afraid I can't agree with you, buddy.

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:13.960
Then we'll see about that.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.220
I'll stay at the inn for 3 more days,

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:23.250
and then I'll return to the capital.

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:24.700

have any objections?

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:07.200
If he really takes advantage of
the imperial court's power,

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.400
I'm afraid even Mr. Gu
wouldn't be able to win.

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:10.660
So what if we can't win?

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.760
Should we just end our own lives?

Li Wantang has powerful connections.

Pingyuan went through so much trouble

to save her life and bring her back.

00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:00.410

then all Pingyuan's efforts

It's not like I'm unreasonable.

In my opinion, on this matter,

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:19.750
Pingyuan made a mistake.

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:22.000
Even I, Gu Pingwen, am smarter than he is.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:22.440

She owes us too much.

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:38.240
That engagement since childhood,

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:38.680
right?

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:40.640
She ran off with that commanding general

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.700
and even got pregnant with his child.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.680
Pingyuan spent so much effort and money

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:45.350
and almost lost his life

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:46.880
just to save her from death.

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.440
It's not worth it
no matter how you look at it.

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.750
Yes, right.

You're smarter than Pingyuan,

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:53.820
aren't you?

00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:55.950
Look how smart you...

00:29:56.510 --> 00:29:58.110
Stand up and look at yourself.

00:29:58.110 --> 00:30:00.020
Look at all this dirt from kneeling.

00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:01.660
All this dust. Look at you.

00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:09.550
Don't pull me in broad daylight.

00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:10.350
How inappropriate.

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:11.550
Easy now. Easy, easy.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:12.960
Where's my father?

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:13.830
Where is he?

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:15.070
Haven't seen him.

00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:16.000
He went to buy medicine.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:16.800
Buy medicine?

00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:19.400
He had no money.
How could he buy medicine?

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:21.030
H-He came by earlier,

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:22.360
asking what I was doing.

00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:23.590
I said I was back from work,

00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:24.440
and that I told you

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:25.510
I was going down the mountain
to buy medicine.

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:26.920
He said... He said he would go instead,

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:28.180
so I gave him the money.

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:30.310
How many times have I told you

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:31.550
not to give him money?

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:33.000
He won't come back until he's gambled away

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.400
everything down to his pants.

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:35.590
I've told you so many times.

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:36.940
Why can't you remember?

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:37.960
No, it's not like that.

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:39.270
Isn't he your father?

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:40.270
Just consider it my way of
showing respect to him,

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:40.960
okay?

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:41.830
Otherwise, if he

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:42.400
gets angry

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:43.510
and doesn't approve of our marriage,

00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:44.750
what am I supposed to do then?

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:45.310
You

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:46.590
are in for trouble.

00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:51.640
I brought you two cans

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:52.590
of such fine tea,

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.680
yet here you are, drinking wine.

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:57.790
Tea only makes you more sober.

00:30:58.460 --> 00:30:59.960
Why don't you join me for a drink instead?

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:00.440
Here.

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:03.500
Try this wine the foreigners gave me.

00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:15.410
Such a good thing you have here.

00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:16.000
Try it.

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:21.830
If you like it,

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:22.920
I have plenty.

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:25.910
I'll have someone deliver a few barrels
to your home.

00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:28.160
Well, how about

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:31.000
introducing me to
some foreign merchants as well?

00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:33.640
If I did that,

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.510
my father would beat me

00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:36.200
to death.

00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:38.790
I'd be biting the hand that feeds me.

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:42.680
Your father is always so harsh

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:43.880
when dealing with me.

00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:45.530
After all, I'm his junior.

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.270
If you ask me,

00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:54.070
my father has been quite nice to you,

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:56.110
not harsh at all.

00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:57.830
At that Grand Tea Competition,

00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:59.790
my father spent money like water

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.590
and finally built a stage,

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:03.830
only for the whole thing

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:05.430
to become your one-man show.

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:08.160
He doesn't just hate you—

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:10.480
he even wants to eat you alive.

00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:14.480
I think this time, buddy,

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:16.130
you've stirred up a hornet's nest.

00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:17.290
So many tea merchants

00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:18.400
and so much money

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:22.080
all ended up benefiting
the Anhui tea merchants.

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.960
What even is that "Top Tea Under Heaven"?

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:25.310
I've never heard of it.

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:26.770
You must be joking with me.

00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:28.680
My father

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:31.760
arrived with his head held high,

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:33.690
yet left completely dejected.

00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:35.250
If people start saying

00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:37.310
that even Li Million has times

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:38.680
when he can't be counted on,

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:39.550
wouldn't that ruin his reputation?

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:41.550
Who else should he get back at
if not you?

00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:43.210
He won't be able to explain it.

00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:55.270
What's the deal with

00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:57.040
the Anhui Tea Merchants' Association?

00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:59.840
Are they determined to turn against
the Li family?

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:02.010
Your father is too ruthless,

00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:02.960
trying to buy their spring tea

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:04.550
at 20% of the original price.

00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:06.480
It doesn't even cover labor costs.

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.300
About this matter,

00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:16.750
I have no say in it.

00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:19.930
I'm just delivering the message.

00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:22.210
Do you know why he sent me?

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:23.550
Four words:

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:25.350
to take the blame.

00:33:27.010 --> 00:33:28.550
That's refreshingly honest.

00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:29.130
Indeed it is.

00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:30.240
I actually came here

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:31.550
planning to have

00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:33.070
a proper competition with you.

00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:34.000
But in this situation,

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.240
it would be too unfair.

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:36.160
Maybe next time,

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:36.960
when I have my own

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:37.680
business.

00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:39.270
So when will you

00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:40.640
have your own business?

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:41.780
My father said,

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:44.200
once the south is reclaimed,

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:45.880
he'll let me manage

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:46.650
our family's

00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:47.610
salt business.

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:49.160
That's over 300 salt shops

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:51.830
in 7 southern provinces
and 6 northern provinces.

00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:53.880
Actually, I don't need all 300 shops.

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:54.480
Just one.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.400
Just one would be enough.

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:58.780
As long as I can make my own decisions,

00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:00.000
instead of following him around

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:00.790
all day long,

00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:02.550
doing these thankless jobs.

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:09.840
Where are you going?

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:11.190
To find some foreign merchants.

00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:12.110
I can't really be driven to death

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:13.310
by your father, can I?

00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:16.630
But you don't know anyone.
How do you want to find them?

00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:19.760
Do you know Hart,

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:20.920
the Customs Commissioner?

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:22.920
Do you know Richard

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:24.280
from Xianghe Trade House?

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:25.409
Have you ever been to

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:26.690
the Shanghai Bund?

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:32.320
If you ask me,

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:34.000
this is what you should do:

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.590
go buy a rope

00:34:35.949 --> 00:34:36.920
and hang yourself

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:38.030
from the beam at our doorway.

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:39.150
I'll take your body

00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:40.400
to my father so he can vent his anger.

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:42.460
I promise to give you a proper burial.

00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:44.550
Once you have your own business,

00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:46.550
I'll definitely teach you a lesson.

00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:48.150
Take care! See yourself out.

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:53.280
I just borrowed money from him yesterday.

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:54.630
Think of something.

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:55.710
I'll have to make up an excuse.

00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:56.400
Otherwise,

00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:57.840
he'll think I'm being unreliable again.

00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:59.150
Now you know to think things over?

00:34:59.150 --> 00:34:59.760
Pingwen.

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:01.880
Pack your things and come with me
to Shanghai.

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:02.670
We're leaving this afternoon.

00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:03.420
I'll go tell Mother.

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:05.760
Pingyuan, I still have something
to attend to.

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:06.400
What is it?

00:35:08.290 --> 00:35:10.670
Her father is being held at
the gambling house down the mountain.

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:11.530
What happened?

00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:12.580
I told Pingwen

00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:14.320
not to give my father any money.

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:15.510
Pingwen is such a fool.

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:16.230
Yesterday, he gave

00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:17.440
my father some pennies.

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:18.250
Guess what happened?

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:19.960
He didn't come back last night.

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:21.300
The gambling house just sent word

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:22.560
that he lost 500 taels,

00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:23.960
and we must pay his ransom
by this afternoon.

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:24.670
Two hours late

00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:25.920
means one finger off.

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:28.360
We were just discussing what to do.

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:29.480
What's there to discuss?

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:30.230
I'll give you the money,

00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:32.030
and you go bail him out right away.

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:32.800
I need to go on a trip with Pingwen

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:33.930
in the next few days.

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:35.400
Please take care of Ms. Bai

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:36.230
and my mother.

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:36.760
Okay.

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:38.760
Pingyuan, you're so generous.

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:40.670
Actually, we were just talking about

00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:41.960
how to find an excuse

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.400
to borrow money from you.

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:45.370
You just say everything out loud!

00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:49.270
She hits me every day.

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:51.200
I've really spoiled her.

00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:59.440
Tell her that this money

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:01.590
is a gift to show our respect
to her father,

00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:02.630
not something she borrowed from us.

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:04.490
Don't say anything unnecessary.

00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:05.730
Pack your things.

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.640
[Gu's Mansion]

00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:21.440
Gu.

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:25.420
What did the doctor say?

00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:26.620
When will she wake up?

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:30.590
The doctor said she refuses to wake up.

00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:34.450
Refuses to wake up?

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:38.800
It's a blessing to refuse to wake up.

00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:41.220
I don't have such blessing.

00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:49.880
From now on, you'll be taking care of her.

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:50.810
Talk to her more.

00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:54.000
I...

00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:56.110
What should I say?

00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:58.330
Tell her

00:36:59.110 --> 00:37:01.440
she's still pregnant with
Li Cheng's kid,

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:02.590
and she still needs to

00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:03.440
raise the kid.

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:05.810
She has no right to die.

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:08.280
I...

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:10.490
I'll tell her exactly that?

00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:13.760
Or what else would you like to say?

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:16.940
I've been through life and death
so many times,

00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:18.800
yet I still managed to crawl back.

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:38.920
How much do you think

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:40.520
it will cost to buy this ship?

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:42.550
How would I know?

00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:45.380
This is the reason

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:46.630
why the foreigners could run amok

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:47.760
on our river.

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:49.420
Meanwhile, our merchants

00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:50.880
are still fighting among themselves,

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:52.480
having the time of their lives.

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:53.280
How pathetic.

00:37:57.590 --> 00:37:58.190
Pingyuan.

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:00.180
Can I discuss something with you?

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:02.070
If you don't want to be
the Pacification Commissioner anymore,

00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:03.630
let me have the position
for a couple of days.

00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:04.880
You can't even manage a shop properly,

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:06.000
and you want to be
the Pacification Commissioner?

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:06.550
Look, since I

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:07.630
took this position,

00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:09.400
have I had a single peaceful day?

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:10.400
Once we go ashore,

00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:11.320
we'll first visit

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:13.180
Hart, the Customs Commissioner.

00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:18.140
[Shanghai, Hart's Residence]

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:43.500
What are you doing?

00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:48.030
His accent is even better than mine.

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:50.670
Our Mr. Hart

00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:52.110
is favored by the imperial court

00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:54.110
and oversees the Qing Empire's customs.

00:38:54.110 --> 00:38:55.110
His son

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:56.700
even earned a degree
in the imperial examination.

00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:58.480
His eight-part essay was so well written

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:00.480
that the chief examiner was amazed.

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:04.500
That little bastard you were talking about

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:05.860
actually became a scholar candidate.

00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:07.920
Let's see how he does in the next exam.

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:09.960
Mr. Gu,

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:12.920
if you have something to say, go ahead.

00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:14.590
Mr. Hart,

00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:16.880
I'd like to ask you
to arrange a meeting with

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:18.110
Mr. Richard from Xianghe Trade House.

00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:19.440
I want to get to know him.

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:21.690
Why do you want to meet him?

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:24.030
With the recent victory in Hefei

00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:25.920
and the abundant tea harvest
in Anhui this year,

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:28.110
our province is waiting for this money.

00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:30.110
Tea farmers need to support
their families,

00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:31.750
the government needs to
comfort the refugees,

00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:33.400
and the imperial court also hopes
that local regions

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:35.030
can recover their strength
as soon as possible.

00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:36.750
But Mr. Richard

00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:38.190
isn't buying a single tael of tea
from Anhui

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:38.960
this year.

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:41.700
I don't understand what he means by that.

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:44.510
Business is inherently

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:47.880
voluntary between both parties.

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:50.280
Richard is a merchant.

00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:52.590
He works for the East India Company.

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:53.960
If he doesn't want to buy,

00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:55.030
you can't force him

00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:56.670
with your official position, right?

00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:58.800
But I can't just go back empty-handed.

00:39:58.860 --> 00:39:59.660
How abut this?

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.800
Please arrange a meeting with him anyway.

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:03.000
If I can't make a deal,

00:40:03.110 --> 00:40:05.110
you can count it as my incompetence.

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:07.240
You're in luck today.

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:09.340
He's having tea in my backyard.

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:11.110
However,

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:12.550
I must warn you.

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:15.310
This man is someone
you can't afford to offend.

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:19.550
So technically,

00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:20.440
the whole ship

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:21.440
was looking at me,

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:23.000
and it was so funny.

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:24.320
And I was like,

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:25.280
what,

00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:26.280
why?

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:29.360
Look at these guys.

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:32.740
-Probably asking for money.
-Ladies, if you'll excuse us.

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:37.110
This is Mr. Richard.

00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:38.880
This is Mr. Gu,

00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:41.670
representing the Anhui Tea Merchants.

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:43.280
He came from his hometown.

00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:51.440
Mr. Richard.

00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:52.590
I'd like to know

00:40:52.590 --> 00:40:54.030
why you're not purchasing

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:55.630
any tea from Anhui this year.

00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:57.840
[Richard, Director of Xianghe Trade House]

00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:58.900
Is there a problem?

00:40:59.070 --> 00:40:59.630
I'm here representing

00:40:59.630 --> 00:41:01.150
the Anhui Tea Merchants' Association.

00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:03.350
I'd like to know the reason behind this.

00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:06.070
I've signed an exclusive contract

00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:07.630
with Mr. Li Wantang from the capital.

00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:09.360
I only buy tea from him.

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:11.840
Whether that tea is from Anhui or not

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:12.970
doesn't concern me.

00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:15.550
Your dispute

00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:18.070
doesn't concern me, either.

00:41:18.070 --> 00:41:19.670
Please don't waste my time.

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:28.480
We don't need to be

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:30.080
so confrontational from the start.

00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:31.590
Anhui has always been

00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:33.860
a major tea-producing province
in our country.

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:35.910
Li Wantang can choose to give it up,

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.670
but can you really bear to give it up?

00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:39.130
It's a huge business deal.

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:42.210
Though the deal is good,

00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:43.670
I cannot afford to offend

00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:44.590
my partner.

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:47.340
The Qing Empire has 18 provinces.

00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:48.550
Losing one

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:50.520
doesn't matter.

00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:52.400
That's the conclusion.

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:53.240
Conclusion?

00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:55.230
Also,

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:59.590
don't try to negotiate with
other foreign merchants.

00:42:00.070 --> 00:42:02.760
The Great Qing Legal Code
forbids Chinese people

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:05.630
from doing business
with foreigners privately.

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:11.510
I advise you not to speak so absolutely.

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:13.170
I can give you another chance.

00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:18.760
Chance?

00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:21.710
What chance?

00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:24.760
To put me on a ship back to England?

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:30.510
My god.

00:42:33.070 --> 00:42:34.470
Want to make a bet with me?

00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:37.470
I bet you'll regret it.

00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:42.230
Pingyuan,

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:43.630
don't be mad.

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:55.920
Captain Tod wants to know

00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:57.120
what brings you here.

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:01.190
Ask him

00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:02.630
if this ship is for sale.
