HONGSEO EDUCATIONAL FOUNDATION DIRECTOR
AND HONORED GUESTS ON OPENING DAY

00:01:19.142 --> 00:01:22.687
A FEW MONTHS EARLIER

00:01:25.481 --> 00:01:27.483
They're all our music majors.

00:01:28.026 --> 00:01:29.027
Hello, you're here.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.030
This is Jin Young-in,
the lawyer who donated that painting.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.870
Hello.

00:01:45.501 --> 00:01:47.378
-Honey, over here.
-Hi, honey.

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:49.881
I'm sorry. I'm late, aren't I?

00:01:49.964 --> 00:01:52.258
Director Kim, this is my wife.

00:01:52.342 --> 00:01:54.761
Hello, I'm Choi Su-yeon.

00:01:54.844 --> 00:01:58.139
Hello, I know who you are.
You're Choi Su-yeon, the cellist.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.019
Thank you so much
for donating such a valuable painting.

00:02:03.102 --> 00:02:04.729
Our art gallery gained recognition.

00:02:04.812 --> 00:02:06.147
-We owe it to you.
-Come on.

00:02:06.814 --> 00:02:09.400
-Hello, Director Kim.
-I'm glad you could make it.

00:02:09.484 --> 00:02:10.485
Congratulations, sir.

00:02:10.568 --> 00:02:12.820
You made it, Lee. Say hello.

00:02:12.904 --> 00:02:14.739
This is Jin Young-in. He's a lawyer.

00:02:14.822 --> 00:02:17.367
He's a newly appointed professor
at our law school.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.245
He's probably handled more criminal cases

00:02:20.328 --> 00:02:23.164
than any other lawyer in Korea.

00:02:23.915 --> 00:02:25.083
I'm Jin Young-in.

00:02:25.166 --> 00:02:26.918
Hello, nice to meet you.

00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:28.211
Lee, come this way.

00:02:29.754 --> 00:02:31.965
This is Lee Ki-dae, an artist.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.927
I've been wanting him
to join our faculty as well,

00:02:36.511 --> 00:02:38.054
but he's holding out.

00:02:39.597 --> 00:02:41.266
Lee, come with me for a moment.

00:02:43.017 --> 00:02:46.020
I hear this is by an African artist
who's gaining recognition.

00:02:46.104 --> 00:02:47.480
You must've heard of them too.

00:02:48.106 --> 00:02:48.940
Yes.

00:02:49.023 --> 00:02:51.025
I hear H Group Chairman Hwang

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:54.696
also collects Sokoboako's works.

00:02:55.947 --> 00:02:58.825
What's it like seeing it in person?
Share your thoughts.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.995
Well,

00:03:02.745 --> 00:03:06.457
it was their originality
that drew a lot of attention at first,

00:03:07.333 --> 00:03:08.543
but it turns out

00:03:09.585 --> 00:03:11.337
they plagiarized a colleague's work.

00:03:11.421 --> 00:03:16.175
So now I hear they're spending more time
in and out of court.

00:03:20.096 --> 00:03:21.514
Is that right?

00:03:22.515 --> 00:03:25.685
This is why you need expert evaluation.

00:03:49.667 --> 00:03:54.630
The director always asks me to evaluate
any paintings that people donate.

00:03:55.214 --> 00:03:59.344
But I must admit it puts me
in a difficult position at times.

00:03:59.427 --> 00:04:00.887
It also fails to honor the work.

00:04:02.055 --> 00:04:04.640
That's why I was like that earlier.

00:04:21.657 --> 00:04:25.578
Hey, babe. I'm just leaving campus now.
I'll head straight to the kindergarten.

00:04:26.204 --> 00:04:29.499
I might be a little late.
Could you let Sop and her teacher know?

00:04:30.333 --> 00:04:32.543
No, I'll be there soon. I called a taxi.

00:04:32.627 --> 00:04:34.670
Mr. Lee. Hello.

00:04:35.463 --> 00:04:37.590
Oh, hello.

00:04:37.673 --> 00:04:39.634
I'm sorry, but have we met?

00:04:41.761 --> 00:04:44.389
Yes. I'm Jin Young-in, a law professor.

00:04:44.472 --> 00:04:47.350
Director Kim introduced us
at the gallery opening.

00:04:47.433 --> 00:04:50.228
We talked about the Sokoboako painting.

00:04:50.311 --> 00:04:54.816
-Right. I see.
-I've been meaning to pay you a visit.

00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:57.985
I think
the director may have misunderstood

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:00.696
because of what you said
about Sokoboako that day.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:01.697
I'm sorry,

00:05:01.781 --> 00:05:03.866
but I'm running a little late. Sorry.

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.077
-But--
-Yeah, the taxi's here.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.425
You owe me an apology.

00:05:20.925 --> 00:05:25.054
Mr. Lee, the court just ruled
it wasn't plagiarism.

00:05:25.138 --> 00:05:27.390
-Of course you should apologize.
-Look--

00:05:27.473 --> 00:05:30.393
The director got me wrong
because of what you said.

00:05:30.476 --> 00:05:33.563
Is it really worth all these calls
and visits to argue about it?

00:05:33.646 --> 00:05:37.483
You also deliberately ignored
all my calls and texts, didn't you?

00:05:37.567 --> 00:05:39.360
-Oh man.
-Don't you think that's rude?

00:05:39.444 --> 00:05:42.655
-Of course you need to apologize--
-No. Don't ever call me again.

00:05:43.364 --> 00:05:44.449
Hello?

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:51.831
Honey.

00:06:04.594 --> 00:06:06.596
ARTIST LEE KI-DAE

00:06:18.566 --> 00:06:19.400
Hello?

00:06:19.484 --> 00:06:21.402
You'd better stop before I call the cops.

00:06:21.486 --> 00:06:22.653
"I'm sorry."

00:06:22.737 --> 00:06:24.155
That's all we need to hear--

00:06:24.655 --> 00:06:25.490
Hello?

00:06:36.876 --> 00:06:37.793
Su-yeon.

00:07:44.193 --> 00:07:46.070
Mr. Baek,
I think this is Ko Dong-uk's phone.

00:07:46.153 --> 00:07:47.780
GRANDPA, I'M LEAVING
DON'T LOOK FOR ME

00:07:47.863 --> 00:07:49.699
These are his messages with Ko Se-hun.

00:07:49.782 --> 00:07:51.492
WHO ARE YOU? WHY ARE YOU SENDING ME THIS?

00:07:51.576 --> 00:07:53.244
And these match the photos Ms. An sent us.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:54.954
Sir.

00:07:56.581 --> 00:07:57.832
Is anything missing?

00:07:58.916 --> 00:07:59.917
No.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.128
He had been

00:08:02.878 --> 00:08:04.547
blatantly provoking Ko Dong-uk.

00:08:05.047 --> 00:08:07.633
He would've seen a grieving man's rage
in court that day.

00:08:12.888 --> 00:08:17.018
But why didn't Ko Dong-uk ask anything,
even after getting these photos?

00:08:18.269 --> 00:08:20.605
He must've wanted to know
who sent it and why.

00:08:21.188 --> 00:08:22.440
He'd have been confused,

00:08:23.899 --> 00:08:24.734
making him

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.404
more fixated on what he could see.

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:37.997
-Ko Dong-uk's been taken to the hospital.
-Okay.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.249
Locate Mr. Jin Young-in.

00:08:40.333 --> 00:08:43.044
An Yun-su won't be far from them.

00:08:43.127 --> 00:08:44.170
Yes, sir.

00:08:45.838 --> 00:08:49.467
Detective Nam, run the plates
and track Jin Young-in's car down.

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:51.344
Detective Bae, get his home address.

00:08:52.011 --> 00:08:53.137
No, go there yourself.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:54.347
Yes, ma'am.

00:09:01.354 --> 00:09:02.730
I lied.

00:09:03.606 --> 00:09:05.441
There's no evidence in Ko Se-hun's case.

00:09:06.984 --> 00:09:09.070
If you knew it wouldn't hold up,

00:09:09.987 --> 00:09:11.155
why did you lie?

00:09:12.406 --> 00:09:13.824
It was bait.

00:09:14.867 --> 00:09:17.745
I know who it might be,
but I can't catch them on my own.

00:09:22.041 --> 00:09:23.209
You mean Mr. Jin?

00:09:26.545 --> 00:09:30.341
He sent you threatening messages,
pretending to be me

00:09:30.841 --> 00:09:33.678
on the day he visited me
at the detention center.

00:09:33.761 --> 00:09:35.680
I LET YOU OUT,
AND THIS IS WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING?

00:09:35.763 --> 00:09:37.932
Wait, that wasn't from you?

00:09:38.683 --> 00:09:41.644
I would've sent the same thing
if I had a phone.

00:09:42.728 --> 00:09:46.941
So you'd kill Ko Se-hun
without thinking twice.

00:09:49.694 --> 00:09:51.195
He couldn't have done this alone.

00:09:53.531 --> 00:09:55.074
His wife was always with him.

00:09:57.368 --> 00:09:59.870
What made you step up to defend me?

00:10:00.538 --> 00:10:01.997
It was my wife's suggestion.

00:10:02.081 --> 00:10:06.836
She said your confession gave someone
a chance to clear their name,

00:10:08.504 --> 00:10:10.381
and I agreed.

00:10:14.719 --> 00:10:16.095
There's a witness.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.306
A kid saw Ko Se-hun

00:10:20.307 --> 00:10:21.934
getting killed.

00:10:22.643 --> 00:10:24.395
I've already been to see him.

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:25.938
Who is it?

00:10:26.772 --> 00:10:27.606
What…

00:10:28.232 --> 00:10:30.192
what did he see and how?

00:10:33.821 --> 00:10:36.073
What the fuck? Let go of me!

00:10:36.157 --> 00:10:37.867
Who are you? Please don't kill me.

00:10:48.169 --> 00:10:49.920
You can hear me, can't you?

00:10:52.631 --> 00:10:53.466
Who killed

00:10:54.717 --> 00:10:55.926
Ko Se-hun?

00:10:58.512 --> 00:11:00.014
You know…

00:11:01.098 --> 00:11:01.932
Who?

00:11:03.267 --> 00:11:05.561
That art teacher who killed her husband.

00:11:08.063 --> 00:11:10.191
Consider this divine punishment.

00:11:15.446 --> 00:11:16.280
And then what?

00:11:17.948 --> 00:11:21.911
I was too scared to watch the rest.

00:11:25.206 --> 00:11:29.168
He had the full recording of that day.

00:11:29.251 --> 00:11:33.172
Fucking hell. I thought I was a goner.
That crazy bitch.

00:11:36.801 --> 00:11:38.928
Hey, just get ready to play.

00:11:39.595 --> 00:11:41.639
There's so much money at stake, damn it.

00:11:50.356 --> 00:11:52.149
Are you saying that's Jin?

00:11:52.983 --> 00:11:55.361
All that matters is that it's not you.

00:12:04.703 --> 00:12:06.372
Check the messages.

00:12:10.876 --> 00:12:12.795
It belonged to Se-hun.

00:12:18.133 --> 00:12:20.427
How did he know
to send them to this phone?

00:12:24.765 --> 00:12:25.599
Sir.

00:12:27.852 --> 00:12:30.521
Have you met this person before,
by any chance?

00:12:34.316 --> 00:12:36.402
He came to my house,

00:12:36.944 --> 00:12:40.030
not long after you and An Yun-su

00:12:40.865 --> 00:12:42.074
came by.

00:12:42.825 --> 00:12:44.451
What did you talk about?

00:12:44.535 --> 00:12:46.287
He said he was sorry.

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:50.541
He apologized as that woman's lawyer

00:12:51.458 --> 00:12:54.962
and said if he'd known about the deal
between the two women,

00:12:56.338 --> 00:12:58.841
Se-hun wouldn't have died.

00:13:02.553 --> 00:13:03.387
Yes?

00:13:05.848 --> 00:13:06.682
This woman.

00:13:08.517 --> 00:13:10.060
I've seen her before.

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:13.397
You must be waiting for your grandchild.

00:13:17.651 --> 00:13:21.322
I hear they're babies until they move out,
even if they're all grown up.

00:13:22.656 --> 00:13:26.285
Still, I hope
they take their time growing up.

00:13:36.587 --> 00:13:37.671
Are you

00:13:38.881 --> 00:13:41.050
trying to tell me

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:44.011
they're the ones who killed Se-hun?

00:13:45.179 --> 00:13:46.639
-Well, it's not--
-Yes.

00:13:49.391 --> 00:13:51.018
That's how I see it.

00:13:54.605 --> 00:13:57.107
That woman said the same thing earlier.

00:13:58.776 --> 00:14:00.527
That An Yun-su didn't do it.

00:14:03.739 --> 00:14:06.241
How did Jin get this video?

00:14:12.206 --> 00:14:13.248
Mr. Baek.

00:14:24.551 --> 00:14:25.678
Jang Jeong-gu speaking.

00:14:25.761 --> 00:14:27.179
It's me, An Yun-su.

00:14:29.807 --> 00:14:31.392
I just sent you a video.

00:14:31.475 --> 00:14:33.686
I got it, but where are you right now?

00:14:34.186 --> 00:14:37.064
It's CCTV footage
from the day Ko Se-hun was killed.

00:14:37.773 --> 00:14:39.483
If you watch it to the end,

00:14:39.566 --> 00:14:41.777
you'll see it wasn't me
but the real killer.

00:14:43.112 --> 00:14:44.446
Is it Jin Young-in?

00:14:48.409 --> 00:14:51.829
We saw him in a photo at the gallery
while we were tracking you down.

00:14:52.871 --> 00:14:54.665
It was the one with your husband.

00:14:55.416 --> 00:14:59.420
And you know the sketch of Choi Su-yeon
you left with Officer Bae?

00:15:00.379 --> 00:15:01.630
It's gone.

00:15:02.214 --> 00:15:03.799
You were right, Ms. An.

00:15:04.299 --> 00:15:07.636
So from now on, don't go it alone.
Work with us.

00:15:08.679 --> 00:15:10.389
There's something I have to check.

00:15:10.472 --> 00:15:12.558
I'll come find you once I know for sure.

00:15:12.641 --> 00:15:14.018
Ms. An.

00:16:00.397 --> 00:16:01.523
Ms. An.

00:16:04.985 --> 00:16:06.195
You scared me.

00:16:09.156 --> 00:16:10.866
I thought I got lucky.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.787
Still, if it weren't for you,

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:17.581
I never would've known
there were fingerprints on the plate.

00:16:18.082 --> 00:16:20.709
Ms. An, where's the plate?

00:16:23.879 --> 00:16:25.130
Put that down.

00:16:34.181 --> 00:16:35.182
That's right.

00:16:36.141 --> 00:16:38.936
I killed your husband.

00:16:39.937 --> 00:16:40.771
No.

00:16:42.856 --> 00:16:45.109
You're not the one I saw that day.

00:16:47.528 --> 00:16:48.612
It was your wife.

00:17:00.415 --> 00:17:02.042
What are you talking about?

00:17:02.126 --> 00:17:05.921
No! I was the one you saw that day!

00:17:10.926 --> 00:17:11.927
Your husband

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:15.264
was just so rude to us.

00:17:16.765 --> 00:17:18.684
You don't kill someone for being rude.

00:17:18.767 --> 00:17:20.894
And who gets to decide that?

00:17:20.978 --> 00:17:22.563
The victim does!

00:17:22.646 --> 00:17:23.939
Lee Ki-dae

00:17:24.731 --> 00:17:26.358
insulted us.

00:17:29.778 --> 00:17:33.031
This is all your fault!

00:17:33.115 --> 00:17:35.868
It could've just stayed buried,

00:17:35.951 --> 00:17:37.661
but you dug it all up!

00:17:37.744 --> 00:17:39.872
You have no right to blame anyone.

00:17:41.748 --> 00:17:45.460
The defendant, Mo, being tried
for the Dentist Couple Murder case,

00:17:45.544 --> 00:17:47.963
confessed to another murder
mid-trial in court.

00:17:48.463 --> 00:17:50.299
Only Mo remained calm

00:17:50.382 --> 00:17:54.094
in the shocked courtroom
as she continued her confession.

00:17:54.178 --> 00:17:56.513
-Due to the shock…
-I thought we got lucky.

00:17:56.597 --> 00:17:58.724
What on earth is going on?

00:18:01.101 --> 00:18:03.937
Meanwhile, the authorities said
nothing has been confirmed yet…

00:18:30.297 --> 00:18:31.757
-Honey.
-Yes?

00:18:35.344 --> 00:18:36.178
What is it?

00:18:37.304 --> 00:18:38.472
Give it to Ms. Mo.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:42.893
It's the little things that move people.

00:19:12.798 --> 00:19:14.007
So why?

00:19:14.091 --> 00:19:18.011
Why couldn't you kill Ko Se-hun?

00:19:18.095 --> 00:19:21.556
If you had kept your word,
it wouldn't have come to this.

00:19:22.266 --> 00:19:25.686
And Mo Eun should be thanking me.

00:19:25.769 --> 00:19:29.064
Because I was the one
who got revenge for her sister!

00:19:29.147 --> 00:19:32.401
I had to finish off what you couldn't
because you dragged your feet!

00:20:02.014 --> 00:20:03.181
Take it out.

00:20:16.278 --> 00:20:17.654
It's Jang's number.

00:20:32.127 --> 00:20:33.128
Damn it.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:37.049
You thought you were perfect, didn't you?

00:20:37.799 --> 00:20:42.012
Prosecutor Baek is probably watching
the original video right about now.

00:20:44.765 --> 00:20:47.225
How many times
do you think I've watched it?

00:20:47.309 --> 00:20:49.311
Dozens of times? Hundreds?

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:53.273
At least it'll become clear
that Ms. An isn't the killer.

00:20:56.109 --> 00:21:00.155
I'm well aware
that Prosecutor Baek suspects me.

00:21:01.448 --> 00:21:04.326
Like you said, Ms. An,
the problem I had with Lee Ki-dae

00:21:05.202 --> 00:21:07.245
wasn't something worth killing over.

00:21:13.377 --> 00:21:14.211
"I killed

00:21:14.961 --> 00:21:16.505
my husband."

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:19.841
"But I did not kill Ko Se-hun."

00:21:22.677 --> 00:21:26.139
What you said in your confession video
will now become the truth.

00:21:26.723 --> 00:21:29.184
You killed Lee Ki-dae,
just like you confessed.

00:21:29.684 --> 00:21:30.852
And Ko Se-hun

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.231
was murdered by someone Mo Eun sent!

00:21:50.664 --> 00:21:51.832
No!

00:21:53.166 --> 00:21:54.292
Don't do it.

00:21:54.376 --> 00:21:56.795
I'm going to try and make a deal

00:21:56.878 --> 00:21:58.296
with you too, Ms. An.

00:22:00.715 --> 00:22:03.009
Pour the etchant over the copperplate.

00:22:06.054 --> 00:22:07.305
Hurry up.

00:22:07.806 --> 00:22:10.100
Let's just get rid of those fingerprints

00:22:10.183 --> 00:22:12.686
so we can both finally have some peace!

00:22:13.395 --> 00:22:14.896
Just say Mo Eun framed you

00:22:15.522 --> 00:22:18.066
and made you confess as part of her plan.

00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:20.026
That's why you killed her too.

00:22:20.735 --> 00:22:21.862
You're crazy.

00:22:23.822 --> 00:22:24.781
I have to be.

00:22:25.407 --> 00:22:26.533
Look where we are now.

00:22:27.701 --> 00:22:28.785
So?

00:22:29.995 --> 00:22:31.538
Would it help you decide

00:22:32.164 --> 00:22:33.540
if I gave her a little stab?

00:22:33.623 --> 00:22:34.833
Stop!

00:22:34.916 --> 00:22:35.834
Stop it.

00:22:39.463 --> 00:22:40.297
Stop it.

00:23:11.536 --> 00:23:12.370
Good.

00:23:13.371 --> 00:23:14.372
Now

00:23:14.873 --> 00:23:17.125
kill her.

00:23:20.003 --> 00:23:21.713
Please stop this madness.

00:23:22.464 --> 00:23:24.299
I got rid of the fingerprints.

00:23:25.759 --> 00:23:26.718
I knew it.

00:23:27.219 --> 00:23:28.970
I knew you wouldn't be able to do it.

00:23:29.679 --> 00:23:31.139
My wife said it herself.

00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:33.850
That's the kind of person An Yun-su is.

00:23:36.436 --> 00:23:37.646
You're only human.

00:23:40.315 --> 00:23:41.816
You asked me

00:23:42.567 --> 00:23:44.986
why I was helping you.

00:23:49.199 --> 00:23:53.954
I wanted to make things right
for what I did.

00:23:54.496 --> 00:23:55.539
That's all.

00:23:57.707 --> 00:23:59.042
Even though I don't,

00:24:00.835 --> 00:24:02.921
you have a place to go back to.

00:24:08.218 --> 00:24:09.094
What are you doing?

00:24:15.183 --> 00:24:17.477
Jang, I didn't do this!

00:24:17.561 --> 00:24:19.354
This crazy bitch did it to herself!

00:24:19.437 --> 00:24:21.523
-Leave the knife!
-She did this to herself!

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:25.110
Ms. An!

00:25:08.069 --> 00:25:09.904
No…

00:25:15.702 --> 00:25:16.911
Why did you do it?

00:25:19.539 --> 00:25:20.415
Why…

00:25:26.546 --> 00:25:27.714
Why…

00:25:32.052 --> 00:25:33.053
Why did you…

00:26:35.657 --> 00:26:36.491
Slowly.

00:26:49.045 --> 00:26:50.422
Fucking hell.

00:26:50.922 --> 00:26:53.967
I thought I was a goner. That crazy bitch.

00:26:56.302 --> 00:26:57.262
My phone.

00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:16.823
For fuck's sake.

00:27:26.082 --> 00:27:26.916
Hey.

00:27:27.417 --> 00:27:30.754
I nearly died just now. For real.

00:27:31.796 --> 00:27:33.089
WHAT THE HELL? JUST HURRY

00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:39.471
A CRAZY BITCH
TRIED TO STAB ME WITH A KNIFE

00:27:39.554 --> 00:27:42.015
CUT THE CRAP. YOU'RE CARRYING THIS ROUND.
IT'S COMING!

00:27:42.098 --> 00:27:44.517
These jerks won't believe me.

00:27:46.561 --> 00:27:47.562
Hey.

00:27:48.438 --> 00:27:50.774
Whatever. Just get ready to play.

00:27:51.649 --> 00:27:53.485
There's so much money at stake.

00:27:57.155 --> 00:27:57.989
Hey.

00:27:58.615 --> 00:28:00.575
Today's game is a huge deal, okay?

00:28:02.869 --> 00:28:04.662
Yeah, I'll take the hammer.

00:29:29.789 --> 00:29:30.623
EXHIBIT NO. 5

00:29:30.707 --> 00:29:33.251
CRIME SCENE CCTV (OCT 7, 2022)
SUBMITTED TO PROSECUTION

00:29:33.334 --> 00:29:34.335
Counsel.

00:29:34.961 --> 00:29:36.212
Present your case.

00:29:43.803 --> 00:29:45.722
Where did it all go wrong?

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:49.601
On April 15th, 2022,

00:29:51.102 --> 00:29:53.730
when Lee Ki-dae,
the defendant's husband, was murdered,

00:29:55.189 --> 00:29:57.317
the defendant arrived at the scene,

00:29:58.151 --> 00:30:01.154
found him dying,
and made an emergency call.

00:30:01.237 --> 00:30:04.741
That was the moment her tragedy began.

00:30:07.285 --> 00:30:09.078
In the detention center,

00:30:09.662 --> 00:30:11.497
she made a deal with a murderer,

00:30:12.665 --> 00:30:15.793
knowing how wrong and terrible it was,

00:30:17.295 --> 00:30:20.381
because it was the only path she had.

00:30:22.342 --> 00:30:23.760
If she hadn't taken it,

00:30:25.053 --> 00:30:26.888
she never would've had this chance.

00:30:30.183 --> 00:30:33.603
An Yun-su is not just a victim

00:30:34.103 --> 00:30:35.813
but a survivor of this case.

00:30:36.814 --> 00:30:38.232
She is a survivor

00:30:38.316 --> 00:30:41.778
who fought to reclaim her life
and her little girl.

00:30:43.738 --> 00:30:44.572
Now, then,

00:30:46.199 --> 00:30:47.492
I ask again.

00:30:48.576 --> 00:30:50.578
Where did it all go wrong?

00:30:51.371 --> 00:30:53.414
If that wrong could be made right,

00:30:54.791 --> 00:30:57.251
could her life go back to the way it was?

00:31:01.255 --> 00:31:02.799
Nevertheless,

00:31:03.841 --> 00:31:05.885
I can only hope that it will.

00:31:08.096 --> 00:31:09.138
I rest my case.

00:31:11.975 --> 00:31:15.937
Regarding the charges of murder
and related offenses against An Yun-su,

00:31:16.562 --> 00:31:18.147
the court issues this judgment.

00:31:19.732 --> 00:31:23.277
On the principal charge
of murdering Lee Ki-dae,

00:31:23.361 --> 00:31:24.904
the court finds the defendant,

00:31:25.405 --> 00:31:26.906
An Yun-su, not guilty.

00:31:30.576 --> 00:31:33.997
On the related charges,
the court issues the following judgment.

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:36.874
Attempted murder
under Article 25 of the Criminal Act,

00:31:37.375 --> 00:31:38.209
guilty.

00:31:39.002 --> 00:31:41.254
Preparation and conspiracy
to commit murder

00:31:41.838 --> 00:31:43.715
under Article 255, guilty.

00:31:44.424 --> 00:31:49.012
Unlawful confinement
under Article 276, guilty.

00:31:49.512 --> 00:31:52.765
Therefore, the court sentences An Yun-su

00:31:53.891 --> 00:31:57.228
to two years' imprisonment,
suspended for three years.

00:31:58.396 --> 00:32:00.690
The reason for this sentence
is as follows.

00:32:00.773 --> 00:32:04.110
In particular, in relation to the charges
of attempted murder

00:32:04.193 --> 00:32:05.737
and unlawful confinement,

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:09.782
the court has taken into account
the petition from the victim's family

00:32:10.283 --> 00:32:11.534
in reducing the sentence.

00:32:19.625 --> 00:32:20.877
It's a petition.

00:32:24.881 --> 00:32:26.257
If

00:32:27.925 --> 00:32:30.553
Se-hun had admitted to what he did wrong

00:32:31.262 --> 00:32:33.306
and been properly punished…

00:32:36.059 --> 00:32:37.894
what do you think would've happened?

00:32:38.811 --> 00:32:39.937
If he had,

00:32:41.147 --> 00:32:44.275
things would have turned out differently.

00:32:46.944 --> 00:32:48.154
If he had, that is.

00:32:52.075 --> 00:32:53.826
During the investigation…

00:32:56.496 --> 00:32:58.956
there were times when I thought

00:32:59.791 --> 00:33:01.876
An Yun-su might not be the killer.

00:33:02.919 --> 00:33:04.712
Each time, I buried that thought.

00:33:05.838 --> 00:33:08.633
I made the victims' deaths
my justification

00:33:09.217 --> 00:33:11.219
and used my shallow sense of justice

00:33:11.844 --> 00:33:13.554
as a prosecutor as an excuse…

00:33:16.057 --> 00:33:18.935
to push myself
to believe only what I could see.

00:33:22.355 --> 00:33:24.023
When I should've hesitated…

00:33:26.025 --> 00:33:27.401
I only became more fixated.

00:33:31.114 --> 00:33:34.742
So, even though I knew your rage
from losing your family was dangerous…

00:33:36.953 --> 00:33:38.121
I ignored it.

00:33:40.498 --> 00:33:42.375
An Yun-su had to come first.

00:33:45.128 --> 00:33:48.089
I'm going to set things right now. I will.

00:33:49.048 --> 00:33:50.091
As I should.

00:33:50.174 --> 00:33:51.300
Ms. An.

00:33:53.386 --> 00:33:55.805
You may go home now.

00:34:56.949 --> 00:34:59.994
I'd like to point out one thing
about this piece.

00:35:00.077 --> 00:35:01.913
It has fingerprints on it.

00:35:02.455 --> 00:35:03.623
-Fingerprints?
-Yes.

00:35:03.706 --> 00:35:06.125
Since it's a posthumous work,

00:35:06.209 --> 00:35:08.419
we printed the original plate as is.

00:35:08.502 --> 00:35:10.755
We thought it was meaningful in itself.

00:35:12.423 --> 00:35:13.549
I see.

00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:16.135
We only made one print.

00:35:16.802 --> 00:35:19.513
It's a mono edition,
unusual in copperplate printmaking.

00:35:19.597 --> 00:35:21.140
It's certainly worth collecting.

00:35:23.267 --> 00:35:24.560
Was the original destroyed?

00:35:25.186 --> 00:35:28.272
No, the original plate
is in the artist's studio.

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:31.817
But please don't worry.

00:35:32.401 --> 00:35:34.445
No more prints will be made.

00:35:35.738 --> 00:35:37.114
I should hope not.

00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:03.808
You might think
you got rid of all the evidence.

00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:05.226
But no.

00:36:05.309 --> 00:36:07.436
There was a test print.

00:36:08.229 --> 00:36:09.230
Here.

00:36:09.814 --> 00:36:11.274
The fingerprint is on it too.

00:36:13.734 --> 00:36:15.319
Is that my fingerprint?

00:36:16.362 --> 00:36:17.238
Yes.

00:36:17.863 --> 00:36:19.365
It's yours, Ms. Choi.

00:36:26.831 --> 00:36:28.374
You're not wearing your watch.

00:36:29.458 --> 00:36:31.294
I heard it meant a lot to you.

00:36:32.503 --> 00:36:33.629
When my husband

00:36:34.255 --> 00:36:36.048
was appointed as a professor,

00:36:36.632 --> 00:36:39.051
we gifted each other those watches.

00:36:42.179 --> 00:36:43.639
When I laid him to rest…

00:36:47.601 --> 00:36:49.353
I buried it with him at sea.

00:36:54.567 --> 00:36:55.901
Did you

00:36:56.610 --> 00:36:57.778
kill Lee Ki-dae?

00:37:06.912 --> 00:37:07.747
No.

00:37:11.167 --> 00:37:12.710
My husband did.

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:22.928
It happened so fast.
I didn't even have time to stop him.

00:37:24.597 --> 00:37:26.265
By the time I turned around,

00:37:27.058 --> 00:37:29.352
my husband already had a knife
in his hand.

00:37:45.368 --> 00:37:46.744
Su-yeon.

00:38:44.427 --> 00:38:46.887
He was just so rude to you.

00:38:56.605 --> 00:38:57.440
Honey.

00:38:59.316 --> 00:39:01.277
It's okay.

00:39:17.751 --> 00:39:20.880
I'll take care of things here.
You go ahead.

00:39:24.884 --> 00:39:26.218
I'm fine.

00:39:26.302 --> 00:39:29.472
Yeah, you're fine. Don't worry, all right?

00:39:29.972 --> 00:39:32.933
I'll clean this up quickly
and be right behind you.

00:39:33.976 --> 00:39:35.102
It's okay.

00:39:35.895 --> 00:39:36.896
Yeah, it's okay.

00:39:56.749 --> 00:39:59.084
Just how long has he etched
those copperplates?

00:40:02.838 --> 00:40:04.965
He's breathing, but he's not…

00:40:05.049 --> 00:40:06.592
Ki-dae, look at me.

00:40:07.551 --> 00:40:09.178
Ki-dae, open your eyes.

00:40:09.970 --> 00:40:10.971
Don't close your eyes.

00:40:11.889 --> 00:40:13.974
Please don't leave us, Ki-dae.

00:40:15.809 --> 00:40:16.644
Ki-dae.

00:40:17.144 --> 00:40:19.647
Please hurry!

00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:21.565
I know it wasn't right,

00:40:23.442 --> 00:40:25.986
but I couldn't turn my husband in.

00:40:30.199 --> 00:40:32.368
Because I could understand him.

00:40:38.916 --> 00:40:40.084
Ms. Choi.

00:40:40.167 --> 00:40:43.087
As of now, you are suspected
of being an accomplice

00:40:43.170 --> 00:40:45.214
in the murders
of Lee Ki-dae and Ko Se-hun.

00:40:45.923 --> 00:40:47.383
We'll have to argue it in court,

00:40:48.384 --> 00:40:52.680
but there's substantial evidence
indicating that you killed Lee Ki-dae.

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:00.980
I suppose…

00:41:03.274 --> 00:41:06.193
this kind of suspicion
is how it all started for An Yun-su.

00:41:16.036 --> 00:41:18.872
You have the right to an attorney
and to remain silent.

00:41:46.609 --> 00:41:52.072
O dear Moon, please give us rice and curry

00:41:52.156 --> 00:41:55.284
Give us a bronze bracelet
For my baby sister to wear…

00:41:55.367 --> 00:41:57.661
-Sop, are you happy?
-I am!

00:41:57.745 --> 00:42:03.292
Give us an elephant and a horse
For my baby sister to ride on

00:42:03.375 --> 00:42:08.672
Give us a chair
For my baby sister to sit on

00:42:08.756 --> 00:42:14.136
Give us a bed and a sofa
For my baby sister to sleep on

00:42:14.219 --> 00:42:19.642
Give us a play for my baby sister to watch

00:42:19.725 --> 00:42:25.105
Give us Grandma Choo
Who can take care of my baby sister

00:42:25.189 --> 00:42:30.277
Give us Grandma Gert
Who can take care of me…

00:42:48.587 --> 00:42:49.672
Sop, you can hop out.

00:42:53.967 --> 00:42:55.302
Say hello to your friends.

00:42:55.886 --> 00:42:57.304
Hello.

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:49.189
I wanted to make things right
for what I did.

00:43:50.816 --> 00:43:52.359
Even though I don't,

00:43:53.610 --> 00:43:55.821
you have a place to go back to.

00:44:00.993 --> 00:44:03.829
Should we give this watch back to Eun?

00:44:03.912 --> 00:44:04.997
Yes.

00:44:07.583 --> 00:44:09.168
Why don't you hang it up?

00:44:14.339 --> 00:44:15.799
Well done.

00:44:24.099 --> 00:44:25.100
Let's go.

00:45:36.421 --> 00:45:38.382
Are you going to catch it?

00:45:39.675 --> 00:45:40.509
Three!

00:45:42.719 --> 00:45:45.180
Kiss!

00:45:45.264 --> 00:45:47.266
-What's going on?
-What are they doing?

00:45:47.349 --> 00:45:48.350
It looks like a wedding.

00:45:50.352 --> 00:45:52.187
-It's so pretty.
-Wow.

00:45:53.063 --> 00:45:54.231
Thank you.

00:45:55.524 --> 00:45:56.859
Thank you!

00:45:58.610 --> 00:45:59.945
You can come in!

00:46:04.241 --> 00:46:06.076
This is so nice, isn't it?

00:46:07.035 --> 00:46:07.911
How pretty.

00:46:08.412 --> 00:46:09.413
Congratulations!

00:46:10.038 --> 00:46:13.584
-Thanks. We'll be happy together!
-You should get married like this someday.

00:46:15.377 --> 00:46:16.211
Let's go.

00:46:19.047 --> 00:46:20.924
Thank you!

00:50:16.618 --> 00:50:21.623
