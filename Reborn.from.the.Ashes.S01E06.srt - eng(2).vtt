[Reborn from the Ashes]

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.440
[Episode 6]

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.480
And yet, you and I remain
so ambiguous.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:16.330
I'm afraid that's not appropriate.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.510
Appropriate or not,

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:27.630
it's up to me.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.480
There is really a spear on his chest.
I wasn't mistaken.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.230
Isn't Wanyan Qi the only son

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.510
of Prince Zhenbei's Mansion?

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.150
Wanyan Jin is the eldest son
whom Prince Zhenbei has just found.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.840
Prince Zhenbei valued him greatly

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.990
and had just appointed him
as the heir apparent.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.630
Before, I was wondering

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.880
why he didn't confer the title
upon Wanyan Qi.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:53.920
Who would know he has another son?

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.110
But Wanyan Qi has been frail and sickly
since his childhood,

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.200
and his days are numbered.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.000
If it were me,

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.770
I wouldn't appoint him
as the heir either.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.190
Bah, bah, bah!

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.960
Look at my big mouth.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.830
If you marry him,

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.130
Young Master Qi will surely
be blessed with great fortune

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.290
and live a few years longer.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:10.840
It is not necessary.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.480
Cuihua,

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:18.540
I'm feeling a bit hungry.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.330
Go fetch something to eat
from the kitchen.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.770
Right away.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.960
It's truly an honor
to have you to be here.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.320
This isn't the place for conversation.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.840
Please follow me to the study room.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.670
[Execution ground]
Governor Wen's daughter

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.630
got married yesterday.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.330
Why does she beat the drum here today?

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.190
So this is that ugly bride
from the Wanyan Family.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.920
I, Wen Yueqian, have been wronged.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.070
My father, Governor Wen Muchen of
Yunzhou City,

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.320
has always been loyal to the Emperor.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.840
I beg you to see the truth.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.400
The Prince has arrived.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.190
Father, Father!

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.700
My father has been wrongfully accused.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:57.840
He is not such a cruel man.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.000
Please, spare him.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.770
Don't cause a scene.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.000
This is the execution ground.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.630
My father has been wrongfully accused.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.670
Let me go!

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.590
Father.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.840
Qian.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.150
My father has spent his life

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.550
serving the country and its people,

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:11.630
dutiful and loyal.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.670
He would never harm the soldiers
of the Qilin Army.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.590
I beg you to investigate thoroughly.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.710
Give my father back his honor.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.480
Even if you are a daughter-in-law
of the Wanyan Family,

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:22.360
I

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.710
will never bend the law
for personal gain.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.810
It is a fact that the criminal
Wen Muchen

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.400
poisoned the soldiers of the Qilin Army,

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:30.800
and his crime is beyond pardon.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.650
Carry out the execution.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.510
Live well.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.510
No!

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.440
I might as well tell you

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.670
the crime your father committed
against the Qilin Army

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.510
was orchestrated by my father.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.190
Lord Su,

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.840
now that you have been the Governor,

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.400
you must surely know

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.360
what you should

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.320
and should not do, right?

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.710
Just don't end up like Wen Muchen,
that clueless fool.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.400
He discovered my military payroll fraud,

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.760
secretly copied the account book,

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.360
and even planned to deliver it
to the Emperor.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.110
The account book has been dealt with,
right?

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:40.840
Please rest assured, Your Highness.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.150
You ordered me to poison the wine
Wen Muchen gave the Qilin Army.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.630
Everyone thought Wen Muchen
had poisoned the Qilin Army.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:52.550
It turns out

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.670
you killed my father
over the account book.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.230
I will make you suffer eternal ruin.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.920
I naturally trust you.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.630
Once our two families unite by marriage,

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.360
we will be family.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.190
Thank you for your kindness,
Your Highness.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.760
Bah!

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:21.760
Such an old fox.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.230
Luckily, I held back after
intercepting the account book last time.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.230
If I can find that account book,

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.630
my father's name can finally be cleared.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.710
Only then will those evildoers

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.880
get the punishment they deserve.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.400
[Half a month later]

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:47.920
Gong Shixian.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.840
The beast who killed Zhijin

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.400
is now at the Su Family.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.960
I will play along with this.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:07.440
Sorry,

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:08.360
Shixian.

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.820
No trouble at all.

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:11.110
It's so late.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.660
Where are you heading, Qingran?

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:13.980
Grandmother has asked for me

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.960
to have a talk.

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:16.670
Once you're done with it,

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.480
why not join me in my room for a drink?

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.030
None of you

00:05:26.031 --> 00:05:32.855
(Watch on www.dramacool.club Support Admin)

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.550
are getting away.

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:33.230
What a beauty.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.150
I need to find a way

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.630
to get her.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.630
What exactly has happened

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.230
to make you

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:57.630
so sad?

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.320
Greetings, Shixian.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.400
Shixian,

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.320
in a few days,

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.160
I'll marry the second young master
of Prince Zhenbei's Mansion.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.760
But his health is fragile,

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.110
and his days are numbered.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.760
If I marry him,

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:29.280
I'm afraid

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.880
it won't be long
before I become a widow.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.030
Besides,

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.670
he's not the one I truly care for.

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:44.030
Then,

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:45.590
who is the one

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:47.030
you fancy?

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:58.480
If you don't want to marry,

00:06:58.630 --> 00:06:59.190
why not

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:00.710
let me take you away?

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:02.630
From now on,

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.280
you can live a life as you wish.

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:06.960
How does that sound?

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.000
No,

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.630
I can't bring trouble to you.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:12.400
Just take what I said today

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:14.110
as nonsense.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.840
This girl is so beautiful.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.710
Marrying Wanyan Qi, that sickly one,

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.000
really is a shame.

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:56.670
It's rare she has feelings for me.

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:59.000
Why not take her away from Yunzhou City?

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:01.000
When I'm tired of her someday,

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.920
I'll sell her to a brothel.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:05.480
No one will know it was me.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.000
Yi,

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.880
you'll belong to me forever tomorrow.

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:12.440
Young Master.

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:14.880
Have you prepared everything
I asked for?

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:16.370
Rest assured, Young Master.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.180
[Zimo, Guard]

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:17.830
All is arranged.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:18.800
Good.

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:22.430
Tomorrow, I will give Yi
a proper wedding celebration.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.960
What Yi? Aren't you marrying Su Qingran?

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.270
Since when did Su Qingran
become the eldest daughter?

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:35.110
I've heard that Miss Qingran

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:37.160
was raised in the countryside
for over ten years.

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:39.430
Not long ago, she was brought back
to the Su Mansion.

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:41.310
That's wrong, all wrong.

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:43.640
The one I married is Yi, not Su Qingran.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:46.270
Where's my father? I must find him.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.310
I want to call off this marriage.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.270
Young Master, it's too late now.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.800
You'll officially marry Miss Qingran
tomorrow.

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:55.520
The Prince definitely won't agree
to cancel it now.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.270
Young Master, you'd better

00:08:58.270 --> 00:08:59.760
wait quietly to marry the bride.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.390
I would never betray you
by marrying another woman.

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:07.000
I want to run away.

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:10.350
Ah!

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.190
Jin,

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.520
the few tasks I assigned to you recently
were handled quite well,

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:19.070
especially the case of the firearms
in the Begonia House.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.030
I really didn't misjudge you.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.800
It is worth it to name you
the crown prince.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:26.430
Father, you flatter me.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.600
It's all thanks to your wise guidance.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:31.110
Your Highness,

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:34.310
this medicinal cuisine
was specially prepared for you.

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:36.680
You're too thoughtful.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:38.950
Your Highness, something's wrong.

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:40.560
Young Master Qi has run away.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:42.470
What?

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.430
How could Qi run away?

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.110
Hmph!

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.370
This is all because you spoiled him.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:48.680
Now,

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.720
we should focus on what to do next.

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:52.350
Can we

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:54.350
delay the wedding date?

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:55.070
Delay?

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:58.350
If no one from our family
goes to pick up the bride today,

00:09:58.760 --> 00:09:59.470
then tomorrow,

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.430
the whole Yunzhou City will be buzzing
with gossip.

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:03.840
Father,

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:06.680
we absolutely can't let others
mock the Wanyan family.

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:09.070
I am willing to marry Miss Su
as my wife.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.640
That's actually a pretty good idea.

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:13.600
As long as it's a marriage
with the Su Family,

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:15.210
who marries her doesn't really matter.

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:17.800
Jin,

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:20.560
are you really willing to marry Miss Su?

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.070
To help you ease your worries

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:25.470
is my greatest honor.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.160
[Su Mansion]

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.720
Such grandeur.

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:38.720
The groom is truly handsome.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:43.720
Your Highness,

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:45.760
why have you come
to pick up the bride instead?

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:48.760
I'm not here to pick her up.
I'm here to marry her.

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:55.560
Marry her?

00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:59.310
You're going to marry Su Qingran
as your wife?

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:00.390
Is there a problem

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:02.000
with that?

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:04.640
Of course not.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.390
Your Highness, you must be joking.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.680
It is a blessing for us
that my daughter can marry you.

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:12.640
How did the groom end up
becoming the crown prince?

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:14.350
If she marries the crown prince,

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.190
how could Feiyi and I

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.470
ever have good days again?

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.350
I am here.
