(Old Bookshop)

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.120
We shouldn't stay here long.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.239
Let's talk somewhere else.

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:38.879
Go.

00:01:40.879 --> 00:01:41.680
Your Highness.

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.159
I heard news
inside Gan Sheng's residence.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.439
They're setting a trap
to capture Mr. Qingya alive.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.359
I see.

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:53.040
Thank you.

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:55.120
It's dangerous for you there.

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:56.560
Be careful.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:57.840
You have shown me great kindness.

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:59.040
If I can serve you,

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:00.519
I'm willing to give my life.

00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:02.560
Mr. Qingya.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.290
The one who sent the letter
wasn't the bookseller, but Gan Sheng.

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:07.159
He set this trap

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:09.719
to ensnare you
and force you into his service.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:10.719
That's why

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.800
I had to

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.680
intercept you on the route
he knew you'd take.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.080
Everyone knows

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.680
your relationship with General Gan

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:20.719
is far from ordinary.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.960
If that's the case,

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.360
why ruin his plan

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.120
and help me?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.520
If I hadn't used the bookseller as bait,

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.199
you wouldn't have
exposed your whereabouts

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:33.159
and gotten in danger.

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:34.759
It started because of me.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.000
I should take responsibility.

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:38.520
If General Gan finds out about this,

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.240
will it implicate you?

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:45.240
You seem concerned
about my relationship with him.

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.000
What if

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.759
I do get implicated,

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:53.400
will you help me?

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.840
If you have a conflict with General Gan,

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.680
I'll help you.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.240
Consider it repaying today's favor.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.639
But

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.919
I'd rather you stay alive

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.039
and live freely.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.000
Why?

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.919
Because

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.080
you saved my life.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.879
Five years in Beijiang,

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:31.879
surrounded by ice and frost.

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:34.599
It helped me survive.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.719
Just because
my play script encouraged you.

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.400
How does that count as saving your life?

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.199
(Five Years Ago, Beijiang Military Camp)

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.800
This is

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.000
Jing's Princess Royal.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.520
Look at her.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.479
That face

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:57.520
and that waist.

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:59.000
Do you like her?

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:04.599
Come on, drink up.

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:06.000
Drink. Here.

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:11.400
Someone who doesn't care about living

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:13.080
won't fear you.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.719
Even if I die,

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:18.879
I'll drag you down with me.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.240
Princess or not,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.480
you're still our spoils of war.

Live.

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:35.000
I must live.

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:41.800
Back then,

00:05:43.079 --> 00:05:44.560
I had already accepted death.

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:46.480
I was only

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.079
waiting for the right moment.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.879
If I hadn't heard that play,

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.959
the person standing before you now

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:56.759
would be a wandering soul.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.720
You killed my mentor

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.399
for revenge.

00:06:10.519 --> 00:06:12.160
Did he not deserve to die?

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.800
I suffered so much in Beijiang
these past five years.

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:17.319
If not for hatred,
I wouldn't have survived until now.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.480
Liu Zhen was tied to it all.

(Which one is the real you?)

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:25.560
So

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.759
how is that not saving my life?

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:34.160
Whatever it is...

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.439
Thank you

00:06:37.959 --> 00:06:39.480
for helping me today.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.399
I won't forget

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:43.800
this kindness.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.560
You just said

00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:50.120
you owe me a favor.

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:51.879
Don't forget it.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.920
Thank you for the trouble.

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.660
(To General Gan)

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.000
Mr. Qingya.

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:49.120
Tonight's plan
was ruined by Princess Royal.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.639
Looks like

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.560
you'll have to meet
General Gan tomorrow instead.

00:07:56.639 --> 00:07:58.260
Since you've
already prepared a fallback,

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.000
why are you

00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:01.439
still uneasy?

00:08:05.199 --> 00:08:06.480
Planning is easy.

00:08:08.319 --> 00:08:09.600
People's hearts are not.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:13.519
When you were teaching
me to play chess today,

00:08:13.879 --> 00:08:15.399
you said those in the game are blind,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.639
only by stepping outside it

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.240
can one see the whole board.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.040
Maybe the same applies

00:08:23.319 --> 00:08:24.959
when judging a person.

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:40.720
Seeing Mr. Qingya

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.799
is truly difficult.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.799
You suffered last night.

00:08:48.879 --> 00:08:49.679
Please.

00:08:51.919 --> 00:08:53.480
What's the meaning of this?

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.720
The place was surrounded
by elite soldiers last night.

00:08:56.799 --> 00:08:58.320
An inescapable trap.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.279
Tell me.

00:09:01.039 --> 00:09:02.919
Did you take me for a guest

00:09:03.639 --> 00:09:04.840
or a fugitive?

00:09:05.799 --> 00:09:06.600
In other words,

00:09:07.879 --> 00:09:09.000
you went there after all.

00:09:10.039 --> 00:09:12.279
But seeing how you treated me,

00:09:13.039 --> 00:09:14.159
I changed my mind.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.639
My men acted on their own.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.639
I only wanted to keep you safe.

00:09:19.799 --> 00:09:20.679
I didn't expect

00:09:21.399 --> 00:09:23.200
to make you misunderstand instead.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.559
Are the men
you replaced in this courtyard

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.000
also here to "protect" me?

00:09:33.919 --> 00:09:34.720
Indeed.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.120
I value you the most.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.039
Your safety

00:09:40.159 --> 00:09:41.679
naturally comes first.

00:09:42.919 --> 00:09:45.360
I imagine you act the same way in court.

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:47.360
Even though this capital

00:09:48.039 --> 00:09:50.039
is already in your control,

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.440
you're still troubled.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.679
These civil officials

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.679
would rather die than yield.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.759
You truly are a hidden talent.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:02.990
Living in a humble room,
yet seeing the whole world.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.840
Admirable.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.960
Seeing you like this,

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.399
I already understand

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.159
why the army fund reform

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.200
still hasn't been implemented.

00:10:18.279 --> 00:10:19.360
Please

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.320
enlighten me.

00:10:24.399 --> 00:10:27.240
World affairs should be handled
with openness, not with obstruction.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.799
The civil officials

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.720
are just a bunch of lousy scholars.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.440
Even if they shout the loudest,

00:10:33.759 --> 00:10:34.759
so what?

00:10:35.519 --> 00:10:36.639
What truly matters

00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:38.960
is prying at the noble clans.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.519
If you want profit,

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.679
you must

00:10:44.679 --> 00:10:46.100
(List of Noble Clans)

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.799
give some to them first.

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:57.580
(Suzhou Huang, Longxi Zheng,
Sichuan Shen, Hedong Pei)

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.080
Good.

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:01.519
Good.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:03.600
Excellent.
