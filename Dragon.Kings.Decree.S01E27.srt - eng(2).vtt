=Episode 27=

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.480
(War God's Hall)

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:20.099
What's going on?

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.060
Chu Moshang,

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:29.539
you're back.

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:34.379
It's the Dragon God.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.819
He passed on his power to me.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.058
It seems even the Dragon God
and the Wujing Saintess already know

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:42.180
that there's no need

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.259
for a vow between us.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.900
(War God's Hall)

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.500
What just happened?

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:19.099
I sense the Young Master.

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:21.220
He must've found a way to save himself.

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:22.099
Let's go.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.618
(Demons of the nether realm
may not hurt me people.)

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:29.739
(If possible,)

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.419
(I really wish I could be like you)

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.300
(and live for millennia,)

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:35.459
(protecting this land)

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.259
(and all we cherish.)

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.498
(Human lives are short,)

00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:42.019
(but our children will)

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.580
(protect the mortal realm, the sanctuary
and all living beings)

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.060
(in our place.)

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:49.378
(Dragons, heed my command.)

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:51.938
(Should the mortal realm
and the sanctuary face disaster again,)

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:53.579
(the Dragons must find a human)

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.459
(just like the Wujing Saintess.)

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:57.818
(Trust in each other.)

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:59.340
(Fight as one.)

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:03.580
(Only then can you protect
all life in the world.)

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:10.539
So the Dragon God
and the first Wujing Saintess

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.419
weren't just friends

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:13.419
or comrade-in-arms.

00:04:13.779 --> 00:04:14.900
They were also lovers.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.299
That's why the Dragon God
and the Wujing Saintess

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:19.778
didn't just marry each other

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:21.299
but also saved all life.

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:22.499
Zhilou, this means

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.099
you are my true Wujing Saintess.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.579
You guided me

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.940
to the true Dragon King's Decree.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.920
(Heaven-Earth Hall)

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.859
Li Yan,

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.659
we've summoned Zhilou,

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.338
but now we've been kept out.

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:44.859
Zhilou is still inside.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:46.619
It seems

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.659
we can only stall for time.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.900
(Heaven-Earth Hall)

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:06.460
Oh.

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:08.939
What happened today?

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.340
The Young Lord who always
looked down on me

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.580
would actually wait
outside War God's Hall for me.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.098
You're leaving for the sanctuary.

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:17.179
As your brother,

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:18.780
I have to see you off.

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:20.859
That's more like it.

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:24.338
A wise man goes with the flow.

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:26.338
Once I've married into the sanctuary,

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:28.539
I won't neglect Wujing.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.820
You'll still have to rely on me then.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.059
You're not the Dragon Queen yet,
and you've locked up Mother,

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.739
isolating her in Longevity Hall.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.260
How can we place our hope

00:05:39.299 --> 00:05:41.059
in Your Highness' modest care?

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.059
Mother doesn't want to leave her rooms

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.619
because she doesn't want
to see other people.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.940
Yes.

00:05:47.299 --> 00:05:49.780
She won't even show up
for such an important event.

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:51.820
She has always been so strong
and ambitious.

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.900
She has certainly gone all out

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.418
so you can enter the sanctuary.

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:56.819
Do you still want to stop me

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.380
from meeting those of the sanctuary?

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.340
Don't forget,

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.260
Young Lord.

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:04.778
You've no right to meddle.

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:06.499
You speak as though you do.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.099
I am the Wujing Saintess.

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:10.739
Who would dare stop me
from being crowned today?

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:12.499
Men!

00:06:29.859 --> 00:06:31.260
Feng Zhilou?

00:06:31.299 --> 00:06:32.539
Why are you here?

00:06:32.859 --> 00:06:34.140
Where do you think

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:35.900
we should be instead?

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:39.900
That's true.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.220
How do your fates concern me?

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:44.738
Today,

00:06:44.739 --> 00:06:48.019
Nie Rongzhi is going to deliver to me
the Wujing Saintess' battle robe

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.419
and crown me queen.

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.738
Prince Zhi has arrived

00:06:51.739 --> 00:06:54.380
with the battle robe
for the Wujing Saintess!

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:05.739
Feng Zhilou?

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.539
Moshang?

00:07:11.099 --> 00:07:13.299
Do you think you can change anything

00:07:13.539 --> 00:07:15.220
by showing up now?

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.499
Are you that afraid
that something might go wrong?

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.619
Moshang, every time you appear,

00:07:20.859 --> 00:07:23.139
it's always such a surprise.

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:25.739
Congratulations, Young Master,
on overcoming death.

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:26.778
This is great!

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:28.298
If His Majesty knows of this,

00:07:28.299 --> 00:07:29.780
he'd be overjoyed.

00:07:29.979 --> 00:07:30.978
Young Master,

00:07:30.979 --> 00:07:33.460
we're here on the Dragon King's orders

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.338
to deliver the War God's robe to Wujing.

00:07:36.339 --> 00:07:38.098
The marriage will be held tomorrow.

00:07:38.099 --> 00:07:39.379
Prince Zhi will

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.178
welcome Princess Liluo to the sanctuary.

00:07:41.179 --> 00:07:43.338
Since you're here safe and sound,

00:07:43.339 --> 00:07:44.139
then the groom

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:45.218
of this marriage...

00:07:45.219 --> 00:07:46.419
White Envoy,

00:07:50.859 --> 00:07:54.059
the one marrying the Wujing Saintess
is now me.

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:55.820
Are you going to decide on your own

00:07:56.219 --> 00:07:57.460
to swap grooms?

00:07:58.419 --> 00:08:00.820
The one marrying the Wujing Saintess

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:02.900
has always been Prince Shang.

00:08:03.339 --> 00:08:04.738
You were swapped in

00:08:04.739 --> 00:08:07.179
only because Prince Shang was dying.

00:08:10.779 --> 00:08:12.020
Fine.

00:08:14.659 --> 00:08:15.858
Fine.

00:08:15.859 --> 00:08:17.419
I believe there's a misunderstanding.

00:08:17.859 --> 00:08:18.900
I've told you.

00:08:19.099 --> 00:08:20.539
I won't marry Liluo,

00:08:20.739 --> 00:08:23.299
and I'll stop anyone of the sanctuary
from marrying her.

00:08:23.539 --> 00:08:24.499
I'm here

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.700
not to fight with Nie Rongzhi
over anything.

00:08:26.739 --> 00:08:29.699
It's because I already know the true meaning
of the Dragon King's Decree.

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:31.499
A Dragon and a Wujing Saintess

00:08:31.939 --> 00:08:33.499
don't need to get married

00:08:33.579 --> 00:08:35.460
to save the sanctuary from destruction.

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:39.458
Young Master, you can tell everything

00:08:39.459 --> 00:08:41.379
to His Majesty back at the sanctuary.

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:43.778
Regarding the marriage
with the Wujing Saintess,

00:08:43.779 --> 00:08:46.499
we need to settle it today.

00:08:46.659 --> 00:08:48.139
This is the one and only battle robe

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:50.259
of the Wujing Saintess.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.859
Please keep it safe.

00:08:56.659 --> 00:08:59.099
The one and only battle robe
of the Wujing Saintess?

00:08:59.419 --> 00:09:01.298
Then what will happen

00:09:01.299 --> 00:09:02.379
if an impostor wears it?

00:09:03.939 --> 00:09:05.660
It's just a battle robe.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.700
It still can't change the fact
that I'm the Wujing Saintess.

00:09:09.179 --> 00:09:10.499
Relay the order.

00:09:10.659 --> 00:09:12.979
Place the battle robe under tight guard.

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:16.499
No outsiders may get near it.

00:09:16.779 --> 00:09:18.739
No mistakes are allowed.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:20.700
Yes, my lady.

00:09:20.779 --> 00:09:23.339
The handover ceremony
of the Wujing Saintess' robe is done.

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.418
The ceremony proceeds tomorrow.

00:09:25.419 --> 00:09:28.180
We'll be waiting
for your return in the sanctuary.

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:44.019
Zhilou!

00:09:45.539 --> 00:09:46.619
Young Master, how are you?

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:47.019
Zhilou,

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.538
I thought I'd never see you again.

00:09:48.539 --> 00:09:49.420
Zhilou.

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:57.300
We're both fine.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:58.339
Alright.

00:09:58.340 --> 00:09:59.139
Zhilou,

00:09:59.419 --> 00:10:00.820
I'm glad that you're fine.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:01.979
It won't be long

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.859
the truth will come to light.

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:10.820
Thank you for the concern, Young Lord.
I'll take care of my own wife.

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:17.580
Your Highness,

00:10:17.699 --> 00:10:18.859
you're mistaken.

00:10:19.059 --> 00:10:21.420
I only have respect for Zhilou.

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:25.139
Yes, Young Master.

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.619
It seems your brother isn't in favor
of you marrying into the sanctuary.

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:47.060
Tomorrow, he might plot with Feng Zhilou
and betray you,

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.060
ruining your marriage.

00:10:49.939 --> 00:10:51.859
You've no right to criticize me.

00:10:52.179 --> 00:10:54.420
Didn't you say
you've killed Chu Moshang?

00:10:54.579 --> 00:10:56.700
Why is he here safe and sound?

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:58.060
Are you toying with me?

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:02.540
So what if he's back?

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:06.220
Could he break our engagement?

00:11:06.459 --> 00:11:09.060
No one in the sanctuary
can control me now.

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:10.820
But you...

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:14.099
If you dare make a mistake tomorrow,

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.420
I won't be merciful.

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:29.340
Your Highness,

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:31.619
since you've chosen Prince Zhi,

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:33.298
you must stand united with him.

00:11:33.299 --> 00:11:34.379
We must now

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:36.058
stop Feng Zhilou and the Young Lord

00:11:36.059 --> 00:11:37.379
from ruining the ceremony.

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:39.499
As for Prince Shang,

00:11:39.779 --> 00:11:41.259
Prince Zhi will take care of him.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:42.818
We don't need to interfere,

00:11:42.819 --> 00:11:44.259
nor are we capable of it.

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:46.619
Kill them.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:47.418
Kill them.

00:11:47.419 --> 00:11:49.019
Kill them all!

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:49.979
Your Highness,

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.499
please calm down.

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:52.979
Don't lose your composure.

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:54.580
Shut your mouth!

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:28.100
♪The rust-stained sword
pierces the evening glow♪

00:12:29.579 --> 00:12:30.760
This is where I leave you.

00:12:31.459 --> 00:12:33.220
I'll soon return from the sanctuary.

00:12:33.939 --> 00:12:34.779
Don't worry.

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:36.599
No one can hurt me again.

Be careful.

I'll await your return.

00:13:31.059 --> 00:13:32.019
Shang,

00:13:32.419 --> 00:13:34.739
you came back just to tell me

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:36.259
that you've witnessed the truth

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:37.899
of the Dragon King's Decree?

00:13:37.939 --> 00:13:38.938
Feng Zhilou is

00:13:38.939 --> 00:13:41.940
the true Wujing Saintess?

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:43.899
Is that not enough?

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.420
Just what spell has Feng Zhilou
cast over you?

00:13:46.579 --> 00:13:48.739
You actually play along with her act,

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:49.899
faking your death

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:51.778
to gain Father's forgiveness.

00:13:51.779 --> 00:13:53.779
That way, Father will agree
to let you marry her.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.499
I've always acted with integrity.

00:13:56.579 --> 00:13:58.779
I wouldn't bother with a scheme.

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:00.899
If you won't believe me,

00:14:00.939 --> 00:14:02.940
then we'll have to witness the truth.

00:14:03.059 --> 00:14:03.940
Alright.

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:06.578
Since you say Feng Zhilou
is the Wujing Saintess,

00:14:06.579 --> 00:14:09.060
then why is the sanctuary's barrier
still weakening?

00:14:10.059 --> 00:14:11.538
Don't twist the facts.

00:14:11.539 --> 00:14:13.698
The Dragon King's Decree
is never about saving the barrier

00:14:13.699 --> 00:14:15.280
with just a marriage.

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.080
You object so much to my relationship
with Feng Zhilou.

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.619
Are you afraid the Dragon God

00:14:18.699 --> 00:14:20.739
won't approve of you at the ceremony?

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:24.220
Would that be the Dragon God

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:26.220
or you guys?

00:14:26.419 --> 00:14:29.099
Princess Liluo is already proven
to be the Wujing Saintess.

00:14:29.459 --> 00:14:30.979
She chose me.

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:33.180
I'll save the sanctuary too,

00:14:33.299 --> 00:14:35.420
so why can't I do it?

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:39.340
You've chosen Feng Zhilou and abandoned
the throne of the Dragon King.

00:14:39.699 --> 00:14:41.580
Just who is twisting the facts now?

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:43.019
In that case,

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:45.019
tomorrow at Wujing's War God's Hall,

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:46.700
the marriage

00:14:46.779 --> 00:14:50.619
of Liluo and Zhi will go on as usual.

00:14:50.659 --> 00:14:53.139
I'll allow you to marry Feng Zhilou,

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:56.778
but you can't disrupt the completion
of the Dragon King's Decree.

00:14:56.779 --> 00:14:57.499
Alright,

00:14:58.459 --> 00:14:59.859
but I request that Zhilou and I

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:01.940
be there at the ceremony tomorrow.

00:15:04.179 --> 00:15:05.460
You're always welcome.

00:15:05.699 --> 00:15:06.420
Father,

00:15:06.579 --> 00:15:08.139
I only wish for you to know

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:09.499
that I'm compromising

00:15:09.539 --> 00:15:11.220
not just to be with Zhilou.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:12.660
Our relationship has

00:15:12.779 --> 00:15:14.499
always been our choice.

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:16.340
You'll understand one day.

00:15:16.459 --> 00:15:17.499
The sanctuary

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.298
will pay the price for its idiocy

00:15:19.299 --> 00:15:20.619
and arrogance.

00:15:32.779 --> 00:15:34.060
Young Lord,

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:34.859
are you really sure

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:36.660
that you'll expose Liluo
and Li Yue's scheme

00:15:36.699 --> 00:15:39.058
at the ceremony tomorrow?

00:15:39.059 --> 00:15:40.698
Tomorrow, I'll be attending the ceremony

00:15:40.699 --> 00:15:42.099
as the Wujing City Lord.

00:15:42.299 --> 00:15:45.099
I'll announce to my mother,
the sanctuary and the whole world

00:15:45.419 --> 00:15:47.540
the self-accusation decree of my mother,

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:49.178
Liluo and myself.

00:15:49.179 --> 00:15:50.379
But a self-accusation decree

00:15:50.539 --> 00:15:52.139
means you'll lose everything.

00:15:53.779 --> 00:15:55.820
I already have what's most precious.

00:15:56.299 --> 00:15:57.619
Once everything is over,

00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:59.379
you'll return to being the City Lord.

00:15:59.380 --> 00:15:59.979
Zhilou,

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:01.700
with a Saintess like you,

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.340
even if the Demons invade,

00:16:03.419 --> 00:16:04.979
all races will be truly united

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:06.739
under your leadership.

00:16:09.659 --> 00:16:11.420
While growing up in Feng Manor,

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:14.019
I've just been a loser
everyone attacked.

00:16:14.699 --> 00:16:16.259
I never once thought

00:16:16.699 --> 00:16:18.460
I could be the Wujing Saintess.

00:16:18.779 --> 00:16:19.779
Being the City Lord....

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:21.899
My dream as a child was

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:23.859
to move to Wujing

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:25.700
and make a name for myself.

00:16:25.819 --> 00:16:27.859
But when I'm actually here,

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:29.379
I realize

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:32.019
that nothing matters to me anymore.

00:16:32.659 --> 00:16:34.779
I've already
found the true meaning of my life.

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:36.499
Fighting as one with my lover

00:16:37.059 --> 00:16:38.540
and protecting all life in the world

00:16:39.059 --> 00:16:40.619
is now my only desire.

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:42.420
It has nothing to do with status.

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:45.019
It's actually the best

00:16:45.299 --> 00:16:47.019
for Wujing to have a City Lord

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:48.580
who's dutiful and loves its people

00:16:49.299 --> 00:16:50.778
like you.

00:16:50.779 --> 00:16:51.979
Zhilou!

00:16:52.059 --> 00:16:52.658
Bad news!

00:16:52.659 --> 00:16:54.619
We can't find Yue in the apothecary!
