00:00:50.864 --> 00:00:52.740
We're getting married today.

00:00:52.824 --> 00:00:54.284
Hello.

00:00:55.451 --> 00:00:56.661
Hello!

00:00:56.744 --> 00:00:57.954
-Hey, congrats!
-Hey, man.

00:00:58.037 --> 00:00:59.581
-Congratulations!
-Hello.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.585
-Hello.
-Congrats! You look great!

00:01:03.668 --> 00:01:06.004
HAPPY YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED?
HAPPY YOU'RE A FAMILY OF THREE?

00:01:06.087 --> 00:01:08.131
WELCOME TO THE WEDDING
OF KI-DAE AND YUN-SU

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:10.758
Get in here.

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:12.927
Thank you.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.014
-Hello!
-Congratulations!

00:01:16.097 --> 00:01:17.974
Thank you.

00:01:18.641 --> 00:01:22.103
Now, shall we go and meet the bride?

00:01:22.187 --> 00:01:24.397
-Hello, Ki-dae.
-Hey, you came.

00:01:24.981 --> 00:01:26.357
Thanks.

00:01:26.441 --> 00:01:27.275
Thank you.

00:01:27.358 --> 00:01:29.277
-Hello!
-Hi.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.029
-The bride is so beautiful!
-Thanks.

00:01:32.614 --> 00:01:34.616
Here's the star of the day!

00:01:35.116 --> 00:01:37.702
-What's this? What are you doing?
-Hang on!

00:01:37.785 --> 00:01:40.914
-She's not quite ready.
-But I have to film this.

00:01:40.997 --> 00:01:41.831
Hang on!

00:01:41.915 --> 00:01:45.043
-Seriously!
-No, don't. Please. Wait, where's Sop?

00:01:45.126 --> 00:01:46.544
Mun-jun, take the camera.

00:01:50.256 --> 00:01:51.883
Where did Sop go?

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:54.969
All right, then!

00:01:55.053 --> 00:01:58.640
Bride and groom, please exchange rings!

00:01:58.723 --> 00:01:59.724
Congratulations!

00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:01.476
Wishing you a happy life!

00:02:03.895 --> 00:02:04.938
-Huh?
-It's missing.

00:02:05.021 --> 00:02:06.272
What's going on?

00:02:06.356 --> 00:02:07.941
-The ring's missing.
-What?

00:02:08.816 --> 00:02:09.984
Ta-da!

00:02:14.322 --> 00:02:19.911
"Do you, Lee Ki-dae and An Yun-su, promise
to always bicker over trivial things,

00:02:19.994 --> 00:02:24.165
yet stand united when it matters most?"

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:25.124
-I do!
-I do!

00:02:25.208 --> 00:02:27.252
"Do you have what it takes

00:02:27.335 --> 00:02:31.881
to take good care of sweet Sop
and keep her from feeling lonely?"

00:02:31.965 --> 00:02:33.007
-I do!
-I do!

00:02:33.091 --> 00:02:38.012
"We now pronounce
the three of you a family,

00:02:38.096 --> 00:02:41.099
inseparable even in death."

00:02:45.645 --> 00:02:47.146
It's time for the bouquet toss.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.731
Me! Here! Over here!

00:02:52.777 --> 00:02:56.322
Kiss!

00:03:04.706 --> 00:03:06.416
Thank you!

00:03:07.625 --> 00:03:08.751
Wishing you a happy life!

00:03:10.336 --> 00:03:11.713
You're so lucky!

00:03:28.688 --> 00:03:30.356
911, what's your emergency?

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.608
It's my husband.

00:03:33.651 --> 00:03:35.820
He's bleeding so much.

00:03:35.903 --> 00:03:37.196
What happened, ma'am?

00:03:38.114 --> 00:03:40.658
He was stabbed in the neck. Please help.

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:42.535
What's the address?

00:03:43.036 --> 00:03:46.372
32 Jungri-eup, Paju.

00:03:46.456 --> 00:03:47.957
It used to be a paint shop.

00:03:48.041 --> 00:03:49.709
Is your husband conscious?

00:03:49.792 --> 00:03:51.210
He's breathing.

00:03:52.378 --> 00:03:53.755
But he's not opening his eyes.

00:03:53.838 --> 00:03:55.381
So he's breathing.

00:03:55.465 --> 00:03:57.425
-But he's unresponsive?
-Please hurry!

00:03:57.508 --> 00:04:01.012
Yes, ma'am. Another operator
is dispatching an ambulance as we speak.

00:04:01.095 --> 00:04:03.806
I'm here, Ki-dae.

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:04.724
Open your eyes.

00:04:06.726 --> 00:04:07.852
Don't close your eyes.

00:04:07.935 --> 00:04:10.396
Don't close them, Ki-dae. Open them.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.939
Open your eyes, Ki-dae.

00:04:12.815 --> 00:04:15.151
Please hurry!

00:04:26.829 --> 00:04:30.124
We will now say our final goodbyes.

00:04:30.625 --> 00:04:33.836
THE LATE LEE KI-DAE

00:05:04.951 --> 00:05:06.744
-Take care.
-I will. Thanks.

00:05:07.328 --> 00:05:08.538
Ms. An!

00:05:08.621 --> 00:05:10.289
No way.

00:05:12.458 --> 00:05:13.751
-Ms. An!
-Hey.

00:05:13.835 --> 00:05:16.712
You really didn't have to come.

00:05:16.796 --> 00:05:17.797
Of course we did.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.508
Thanks so much, guys.

00:05:21.592 --> 00:05:22.635
A FEW DAYS LATER

00:05:22.718 --> 00:05:25.388
I know this is a difficult time.
Sorry for asking you to be here.

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.391
No, of course I should come.

00:05:35.064 --> 00:05:36.607
Regarding your husband's phone,

00:05:36.691 --> 00:05:39.902
none of the passcodes
you've given us work.

00:05:40.903 --> 00:05:43.114
I've told you all the ones I know.

00:05:43.197 --> 00:05:45.575
That's unfortunate.
iPhones aren't easy to unlock.

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:47.160
I see.

00:05:48.202 --> 00:05:50.997
Would you like a drink? Coffee? Green tea?

00:05:51.581 --> 00:05:53.708
Coffee, please. A mild one.

00:05:53.791 --> 00:05:54.750
Sure.

00:05:56.335 --> 00:05:58.129
It's instant coffee. Is that okay?

00:05:58.212 --> 00:05:59.672
I like instant coffee.

00:05:59.755 --> 00:06:01.007
One moment, please.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.805
We usually question family members first
in a case like this.

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:11.142
It's also part of the process
to rule them out as suspects first.

00:06:12.143 --> 00:06:14.145
-Can I talk--
-I'm done.

00:06:14.228 --> 00:06:16.230
-You may speak now.
-It's nothing, really.

00:06:16.814 --> 00:06:18.774
I've watched all the episodes of CSI.

00:06:18.858 --> 00:06:21.444
They always start with family members too.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.239
Haven't you seen it?

00:06:29.368 --> 00:06:30.578
She's smiling again.

00:06:31.621 --> 00:06:32.914
She smiled again, right?

00:06:34.332 --> 00:06:36.000
Maybe she just smiles a lot.

00:06:36.542 --> 00:06:37.793
In a situation like this?

00:06:38.544 --> 00:06:39.879
You think that's normal?

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:41.756
Look at what she's wearing.

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:44.133
-Are you ready to continue, ma'am?
-Yes.

00:06:45.134 --> 00:06:47.220
Do you have any other family?

00:06:48.054 --> 00:06:48.888
No.

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:53.226
Ki-dae's an only child
and lost his parents in high school.

00:06:53.726 --> 00:06:55.728
I was orphaned at a young age.

00:06:56.479 --> 00:06:57.730
Oh, I see.

00:06:58.231 --> 00:07:00.274
Are you in touch with any relatives?

00:07:01.234 --> 00:07:04.904
Sop, Ki-dae, and me,
the three of us are the only family…

00:07:08.533 --> 00:07:09.492
we had.

00:07:09.992 --> 00:07:14.330
You seem to always call
your husband by his name.

00:07:14.914 --> 00:07:17.083
Yes, it's out of habit.

00:07:17.583 --> 00:07:20.127
We spent years in college together
before marrying.

00:07:20.211 --> 00:07:22.838
Oh, I see.

00:07:24.632 --> 00:07:27.134
There was an issue
with your dashcam's memory card,

00:07:27.218 --> 00:07:29.428
so nothing was recorded.

00:07:29.512 --> 00:07:32.515
So you're saying
you saw someone coming out

00:07:32.598 --> 00:07:34.934
as you arrived
and were parking at the studio?

00:07:35.017 --> 00:07:35.851
Yes.

00:07:39.438 --> 00:07:43.442
If they were dressed like that,
didn't you find it suspicious at the time?

00:07:43.526 --> 00:07:46.362
Most visitors to the studio
are friends from printmaking.

00:07:46.445 --> 00:07:47.905
They usually dress like this.

00:07:47.989 --> 00:07:51.033
I guess not all artists are the same.

00:07:51.117 --> 00:07:56.539
Well, it depends on their major
and personal taste.

00:08:02.962 --> 00:08:05.464
As for me, I'm into bold clothes.

00:08:06.465 --> 00:08:08.968
Right, I can see that.

00:08:09.635 --> 00:08:12.722
We've spoken to all your friends
who frequent the studio.

00:08:12.805 --> 00:08:15.349
It seems your husband
had been saying for days

00:08:15.433 --> 00:08:17.393
that he had a date with you that day.

00:08:17.893 --> 00:08:20.271
He told them
not to even think about coming.

00:08:20.354 --> 00:08:21.772
Were you aware of this?

00:08:25.651 --> 00:08:28.613
That was the day
we'd planned to try for our second child.

00:08:29.739 --> 00:08:32.033
Sop was conceived in that studio.

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:36.621
We'd planned to drink the same wine
on the same couch in the same studio…

00:08:38.706 --> 00:08:40.124
to try for our second child.

00:08:48.674 --> 00:08:50.968
We found this under the couch
in the studio.

00:08:53.638 --> 00:08:55.014
Are they yours, Ms. An?

00:08:56.515 --> 00:08:57.558
No.

00:08:58.309 --> 00:08:59.143
Actually,

00:09:00.645 --> 00:09:03.648
a friend named Oh Seo-won
came by that day.

00:09:06.192 --> 00:09:08.027
She looked up to Ki-dae.

00:09:12.865 --> 00:09:15.493
Is this your drawing of her?

00:09:16.869 --> 00:09:17.703
No.

00:09:18.621 --> 00:09:20.539
It was raining and very dark.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:24.502
It's not what you think.

00:09:36.639 --> 00:09:37.723
Let go of me.

00:09:38.432 --> 00:09:39.266
Let go!

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:40.601
Is your wrist okay?

00:09:44.855 --> 00:09:46.357
I bruise easily.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.109
And they last a long time.

00:10:01.497 --> 00:10:05.042
We need to review
the questions from earlier.

00:10:06.252 --> 00:10:07.086
Well,

00:10:08.212 --> 00:10:10.047
I've told

00:10:11.549 --> 00:10:14.427
Detective Ryu everything already.

00:10:15.636 --> 00:10:19.223
Since you're a key witness,
we need an accurate statement.

00:10:19.306 --> 00:10:20.808
Please cooperate with us.

00:10:20.891 --> 00:10:24.061
You went to your husband's studio
the evening of April 15th, correct?

00:10:26.021 --> 00:10:26.939
Yes.

00:10:27.022 --> 00:10:29.024
Roughly what time was it?

00:10:29.775 --> 00:10:32.570
I think I said around eight before.

00:10:33.154 --> 00:10:36.532
You said Ms. Oh was at the studio,
didn't you?

00:10:40.661 --> 00:10:42.496
I said I think she was.

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:46.584
How long did you stay in your car
after you arrived at the studio?

00:10:47.168 --> 00:10:48.294
Ten minutes?

00:10:56.886 --> 00:10:59.430
Look, she's a widow
who just lost her husband.

00:10:59.513 --> 00:11:02.141
We can't just keep her here
when we have nothing on her.

00:11:02.641 --> 00:11:04.310
So? Do we just let her go?

00:11:04.393 --> 00:11:07.313
Or do we have a reason
to keep her here any longer?

00:11:08.689 --> 00:11:09.940
Say something!

00:11:10.858 --> 00:11:13.652
I saw Dong-hun visiting Team 3 earlier.

00:11:14.612 --> 00:11:16.781
Baek Dong-hun, that guy…

00:11:17.323 --> 00:11:19.033
He makes me uncomfortable.

00:11:19.116 --> 00:11:21.744
The way he crosses lines
during investigations

00:11:21.827 --> 00:11:24.497
and the fact that
he's an ex-police prosecutor are just…

00:11:25.998 --> 00:11:27.249
He may be unsettling,

00:11:27.833 --> 00:11:28.959
but he gets results.

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:40.805
Yes?

00:11:46.769 --> 00:11:48.604
Interviewing the witness until now?

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.944
What case is it?

00:12:05.955 --> 00:12:08.999
-Hey.
-She just went to the bathroom.

00:12:11.418 --> 00:12:13.254
Okay, let's start with the files.

00:12:14.839 --> 00:12:16.757
It's nothing, really.

00:12:17.424 --> 00:12:19.385
I've watched all the episodes of CSI.

00:12:19.468 --> 00:12:21.887
They always start with family members too.

00:12:22.388 --> 00:12:25.432
A lot of what she said doesn't make sense.

00:12:25.516 --> 00:12:30.104
Her emotional state isn't
what you'd expect from a victim's wife.

00:12:34.984 --> 00:12:38.737
Etchant was used to erase
all possible traces at the scene.

00:12:41.699 --> 00:12:44.493
That wine bottle was the murder weapon.

00:12:44.577 --> 00:12:46.954
We're doing what we can
to find any kind of evidence,

00:12:47.037 --> 00:12:49.832
but it was shattered into pieces,
so it's taking a long time.

00:12:51.709 --> 00:12:54.670
That's the carving knife
with the victim's blood on it.

00:12:54.753 --> 00:12:56.630
There was no trace of etchant on it,

00:12:56.714 --> 00:12:58.716
nor any trace of An Yun-su.

00:12:59.383 --> 00:13:01.051
No trace of etchant?

00:13:01.135 --> 00:13:02.136
That's right.

00:13:22.364 --> 00:13:23.365
Watch your step!

00:13:23.449 --> 00:13:24.450
Be careful.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.869
-Hey, watch the body.
-Yes, sir!

00:13:26.952 --> 00:13:28.579
Move!

00:13:32.666 --> 00:13:33.792
Excuse me!

00:13:55.981 --> 00:13:57.149
What should we do?

00:14:24.218 --> 00:14:25.886
I have to go home.

00:14:31.809 --> 00:14:34.478
I have to go home.
My daughter is waiting for me.

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:36.605
Hello?

00:14:55.124 --> 00:14:56.458
Ms. An?

00:14:57.459 --> 00:14:59.378
We're done here. You may go home now.

00:15:01.213 --> 00:15:02.047
Are we…

00:15:04.383 --> 00:15:05.467
doing the right thing?

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:08.637
If there's no evidence,
we have to let her go.

00:15:09.138 --> 00:15:10.848
Besides, her daughter is waiting.

00:15:20.107 --> 00:15:21.108
By the way,

00:15:22.067 --> 00:15:23.444
thank you for everything.

00:15:23.944 --> 00:15:25.070
Thank you.

00:15:25.696 --> 00:15:26.530
No problem.

00:15:35.372 --> 00:15:37.666
Hand the case over to me.

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:39.501
I'll inform the chief prosecutor.

00:15:45.883 --> 00:15:48.510
Sop, do you want this mixed or as it is?

00:15:48.594 --> 00:15:49.720
Mix it for me.

00:15:50.387 --> 00:15:51.472
Okay.

00:16:02.357 --> 00:16:03.692
Hold the bow for me.

00:16:07.196 --> 00:16:08.906
You can put on your socks, can't you?

00:16:10.074 --> 00:16:12.326
Sop, grape juice or apple juice?

00:16:12.409 --> 00:16:14.495
-Grape juice.
-Okay, got it.

00:16:30.719 --> 00:16:32.513
-Hi. Oh, hello.
-Hello.

00:16:33.806 --> 00:16:35.766
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hi there.

00:16:37.101 --> 00:16:38.560
The vocab test is a bit hard.

00:16:43.857 --> 00:16:44.691
Hey.

00:16:44.775 --> 00:16:46.944
Morning, guys.

00:16:47.027 --> 00:16:48.195
Ms. An.

00:16:50.447 --> 00:16:51.573
-Hi.
-You know…

00:17:08.549 --> 00:17:10.676
-Pour just a little, please.
-Is this okay?

00:17:10.759 --> 00:17:12.427
Yes, I have to drive today.

00:17:12.511 --> 00:17:15.514
-You drove here? That's a shame.
-Yes, sorry.

00:17:16.223 --> 00:17:18.684
-It has such a nice aroma.
-It's a fine wine.

00:17:19.184 --> 00:17:21.645
-Should I take a sip?
-Oh, no. You shouldn't.

00:17:22.146 --> 00:17:24.982
If you visit again when you're free,
I'll have some ready.

00:17:25.065 --> 00:17:27.442
-Try the aroma of…
-It's really similar.

00:17:27.526 --> 00:17:28.402
-It is, right?
-Yes.

00:17:28.485 --> 00:17:30.237
It's similar to your usual wine.

00:18:27.753 --> 00:18:29.671
Bye, Sop. Get home safely..

00:18:31.548 --> 00:18:32.633
Bye!

00:18:33.675 --> 00:18:35.135
Are you going home now?

00:18:36.345 --> 00:18:37.387
Take care.

00:18:50.692 --> 00:18:52.569
They asked for help.

00:18:55.989 --> 00:18:57.866
I walked in and found someone collapsed.

00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:59.868
Can you tell if it's male or female?

00:19:02.955 --> 00:19:04.039
It's the mom. A woman.

00:19:10.379 --> 00:19:12.589
So it's the mom and sister, right?

00:19:15.884 --> 00:19:18.387
-Yes.
-Where have you been all day?

00:19:18.887 --> 00:19:20.806
We have the teacher's file.

00:19:20.889 --> 00:19:22.516
Okay, I'll be right there.

00:20:17.237 --> 00:20:20.449
Wait. Didn't you go
to the chief's housewarming?

00:20:20.532 --> 00:20:21.867
Here, you can take this.

00:20:22.367 --> 00:20:24.202
Oh, you didn't have to.

00:20:25.662 --> 00:20:27.372
Mr. Hwang, do you use Karrot app?

00:20:27.456 --> 00:20:30.042
GIVING AWAY MY HUSBAND'S CLOTHES AND SHOES

00:20:30.125 --> 00:20:31.501
He hasn't been gone that long.

00:20:31.585 --> 00:20:32.544
WELL-MAINTAINED

00:20:32.627 --> 00:20:34.504
What is this? Her way of mourning?

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:38.508
Or she could be erasing him.

00:20:39.801 --> 00:20:40.844
Erasing him?

00:20:44.389 --> 00:20:46.308
Leave this sort of thing to the police.

00:20:47.184 --> 00:20:50.937
You're swamped with paperwork.
Doing the legwork will only wear you out.

00:20:51.021 --> 00:20:54.066
You'll work all night again.
That's why you missed the housewarming.

00:20:54.566 --> 00:20:55.525
You can leave first.

00:20:56.818 --> 00:20:57.819
Okay, then.

00:20:58.737 --> 00:20:59.905
I'll be going, sir.

00:21:09.122 --> 00:21:10.165
What are you doing?

00:21:11.875 --> 00:21:14.044
-Quit it.
-Oh man, you jerk.

00:21:14.127 --> 00:21:15.545
What's your deal? Come here.

00:21:20.217 --> 00:21:22.386
-Is she really asleep?
-No, she's dead.

00:21:22.886 --> 00:21:24.554
She even snored earlier.

00:21:25.055 --> 00:21:27.849
I should've known
when she offered to be the model.

00:21:28.517 --> 00:21:31.770
I told you clearly to raise your hand
if you wanted to be the model.

00:21:31.853 --> 00:21:35.148
You guys are the ones who refused to,
so stop complaining.

00:21:35.232 --> 00:21:36.608
Come on, Ms. An!

00:21:36.691 --> 00:21:39.152
You would've made us do a weird pose
if we volunteered.

00:21:39.236 --> 00:21:44.366
Guys, what the model looks like
isn't important.

00:21:44.866 --> 00:21:47.244
Think about how you feel about the model.

00:21:47.744 --> 00:21:50.789
Use your imagination and just draw it.

00:21:51.415 --> 00:21:52.624
It's not what you see,

00:21:53.542 --> 00:21:54.793
but what you feel.

00:21:57.587 --> 00:22:00.257
-That's even harder.
-Oh, you've been filming.

00:22:01.299 --> 00:22:02.801
DETECTIVE RYU JI-SU

00:22:06.596 --> 00:22:08.140
-Hello?
-Hey, Dong-hun.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.809
Ms. An called this morning.

00:22:10.892 --> 00:22:14.396
She needed to go to her husband's studio
and asked if she could.

00:22:14.479 --> 00:22:18.066
I told her she can't for now,
since it's currently under investigation.

00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:19.401
Okay, understood.

00:22:20.944 --> 00:22:21.778
Sure.

00:22:42.215 --> 00:22:43.175
That's great.

00:22:44.176 --> 00:22:45.760
My hair is a waterfall now.

00:23:02.235 --> 00:23:04.446
I wonder what part of me this is.

00:23:30.847 --> 00:23:32.390
TEACHER'S PLANNER
YEONBIT MIDDLE SCHOOL

00:23:59.668 --> 00:24:01.795
10 ETCHANT FOR PRINTMAKING 5 L

00:24:01.878 --> 00:24:03.088
TOTAL 300,000 WON

00:24:03.171 --> 00:24:07.092
Etchant was used to erase
all possible traces at the scene.

00:24:10.136 --> 00:24:12.430
DETECTIVE RYU JI-SU

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:20.021
You've caught the killer?

00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:23.692
Hold on a moment, please.

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:26.987
Can I help you?

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.409
Are you a parent?

00:24:34.369 --> 00:24:36.037
I've come to the wrong classroom.

00:24:36.121 --> 00:24:37.289
-I see.
-Right.

00:24:38.039 --> 00:24:38.873
Excuse me.

00:24:40.083 --> 00:24:41.459
Are you sure it was her?

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.217
You admit you had an affair
with the victim?

00:24:49.843 --> 00:24:51.720
He was just a friend I liked.

00:24:52.345 --> 00:24:53.972
It wasn't an affair.

00:24:54.764 --> 00:24:58.310
If the friend you like is married,
that's considered an affair.

00:24:58.935 --> 00:25:01.187
-Don't you know what an affair is?
-No, I…

00:25:01.271 --> 00:25:02.564
It wasn't me.

00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:05.859
It really wasn't me.

00:25:06.776 --> 00:25:12.032
Ultimately, blood other than the victim's
was found on the murder weapon.

00:25:12.115 --> 00:25:13.450
It belonged to Oh Seo-won.

00:25:13.533 --> 00:25:15.035
What did the suspect say?

00:25:15.535 --> 00:25:17.954
She claims she cut her hand while working.

00:25:18.455 --> 00:25:19.623
Does she have an alibi?

00:25:19.706 --> 00:25:22.000
She said she left the studio
around 5:00 p.m.

00:25:22.083 --> 00:25:23.460
and took a cab home alone.

00:25:24.753 --> 00:25:26.087
She said she paid in cash.

00:25:26.171 --> 00:25:27.964
-So it can't be proven.
-Who has cash nowadays?

00:25:28.048 --> 00:25:30.133
Do you normally have cash with you? Huh?

00:25:33.178 --> 00:25:34.846
How is Ms. An taking it?

00:25:35.513 --> 00:25:37.432
She's calmer than I'd expected.

00:25:37.932 --> 00:25:41.394
She wanted to talk to Oh Seo-won,
but I said she couldn't yet.

00:25:41.895 --> 00:25:43.188
We should let them.

00:25:43.271 --> 00:25:44.105
Sorry?

00:25:45.774 --> 00:25:48.026
-But it's too soon.
-Let them talk.

00:25:51.655 --> 00:25:53.239
Yun-su, it wasn't me.

00:25:57.327 --> 00:25:58.703
I didn't do it.

00:26:04.084 --> 00:26:06.002
Why didn't you come to the funeral?

00:26:07.879 --> 00:26:09.339
I was scared.

00:26:11.883 --> 00:26:15.845
I was the only one
who went to the studio that day.

00:26:18.348 --> 00:26:19.933
But then I heard he died.

00:26:21.476 --> 00:26:22.477
That's right.

00:26:24.312 --> 00:26:26.231
Only you came to the studio that day.

00:26:27.816 --> 00:26:30.193
Even though he asked you not to
so many times.

00:26:31.444 --> 00:26:33.988
It really wasn't me.

00:26:35.573 --> 00:26:37.617
How could I possibly…

00:26:43.623 --> 00:26:45.125
Did you have feelings for him?

00:26:54.342 --> 00:26:55.844
Were the feelings mutual?

00:28:16.257 --> 00:28:20.136
The killer poured etchant
to destroy all potential evidence.

00:28:21.387 --> 00:28:24.808
But there was no trace of it
on the murder weapon itself.

00:29:15.859 --> 00:29:17.986
You can't just miss the knife.

00:29:19.445 --> 00:29:20.947
Unless it's on purpose.

00:30:08.578 --> 00:30:10.413
ANALYSIS COMPLETE

00:30:11.456 --> 00:30:13.082
-The bus is here.
-Have a good day!

00:30:13.833 --> 00:30:15.668
Sop, don't run. Slow down.

00:30:15.752 --> 00:30:17.420
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

00:30:17.503 --> 00:30:18.963
-Careful.
-Bye.

00:30:23.051 --> 00:30:25.762
See you. Say bye-bye to Mommy.

00:30:28.097 --> 00:30:30.975
-I'll see you later.
-Yes, see you later.

00:30:50.787 --> 00:30:51.788
Hello.

00:30:53.623 --> 00:30:57.669
Ms. An, we've found the taxi driver
who drove Ms. Oh Seo-won home.

00:30:58.878 --> 00:31:00.880
Her alibi has checked out.

00:31:02.423 --> 00:31:06.761
Then who killed Ki-dae?

00:31:07.804 --> 00:31:09.389
How shameless.

00:31:10.682 --> 00:31:12.642
You're under arrest
for killing Lee Ki-dae.

00:31:12.725 --> 00:31:14.519
-What?
-You may ask for a lawyer.

00:31:14.602 --> 00:31:16.562
-But I cooperated!
-You may stay silent.

00:31:16.646 --> 00:31:19.649
-It wasn't me. How could I?
-Your words may be used against you.

00:31:19.732 --> 00:31:21.943
-He's Sop's father.
-You can talk at the station.

00:31:22.026 --> 00:31:23.820
I didn't do it. It wasn't--

00:31:23.903 --> 00:31:26.406
-Yes, I hear you.
-Just get in already.

00:31:28.199 --> 00:31:29.075
Sorry.

00:31:31.244 --> 00:31:32.620
Excuse me, guys. Sorry.

00:31:33.621 --> 00:31:34.914
-Ms. Kim!
-Ms. Kim!

00:31:35.707 --> 00:31:36.958
Hold on a moment, sir.

00:31:37.041 --> 00:31:38.418
Wait a minute, please!

00:31:38.501 --> 00:31:42.046
Isn't this going too far?
Must you do this in front of the students?

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:45.675
Look, if you have a problem,
file an objection with the court. Okay?

00:31:45.758 --> 00:31:48.136
-Otherwise, please leave.
-No, you can't.

00:31:49.053 --> 00:31:50.304
For God's sake!

00:32:05.528 --> 00:32:07.905
Maybe I should've brought Sop with me.

00:32:08.781 --> 00:32:10.283
Not to a place like this.

00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:15.079
The police came to the school
and caused a huge scene.

00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:19.000
They took everything, from your laptop
to the students' drawings.

00:32:20.251 --> 00:32:22.170
At least my desk should be clean now.

00:32:23.087 --> 00:32:24.422
How can you joke now?

00:32:25.298 --> 00:32:28.634
My husband won't stop insisting
you get a lawyer immediately.

00:32:28.718 --> 00:32:30.636
I don't need a lawyer.

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:32.513
Besides, it's expensive.

00:32:32.597 --> 00:32:36.225
Money isn't important right now.
You can't stay here forever.

00:32:37.185 --> 00:32:40.438
They can't hold me for more than ten days
if there's no evidence.

00:32:41.022 --> 00:32:41.856
Who said that?

00:32:43.191 --> 00:32:44.609
Gil Grissom.

00:32:46.569 --> 00:32:47.653
From CSI.

00:32:52.784 --> 00:32:54.202
Those damn cops.

00:32:54.994 --> 00:32:57.288
How can they arrest someone like you?

00:32:57.371 --> 00:32:59.165
You know they're listening.

00:32:59.707 --> 00:33:01.459
I meant for them to hear.

00:33:01.959 --> 00:33:03.795
Those bastards.

00:33:07.215 --> 00:33:08.049
Thanks.

00:33:09.675 --> 00:33:11.636
Please take good care of Sop for me.

00:33:16.724 --> 00:33:20.186
You have a witness interview
for the JK fraud case tomorrow.

00:33:20.269 --> 00:33:23.231
They're the chief's friend,
and he wants them treated well.

00:33:23.731 --> 00:33:24.857
Yes, I heard.

00:33:24.941 --> 00:33:28.069
Also, we received the belongings
seized from the female teacher.

00:33:28.152 --> 00:33:30.029
There are tons of videos on her USB.

00:33:30.113 --> 00:33:32.031
Apparently, the couple filmed them.

00:33:32.782 --> 00:33:35.827
The police said
there was no need to examine them.

00:33:36.869 --> 00:33:37.703
Okay.

00:33:38.496 --> 00:33:40.081
Babe, look this way.

00:33:40.581 --> 00:33:43.626
Stop filming.
I told you I'm not in the mood.

00:33:44.418 --> 00:33:46.379
It's not that I don't want to.

00:33:46.462 --> 00:33:49.507
I don't have a stable income right now.
Just a few more years.

00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:52.135
If we keep putting it off,
Sop will grow up alone.

00:33:52.218 --> 00:33:54.971
If something were to happen to us,
she will be all alone.

00:33:55.471 --> 00:33:58.599
Why would you say that? That won't happen.

00:33:58.683 --> 00:33:59.934
How would you know?

00:34:00.518 --> 00:34:03.104
What about you? What about me?

00:34:03.187 --> 00:34:05.398
Did we want to grow up by ourselves?

00:34:06.357 --> 00:34:07.608
Get off me.

00:34:09.152 --> 00:34:10.862
Come on. Don't be like this, babe.

00:34:10.945 --> 00:34:13.156
Just go away, will you? Please.

00:34:16.284 --> 00:34:17.326
Let go of me.

00:34:47.273 --> 00:34:50.693
Have you advised her of her rights?

00:34:50.776 --> 00:34:54.739
Yes, sir.
But she doesn't want an attorney.

00:34:57.909 --> 00:34:59.327
The other day at school…

00:35:00.578 --> 00:35:01.412
Right?

00:35:04.207 --> 00:35:05.249
I'm Prosecutor Baek.

00:35:07.043 --> 00:35:10.379
Would you like to give your statement
when you've hired an attorney?

00:35:11.464 --> 00:35:13.216
No, I'll do it now.

00:35:13.299 --> 00:35:15.051
I have nothing to hide.

00:35:18.971 --> 00:35:20.264
On April 15th,

00:35:21.641 --> 00:35:25.436
in the evening,
you went to your husband's studio.

00:35:25.519 --> 00:35:29.523
Shall we go step by step
through what happened that day?

00:35:33.069 --> 00:35:34.153
God, it's cold.

00:36:03.641 --> 00:36:07.103
No, I didn't know Seo-won had feelings
for Ki-dae back then.

00:36:07.186 --> 00:36:09.730
I simply thought she looked up to him.

00:36:43.139 --> 00:36:45.308
I bought the same wine too.

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:48.436
I dropped it in shock
when I saw him on the floor.

00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:53.149
So, naturally, my fingerprints are on it.

00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:04.744
Let go. Let go of me!

00:37:04.827 --> 00:37:06.287
I said let go!

00:37:26.974 --> 00:37:29.685
No way. You can't be serious.

00:37:30.936 --> 00:37:33.064
How could you even think…

00:37:41.781 --> 00:37:43.115
I told you already.

00:37:44.325 --> 00:37:47.370
I bought the etchant for my classes.

00:37:47.453 --> 00:37:50.164
There's no etching room at school,
so I used his studio.

00:38:21.404 --> 00:38:22.488
Wait.

00:38:23.656 --> 00:38:26.409
Why aren't you listening
to what I'm saying?

00:38:33.749 --> 00:38:37.336
We found a carving knife
damaged by etchant in the toolbox.

00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:41.966
It's an exact match to the stab wound
on your husband's neck.

00:38:43.259 --> 00:38:45.553
Didn't you call Detective Ryu
a few days ago?

00:38:46.053 --> 00:38:47.388
Asking to access the studio?

00:38:47.888 --> 00:38:49.932
-Because I need my students' drawings.
-No.

00:38:50.641 --> 00:38:52.518
To get rid of this carving knife.

00:38:53.269 --> 00:38:57.064
Only then would Oh Seo-won
be the perfect killer.

00:38:57.148 --> 00:38:59.275
I never wanted her to be the killer.

00:39:00.901 --> 00:39:03.571
Then how would you explain this sketch?

00:39:06.323 --> 00:39:08.367
I just drew what I saw.

00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:10.411
Ms. An.

00:39:11.579 --> 00:39:14.623
There aren't any cameras or witnesses
around the studio.

00:39:15.291 --> 00:39:17.084
You made it up.

00:39:17.835 --> 00:39:20.754
You made it all up.
There was no hooded jacket.

00:39:25.551 --> 00:39:30.097
Your students' petition was delivered
to the prosecutor's office this morning.

00:39:31.557 --> 00:39:33.809
It says, "My teacher wouldn't hurt a fly."

00:39:33.893 --> 00:39:36.645
You're not the type to hurt anyone,
apparently.

00:39:38.022 --> 00:39:41.358
You're a teacher who has never once
physically punished a student.

00:39:41.442 --> 00:39:42.318
PETITION

00:39:42.401 --> 00:39:44.028
A kind teacher.

00:39:47.781 --> 00:39:51.327
Now, this is the file from your orphanage.

00:39:53.704 --> 00:39:56.457
It says you pushed a friend
down the stairs when you were 12,

00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:57.541
breaking her leg.

00:39:58.709 --> 00:39:59.960
But the reason was

00:40:00.503 --> 00:40:04.673
that you saw her photo
on the school lunch milk carton.

00:40:05.799 --> 00:40:09.887
"I hated how happily she smiled,
so I pushed her down the stairs."

00:40:10.721 --> 00:40:11.972
That's what you said.

00:40:15.559 --> 00:40:16.727
Ms. An.

00:40:18.896 --> 00:40:20.356
Which is the real you?

00:40:28.239 --> 00:40:31.242
You never had any intention
of listening to me in the first place.

00:40:31.742 --> 00:40:33.160
You decided I was the killer--

00:40:35.412 --> 00:40:36.956
You'll be seeing me again.

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:22.167
GYEONGGI BUKBU DETENTION CENTER

00:41:40.603 --> 00:41:42.688
Hold this and stand in the yellow square.

00:41:47.151 --> 00:41:48.319
Look straight ahead.

00:41:48.402 --> 00:41:51.155
INMATE NUMBER 2784
NAME AN YUN-SU

00:41:51.238 --> 00:41:52.406
Turn to your left.

00:41:53.866 --> 00:41:55.117
Turn the sign this way.

00:42:07.254 --> 00:42:09.006
Strip to your underwear.

00:42:09.506 --> 00:42:11.133
Hurry up.

00:42:19.933 --> 00:42:21.060
Raise both hands.

00:42:22.645 --> 00:42:24.146
Turn around.

00:42:34.448 --> 00:42:37.201
You have a lot of tattoos for a teacher.

00:42:38.118 --> 00:42:39.244
Anywhere else?

00:42:39.745 --> 00:42:40.871
No, that's it.

00:42:40.954 --> 00:42:42.748
Step onto the body scanner.

00:42:44.333 --> 00:42:45.584
Lower your underwear.

00:42:50.381 --> 00:42:52.257
Squat like you're sitting on a toilet.

00:43:13.821 --> 00:43:14.738
Stop.

00:43:14.822 --> 00:43:17.032
Inmates 1381 and 2791, step forward.

00:43:18.033 --> 00:43:20.452
Hey! Look up.

00:43:20.994 --> 00:43:24.498
Let me get a good look at the newbies
with screwed-up lives.

00:43:25.624 --> 00:43:27.167
-Inmate 8692, be quiet!
-Let's go.

00:43:27.251 --> 00:43:28.752
Put the box down.

00:43:33.841 --> 00:43:34.842
2784, step forward.

00:43:36.927 --> 00:43:38.429
Inmate 2784.

00:43:52.109 --> 00:43:54.319
Spousal murder gets a long sentence,
doesn't it?

00:43:54.403 --> 00:43:56.155
Isn't the minimum 20 years?

00:43:58.323 --> 00:44:00.325
What if you adamantly deny the charges?

00:44:00.409 --> 00:44:03.829
In that case, it'd be a life sentence
for showing no remorse.

00:44:03.912 --> 00:44:07.791
If the husband was a fucking bastard,
it would be a mitigating factor.

00:44:08.292 --> 00:44:09.918
Like your goddamn husbands.

00:44:10.461 --> 00:44:14.298
Whether a bastard or a son of a bitch,
how can you kill your husband?

00:44:14.381 --> 00:44:15.424
He's your child's dad.

00:44:15.507 --> 00:44:17.092
Then you're a fucking bitch.

00:44:18.135 --> 00:44:19.928
Hey, you goddamn bitch.

00:44:20.012 --> 00:44:23.140
If I hear you crying,
I swear I'll rip you to pieces.

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:26.018
How dare that bitch. That fucking bitch.

00:44:26.101 --> 00:44:28.437
-Listen and see if that bitch cries.
-Got it.

00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:31.607
The second you whimper,
you're dead meat, you bitch.

00:44:31.690 --> 00:44:34.234
-As soon as I hear…
-Be quiet. See if she's crying.

00:44:34.318 --> 00:44:36.403
I said be quiet.
Can you hear… She's crying.

00:44:38.238 --> 00:44:39.823
Legwork caught you another one.

00:44:41.408 --> 00:44:46.371
You're doing the whole "I'm not like those
who just do paperwork" act,

00:44:47.498 --> 00:44:48.415
aren't you?

00:44:51.418 --> 00:44:52.419
But in reality,

00:44:53.337 --> 00:44:56.340
the others just find it pathetic.

00:44:57.674 --> 00:45:00.803
You're just making it obvious
that you're an ex-cop.

00:45:00.886 --> 00:45:01.720
Don't you think?

00:45:02.262 --> 00:45:04.681
I don't mind it though.

00:45:06.934 --> 00:45:08.685
Look, about that female teacher case.

00:45:09.269 --> 00:45:10.687
Why not work the media?

00:45:11.563 --> 00:45:13.398
Maybe do a little crime reenactment?

00:45:15.567 --> 00:45:17.236
Because of the JK case, sir?

00:45:19.488 --> 00:45:21.323
Among the fraud victims,

00:45:21.824 --> 00:45:23.909
quite a few are higher-ups.

00:45:24.535 --> 00:45:28.497
They don't want the media
catching wind of their screw-up.

00:45:28.997 --> 00:45:30.874
It's not like we're framing anyone.

00:45:32.125 --> 00:45:33.168
Just some distractions.

00:45:47.224 --> 00:45:48.517
Are you pretending to sleep?

00:45:49.184 --> 00:45:50.686
THIS IS THE ORIGINAL UNALTERED VIDEO

00:45:50.769 --> 00:45:51.645
Hey.

00:45:53.063 --> 00:45:55.566
Did you know
we haven't done it at all this month?

00:45:57.234 --> 00:45:59.570
Sorry. I've just been so tired.

00:46:01.697 --> 00:46:03.740
But you've been keeping count?

00:46:04.241 --> 00:46:06.869
I just want to give Sop a sibling.
What's with you?

00:46:10.372 --> 00:46:11.456
Let's go to sleep.

00:46:19.590 --> 00:46:20.924
Listen carefully here.

00:46:22.342 --> 00:46:24.094
Should I actually just kill him?

00:46:24.887 --> 00:46:26.179
Guys, did you just hear that?

00:46:26.263 --> 00:46:27.639
DIGGING DEEPER WITH JOURNALIST HONG

00:46:27.723 --> 00:46:28.974
What you just saw is

00:46:29.474 --> 00:46:32.477
real footage of the husband,
the Ilsan spousal murder victim,

00:46:32.561 --> 00:46:35.939
and his wife,
who was arrested for killing him.

00:46:36.523 --> 00:46:39.776
The female teacher's hidden intent to kill

00:46:40.277 --> 00:46:43.697
was captured on a camera
she believed was turned off.

00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:46.783
Here, she clearly reveals
her true intentions

00:46:46.867 --> 00:46:49.661
and the daily rage
she felt towards her husband.

00:46:50.162 --> 00:46:51.204
For fuck's sake.

00:46:51.788 --> 00:46:53.874
She said she'd kill him
after he refused sex.

00:46:54.374 --> 00:46:57.377
The prosecution investigating
the Ilsan spousal murder case

00:46:57.461 --> 00:47:01.632
determined they secured strong evidence
from a wine bottle shard used as a weapon

00:47:01.715 --> 00:47:04.635
and indicted the female teacher, "A,"
for killing her husband.

00:47:04.718 --> 00:47:06.762
She said something similar at school too.

00:47:07.262 --> 00:47:08.722
She said, "Should I kill them?"

00:47:08.805 --> 00:47:13.101
I didn't think much of it then,
but now it gives me the creeps.

00:47:13.894 --> 00:47:18.398
During art class, she showed us
really graphic and obscene pictures.

00:47:18.482 --> 00:47:20.359
On the day of the incident,

00:47:20.442 --> 00:47:23.236
"A" made a desperate 911 call,
seeking help for her husband.

00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:27.407
Now, a month later, "A" has been sent
to the Gyeonggi Bukbu Detention Center.

00:47:27.491 --> 00:47:32.454
She continues to flatly deny the charges,
protesting her innocence.

00:47:32.537 --> 00:47:36.124
Meanwhile, it has been revealed
that during an earlier witness interview,

00:47:36.208 --> 00:47:39.252
"A" shamelessly identified
a college friend

00:47:39.336 --> 00:47:42.089
whom she suspected
was her husband's lover,

00:47:42.172 --> 00:47:45.300
as the murder suspect
to avoid police suspicion.

00:47:45.384 --> 00:47:48.512
In response, the public has been
strongly criticizing her actions…

00:47:48.595 --> 00:47:49.429
HUSBAND KILLER

00:47:49.513 --> 00:47:52.683
…and is demanding
a rigorous and thorough investigation.

00:47:53.850 --> 00:47:57.020
Why are you doing this to me?
Why go this far…

00:47:57.604 --> 00:47:59.022
There's no way that's true.

00:47:59.106 --> 00:48:01.066
Calm down. Why don't we--

00:48:01.149 --> 00:48:03.568
"Calm down. Keep quiet.
Don't do anything."

00:48:04.069 --> 00:48:06.113
You're supposed to be on my side.

00:48:07.364 --> 00:48:10.158
But why won't you believe what I say?

00:48:11.118 --> 00:48:12.327
By the way,

00:48:12.411 --> 00:48:14.871
who do you think leaked that video?

00:48:15.998 --> 00:48:17.958
-It was me.
-Sorry?

00:48:19.793 --> 00:48:23.088
But why? We had solid evidence.

00:48:23.171 --> 00:48:26.550
We should give that woman a chance
to reflect on her actions.

00:48:29.386 --> 00:48:30.387
Ms. An.

00:48:30.971 --> 00:48:33.598
You should put that down and talk.
Let's take it easy.

00:48:34.433 --> 00:48:35.976
What should I do now?

00:48:38.937 --> 00:48:40.689
Think about your little girl.

00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:43.817
You should think about your little girl.

00:48:54.286 --> 00:48:55.912
-See you tomorrow, Ms. An.
-See you.

00:48:55.996 --> 00:48:57.414
-Hello, Ms. An.
-Hey.

00:48:58.623 --> 00:49:00.459
She ran out this morning, eager to go.

00:49:00.542 --> 00:49:02.919
She's so excited
to stay over at her friend's.

00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:07.340
But she's never slept away from home.
Do you think she'll be okay?

00:49:07.424 --> 00:49:09.217
What if she starts crying in the night?

00:49:09.301 --> 00:49:13.346
Don't worry about Sop.
Let's just focus on getting ready tonight.

00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:15.766
Hey, what should I do with this?

00:49:15.849 --> 00:49:17.350
Is someone there with you?

00:49:17.851 --> 00:49:19.144
I think I heard a woman.

00:49:19.227 --> 00:49:22.189
Yeah, a piece needs finishing.
She won't be long.

00:49:22.272 --> 00:49:23.482
Is it Seo-won again?

00:49:24.024 --> 00:49:25.901
I said no visitors in the studio today.

00:49:25.984 --> 00:49:29.613
-Can't she take a hint?
-It won't take long. She'll leave soon.

00:49:29.696 --> 00:49:32.240
Whatever. Just finish it already
and send her away.

00:49:32.324 --> 00:49:34.993
-Making time for us wasn't easy, you know.
-I know.

00:49:35.077 --> 00:49:37.621
Take it lightly
and I might actually kill you.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.211
Your husband already came by earlier.

00:49:45.504 --> 00:49:47.589
-Did he buy Verite Merlot?
-Yes.

00:49:48.131 --> 00:49:50.258
-How many bottles did he get?
-Just one.

00:49:50.759 --> 00:49:52.219
I'll take another, please.

00:49:52.302 --> 00:49:53.345
Sure.

00:49:53.428 --> 00:49:54.721
One moment, please.

00:51:04.457 --> 00:51:05.876
What the…? At this time of night?

00:51:09.045 --> 00:51:10.255
God, it's cold.

00:51:16.052 --> 00:51:18.555
Just how long
has he been etching those copperplates?

00:51:25.478 --> 00:51:26.396
What is this?

00:52:08.605 --> 00:52:13.401
"A," a teacher charged
with killing her husband in his studio,

00:52:13.485 --> 00:52:16.446
was sentenced to life in prison
by the district court.

00:52:16.529 --> 00:52:20.033
The court stated that the crime
was not only premeditated and brutal,

00:52:20.116 --> 00:52:23.745
but it also severed family ties,

00:52:23.828 --> 00:52:26.623
and regarded it as a serious offense.

00:52:27.123 --> 00:52:30.919
Meanwhile, after the court's verdict,

00:52:31.002 --> 00:52:33.171
"A" adamantly denied the charges

00:52:33.255 --> 00:52:34.839
and protested her innocence.

00:52:34.923 --> 00:52:36.675
His heart has already stopped.

00:52:36.758 --> 00:52:38.510
It was just the electrical pulses.

00:52:39.010 --> 00:52:42.889
Furthermore, "A" protested her innocence
in the courtroom.

00:52:43.390 --> 00:52:46.768
She pleaded with the judge
to uncover the truth

00:52:46.851 --> 00:52:48.812
and claimed her innocence
until the very end.

00:52:48.895 --> 00:52:49.813
MY ONE AND ONLY SON

00:52:49.896 --> 00:52:52.190
I THINK I'LL BE AN HOUR LATE
GO AHEAD AND EAT FIRST

00:52:54.651 --> 00:52:57.487
Diva, don't lick that. It's yucky.

00:53:00.115 --> 00:53:03.368
Diva, I said don't eat that. It's icky.

00:53:06.788 --> 00:53:09.416
SON, DON'T BE TOO LATE
LET'S HAVE THE BIRTHDAY CAKE TOGETHER

00:53:09.499 --> 00:53:10.959
…blood on printmaking tools,

00:53:11.626 --> 00:53:15.213
and the unusual behavior "A" displayed
after her husband's death

00:53:15.297 --> 00:53:18.300
were the deciding factors
in the court's verdict.

00:53:19.634 --> 00:53:22.095
Just before "A" boarded
the prisoner transport vehicle,

00:53:22.178 --> 00:53:25.557
she addressed the press
and denied her charges once more,

00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:27.392
pleading her innocence.

00:53:31.229 --> 00:53:33.064
I didn't kill him.

00:53:33.148 --> 00:53:34.899
It wasn't me!

00:53:34.983 --> 00:53:35.859
Please.

00:53:35.942 --> 00:53:38.445
Someone, please believe me. It's not me!

00:53:38.528 --> 00:53:40.071
No one will believe me.

00:53:40.572 --> 00:53:43.158
I didn't kill him. It wasn't me, so why…

00:58:07.630 --> 00:58:12.635
