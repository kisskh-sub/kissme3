Hello.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:37.550
Where are you now?

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.320
Nearby. Five minutes.

00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:40.840
You pulled two all-nighters.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:41.710
You must be exhausted.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:43.640
In our line of work,

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.688
who doesn't stay up late?

00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:45.510
I'm used to it.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.280
Once the proposal is approved,

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.622
I'll catch up on beauty sleep.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.670
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.280
Just perform as you normally do.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.080
With your ability, you've got this.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.430
By the way, I sent you Tongchen's info.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.270
Take a look.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.840
Hello?

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:01.840
Can you hear me?

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:03.350

The people from Tongchen
are already here.

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.190
Ms. Shen has gone in.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.270
Okay.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.240
- Morning, Jin.
- Morning.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.960
Jin, your coffee.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.390
You're here. Hurry.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:35.600
Let me introduce you quickly.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.920
This is Tongchen Technology's
tech partner,

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.870
Mr. Li.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.160
He's also a recently returned

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.000
rising star in tech.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.630
And this is my Creative Director,

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.000
and also my partner,

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.360
Ms. Cen.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:52.630
Hello, I'm Cen Jin.

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.270
Li Wu.

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:59.390
Wu, as in mist.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.000
Let's begin directly.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.320
Okay.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.490
I'll give a brief overview first.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.680
In this "Earth at the Critical Point"

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.840
Environmental Art Exhibition,

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.390
we want to start from the theme

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:25.510
of "bond".

00:05:25.822 --> 00:05:27.911
Exploring the bond between
Earth and humanity,

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.377
and the bond among all living things.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.680
Humans and the natural world

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.190
are not isolated or separate.

00:05:44.755 --> 00:05:46.310
Humans and mountains, rivers, seas,

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:47.510
plants and forests,

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:48.830
and all animals,

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.870
we've always been part of nature.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.430
All living beings are interlinked

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:54.750
and interdependent.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.270
It's just that many times,

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.120
we forget this connection.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:14.780
(Exhibition Highlights)

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.680
I went to the nearby mall

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.022
and bought you a digital watch.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:40.150
That's all.

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.310
This is the core of our promo plan.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.000
As the proposal progresses,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000
we'll continue to add on,

00:06:45.044 --> 00:06:46.000
and refine the details.

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:47.030
Thank you, everyone.

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:49.030
Sorry about that.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.350
But I think this really suits him.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.070
I'd like to ask,

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:01.040
what Ms. Cen mentioned

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.880
about the bond between
humans and all beings...

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:03.750
I'm wondering

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:05.180
if just a few images would be enough

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.310
to clearly convey the concept

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:07.360
at our exhibition?

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.870
We certainly can't rely solely

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.920
on a few images to convey

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.480
the deeper meaning of "bond".

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:19.720
At the exhibition,

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:21.160
we'll have multi-media

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.000
presentations,

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:23.750
interactive experiences,

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.000
as well as physical exhibits

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:25.840
and other formats,

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.310
working together

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:28.750
to build the rich meaning

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:29.590
of the theme "bond".

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.360
So visitors can understand

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.070
the deeper significance behind it.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.070
Ms. Cen, how do you view

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:39.870
the meaning of the word "bond"?

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.560
To me, a bond

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.950
is the connection
and entanglement between lives.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.800
It's something you can't cut off,

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:53.977
a responsibility and a tie.

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:57.000
Like a kite held by a string.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:58.977
Even if the wind blows it far away,

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:00.160
you won't worry

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.000
that it'll lose its direction or fall.

00:08:03.355 --> 00:08:04.750
As long as the string is unbroken,

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:07.390
the bond will continue to exist.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:11.310
Of course,

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:12.920
a bond isn't limited

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.830
to emotional ties between people.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:16.480
So...

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.190
So, does that mean for you, Ms. Cen,

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.310
that if this string is cut,

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:24.066
whether by storms or by someone's hand,

00:08:24.288 --> 00:08:25.240
all the ties within it

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.600
will completely disappear?

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:33.270
Then, for something intangible,
like feelings,

00:08:33.555 --> 00:08:34.711
how would you determine

00:08:34.733 --> 00:08:35.440
whether it exists?

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:45.390
It's alright.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:46.320
I was just asking

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.390
a small question of my own.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:49.720
You don't have to rush

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:50.644
to answer me, Ms. Cen.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.440
Going forward, Tongchen and Shengcan

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.044
will have a long period of cooperation.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.240
I hope that through

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.120
our joint efforts,

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.550
we can interpret the word "bond"

00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:58.600
in a better,

00:08:59.030 --> 00:08:59.870
deeper way.

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:02.870
Thank you in advance, Mr. Li.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.320
Li.

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:21.470
Li.

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:24.630
Not here?

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:26.240
Li, where's your grandson?

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.040
Li.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.200
Alright, thanks.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.280
I'm not thirsty.

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:04.670
Yan.

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:05.510
Okay.

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.120
You're called Li Wu, right?

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:11.320
We're here to help you.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.320
Sit.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.160
Li Wu.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.870
This is Mr. Wu.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.600
This is Ms. Cen.

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:19.630
Ms. Cen

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:20.960
is actually Mr. Cen's daughter.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.080
The two of them

00:10:22.088 --> 00:10:23.270
came all the way from Yi City

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:24.110
just for this.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:26.560
Hello.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.550
Very polite, too.

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:30.080
Good grades as well.

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:31.480
Top of the class every year.

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:34.200
Show them off a bit, won't you?

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:35.560
No need.

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:39.270
It's really

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:40.480
hot here.

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:41.720
Though the air is good.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.160
Hey.

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.320
Where are you?

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:54.750
I'm in the restroom.

00:10:55.977 --> 00:10:57.340
What about the Tongchen people?

00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:58.940
I just saw them off.

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:01.140
Seems like they're

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:02.355
pretty satisfied with the plan.

00:11:02.688 --> 00:11:03.980
Do you have plans for tonight?

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:06.460
If not,

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:07.420
I thought we could

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:08.600
treat them to dinner tonight.

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:10.650
Try to finalize the contract
as soon as possible.

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:11.900
Alright.

00:12:25.444 --> 00:12:27.377
Do you really understand
what a "bond" is?

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:37.340
Love is,

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:40.820
hate is too.

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.220
But ignoring it is not.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:12:59.460
All these years,

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:00.755
you never contacted me once.

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:43.340
Sorry. I couldn't make it
to the afternoon meeting on time.

00:13:43.355 --> 00:13:44.866
Let me first make a toast to everyone.

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:46.220
Thanks, Mr. Cheng.

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:56.940
You must be starving.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:57.900
Dig in.

00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:58.419
Alright.

00:13:58.420 --> 00:13:59.780
This yellow croaker with rice cake

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:01.060
is the signature dish here.

00:14:01.111 --> 00:14:02.980
Normally, you can't get it
unless you reserve.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:04.100
Try it quickly.

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:05.100
Alright.

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.200
This goose liver lotus root sandwich
is also famous.

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:10.980
Yes.

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:12.155
This one's delicious too.

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:19.940
Ms. Shen,

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.140
so for our next project,

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:24.020
will you be the one
coordinating with us?

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:25.380
For a big project like Tongchen,

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:27.780
everyone in our company
will definitely be involved.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:30.260
But it will be Ms. Cen

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:31.740
who takes full responsibility.

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:32.700
Full control.

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:35.300
Don't be fooled by Ms. Cen's young age.

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:36.660
She is very capable.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.640
Previously,
for the Bingdian Technology promotions,

00:14:38.644 --> 00:14:39.911
did you pay attention to them?

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:41.380
That was fully managed

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:42.660
by Ms. Cen.

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:44.900
That's perfect.

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:46.340
We thank you in advance.

00:14:46.733 --> 00:14:47.800
This is what we should do.

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:48.940
So should we...

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:54.060
We will give 100% effort,

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:55.460
striving to do our best.

00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:59.060
Let's make a toast to the two of you.

00:15:00.266 --> 00:15:02.540
- Here, thank you, Mr. Li.
- Cheers to a good collaboration.

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:03.540
Thanks, Mr. Cheng.

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:04.660
- Cheers.
- Thanks.

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:15.460
You've been quiet

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:16.180
all night.

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:17.020
What's wrong?

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:18.500
Nothing.

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:20.380
Ms. Shen.

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:21.060
Jin.

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:22.140
My friend came to pick me up,

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:23.133
so I'll head off first.

00:15:23.155 --> 00:15:23.420
Okay.

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:23.700
Bye.

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:24.540
Stay safe.

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:24.920
Okay.

00:15:26.111 --> 00:15:27.220
I also called a driver.

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:28.060
How are you leaving?

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:29.780
I also booked a car.

00:15:30.311 --> 00:15:31.460
Why didn't you ask Dr. Lu

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:32.300
to pick you up?

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:34.780
It's too late.

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:36.700
What's late about it?

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:38.140
You don't know how much

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:40.100
he loves opportunities like this.

00:15:43.977 --> 00:15:44.820
My driver is here.

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:45.660
I'll go first.

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:46.660
Okay.

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:49.349
See you next time.

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:50.577
All right.

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:52.180
Leaving.

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:17.500
Ms. Cen Jin,

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:18.620
we'll leave first.

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:19.620
See you next time.

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:20.780
Bye.

00:16:30.844 --> 00:16:32.940
You deliberately acted
like you didn't know her

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:34.380
and made me feel awkward.

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:36.580
No, I didn't.

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:38.340
Still denying it?

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:40.340
Your face was stiff like plaster.

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:42.020
Really, I didn't.

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:43.380
"Really, I didn't."

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:45.340
Come on, stop lying to me.

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:48.300
Today, you insisted

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:49.222
on coming here, right?

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:50.860
Since you're here, be carefree.

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:52.540
We'll still be collaborating later.

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:53.380
Du,

00:16:53.888 --> 00:16:55.260
stop at the intersection ahead.

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:56.020
Okay.

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:57.060
Alright, I won't say more.

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:06.340
Ms. Shen created a work group.

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:07.340
You should reply too.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:12.060
(Ms. Shen: Thank you for your trust.)

00:17:12.066 --> 00:17:13.933
(Looking forward
to a pleasant collaboration.)

00:17:13.977 --> 00:17:17.020
(Zhang Xiaojiao: Win-win)

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:24.380
(Moments)

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:35.380
Lend me your phone.

00:17:36.577 --> 00:17:37.700
I'll return it later.

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:41.020
(Good friends meeting)

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:47.260
(Passion never cools)

00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:00.460
(Believe in yourself. You can
become whoever you want to be.)

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:02.300
(New experience: Today I'm an archer.)

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.300
(New experience: Today I'm an archer.)

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:18.460
Who's that guy?

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:21.820
Jin's boyfriend?

00:18:32.333 --> 00:18:34.340
(Why didn't you call Dr. Lu
to pick you up?)

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:35.380
(You don't know)

00:18:35.488 --> 00:18:37.260
(how much he loves
opportunities like this.)

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:43.580
Done using my phone?

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:56.288
(Chun Chang: What's going on?)

00:18:56.333 --> 00:18:58.000
(He's not really divorcing, right?)

00:18:58.500 --> 00:18:59.980
(He's so heartless.)

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:01.300
(Ungrateful scum.)

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:13.100
Hey.

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:19.460
Hello.

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:26.260
Is this Ms. Cen Jin?

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:31.180
May I ask who this is?

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:34.580
I'm Li Wu.

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:36.140
Liwu?

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:40.060
Who are you?

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:42.700
I'm a student from Yunfeng Village

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:45.660
who was sponsored by Mr. Cen before.

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:50.460
Hello?

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:51.300
Are you still there?

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:54.140
I'm here.

00:19:54.733 --> 00:19:56.260
May I ask why you're contacting me?

00:19:58.260 --> 00:19:59.700
Sorry to bother you.

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:01.380
Well...

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:03.500
Last year,

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:05.620
for some reason,

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:07.444
I couldn't take
the college entrance exam.

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:10.580
I still want to continue studying.

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:17.780
Could you help me?

00:20:18.266 --> 00:20:19.733
You didn't continue your studies?

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:22.620
I remember the tuition was sent on time

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:23.900
to your grandfather's account.

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:27.340
My grandfather passed away a year ago.

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:30.540
I'm sorry.

00:20:32.111 --> 00:20:34.020
I'm living with my aunt now.

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.540
(Banling)
Last year, my uncle told me our family

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:38.060
was struggling.

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:40.060
Around the time of the exam,

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:42.380
he pulled me out to work.

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:45.300
So, I completely missed the exam.

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:49.180
This year, I want

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:50.300
to resume studying.

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:51.620
Go back to school.

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:53.620
But...

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:56.580
they wouldn't allow it.

00:20:58.740 --> 00:20:59.900
I called Mr. Wu.

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:02.540
He told me to contact you.

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:05.660
What does that mean?

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:07.340
I don't know either.

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:09.300
But he said

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:11.780
that you two have separated.

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:14.420
So...

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:16.860
he gave me your contact information.

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:19.260
Wait a moment.

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:20.900
I'll call him.

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:25.100
This is me

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:26.060
using a borrowed phone.

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:27.780
Two minutes.

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:37.940
(Yiwen Creative Dream)

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:45.740
What's wrong?

00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:47.060
The kid from Shengzhou

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:47.980
called me.

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:50.100
You just pushed it onto me?

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:52.460
This was started by your father.

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:53.460
How to decide

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:54.711
is also your family's matter.

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:56.220
Aren't you involved?

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:57.780
We all are.

00:21:58.340 --> 00:21:59.940
So I leave the decision to you.

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:01.340
Of course.

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:03.340
You can still be a good person.

00:22:03.377 --> 00:22:05.111
After all, you've always been so noble.

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:06.740
This concerns a child's

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:07.620
life-altering matter.

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:08.780
How can you speak

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:09.740
so lightly?

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:11.340
Don't you find it cruel?

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:12.620
You don't understand

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:13.460
these kinds of kids.

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:14.820
But I've seen many.

00:22:15.022 --> 00:22:16.980
Kids who voluntarily give up
the exam to work.

00:22:17.022 --> 00:22:19.288
They want to earn money
but find the work too hard.

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:20.940
Now, in front of you,

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:23.111
pitifully, wanting to go back
to study for college.

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:25.740
Wu Fu,

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:27.940
you don't have to speak so harshly.

00:22:28.244 --> 00:22:29.820
Not everyone lives as easily as you.

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:31.220
Life isn't that simple for everyone.

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:32.780
He wants to move forward,

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:34.700
so he must endure
the hardships he faces.

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:36.140
If he can't persevere,

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:36.980
whose fault is it?

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:39.100
Besides, I've seen

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:39.940
that contract.

00:22:40.088 --> 00:22:41.220
Even if we don't manage it,

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:42.460
someone else will take over.

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:44.460
So, in your eyes,

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:46.580
human relationships

00:22:46.644 --> 00:22:48.780
are just contracts that can
be terminated anytime?

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:50.100
In your heart,

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:52.644
our relationship is
the same thing, right?

00:22:52.755 --> 00:22:53.260
Alright.

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:54.533
I don't want to argue with you.

00:22:54.555 --> 00:22:56.500
I'm still working. I'll hang up.

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:23.755
Who are you looking for?

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:28.180
Where is the boy
who was using your phone just now?

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:31.660
I've already left.

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:34.340
The car has arrived. I can't wait.

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:37.020
It's fine now.

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:48.900
(Shengzhou)

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:07.980
(Yunfeng)

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:41.820
Sorry.

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:42.940
(Yunfeng Village Party Committee)

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:44.439
Excuse me, may I ask

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:45.700
if Mr. Yan Changsheng is here?

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:47.620
You mean Mayor Yan?

00:24:47.711 --> 00:24:49.300
He's already been promoted to mayor?

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:51.420
Right, I'm looking for him.

00:24:51.555 --> 00:24:52.700
He hasn't been in charge

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:53.733
of work in our village

00:24:53.733 --> 00:24:54.755
since last year.

00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:56.500
No problem.

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.740
I'm just a reserve cadre
in this village.

00:24:58.980 --> 00:24:59.980
What do you need him for?

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:01.100
I can help you register.

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:03.060
Okay.

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:03.900
Here's the situation.

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:06.660
I'm looking for a child.

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:08.940
His name is Li Wu.

00:25:12.377 --> 00:25:13.444
A couple of years ago,

00:25:13.444 --> 00:25:15.530
when my father went
to the countryside for research,

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:17.111
he learned about Li Wu's situation

00:25:17.111 --> 00:25:18.340
and became his sponsor.

00:25:18.422 --> 00:25:19.780
I helped him with some procedures.

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:22.100
I heard he recently

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:23.020
had some trouble,

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:24.540
so I came to check on him.

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:26.420
I know Li Wu.

00:25:27.266 --> 00:25:28.577
Come, I'll take you there.

00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:30.580
May I ask your name?

00:25:30.933 --> 00:25:31.820
My name is Cheng Lixue.

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:32.933
You can just call me Cheng.

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:34.180
Thank you, Ms. Cheng.

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:40.340
Slow down, the road is slippery.

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:42.380
Uncle.

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:43.220
Busy, huh?

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:45.220
Turn ahead.

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:46.300
That's Li Wu's aunt's house.

00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:49.700
Uncle.

00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:50.980
Busy, huh?

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.088
After Li Wu's grandfather passed away,

00:25:54.111 --> 00:25:54.900
has he always lived

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:55.740
with his aunt?

00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:57.500
Yes, he lived there all along.

00:25:57.980 --> 00:25:59.260
After missing the college exam,

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:00.020
he got his diploma

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:01.380
and his uncle sent him to the mine

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:02.340
to work and earn money.

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:04.620
It's such a pity for this kid.

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:06.380
His grades were always excellent.

00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:08.180
He's smart and hardworking,

00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:09.020
and kind-hearted.

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:11.260
If it weren't for his uncle,

00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:12.690
he would have already been admitted.

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:13.660
Such a bright future.

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:16.620
But our sponsorship funds

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:18.100
were always transferred on time

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:19.940
to the bank card.

00:26:22.955 --> 00:26:24.300
The child is alone and helpless,

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:25.990
so he needs relatives
to take care of him.

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:28.020
Ahead, we're almost there.

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:29.740
Run!

00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:30.860
Still running?

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:32.020
Where are you going?

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:33.180
Come here!

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.044
You scoundrel!
You're looking for death!

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:36.820
You've been freeloading for so long.

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:37.940
Now you want to run?

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:39.180
It's not that easy!

00:26:40.222 --> 00:26:40.820
Don't hit him.

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:41.660
Get lost!

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:42.380
Asking to get hit?

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:43.220
They're always like this.

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:44.060
Get lost!

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:45.340
Move aside!

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:48.260
Who let you run off?

00:26:50.577 --> 00:26:52.260
Who let you run off?

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:54.340
It's fine.

00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:55.540
I want to go.

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:56.580
You can't stop me.

00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:58.580
I'm not stopping you.

00:26:58.860 --> 00:26:59.700
Secretary Cheng.

00:26:59.755 --> 00:27:01.340
Aunt, what's going on with these two?

00:27:01.355 --> 00:27:02.420
- Nothing.
- You're with me.

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:04.220
- Educating the kid.
- Eating my food. Give it back!

00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:04.940
Settle it all.

00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:06.180
Go wherever you want.

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:07.377
All my wages from the mine

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:08.111
are with you.

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:09.620
Talking back, huh?

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:11.020
Talking back, huh?

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:14.820
What? Want to hit me?

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:15.660
Li Wu.

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:18.620
Uncle, what are you doing?

00:27:19.733 --> 00:27:21.060
- Wu.
- This kid won't listen.

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:21.977
Just teach him a lesson.

00:27:21.977 --> 00:27:22.660
It's nothing.

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:23.980
Why don't you teach

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:25.044
your own child like this?

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:25.940
Who is she?

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:27.700
She's been helping

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:29.060
the kids in our village study.

00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:30.140
Mr. Cen's daughter.

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:31.100
She came to see Li Wu.

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:39.380
Do you remember me?

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:45.340
Yes, I remember.

00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:49.380
Can I talk to him alone?

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:53.740
Sure.

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:55.100
Wu, hurry.

00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:55.940
Your room.

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:04.540
Come. Uncle, have a seat.

00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:30.540
Hey, there's something on your mouth.

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:39.700
What's that?

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:41.420
A solar panel.

00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:44.180
There's no electricity inside.

00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:45.900
Did you make this yourself?

00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:53.820
You study here?

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:01.460
Can I take a look?

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:12.100
(High School Physics Olympiad
Real Exam Questions)

00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:13.540
Last year's mock test?

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:30.340
Do you still have

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:31.540
your grandfather's bank card?

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:42.100
It's with him?

00:29:45.577 --> 00:29:46.780
Alright, don't eat anymore.

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:48.140
You go over there

00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:48.980
and sit.

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:53.780
Let's eat the porridge together.

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:04.380
Secretary Cheng.

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:05.220
Have a seat.

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:06.780
Mom.

00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:07.660
Ms. Cen, sit here.

00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:08.500
Stop making noise.

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:09.340
Wu,

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:10.580
come eat.

00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:12.020
Mom.

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:12.860
Wu.

00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:16.100
I won't eat.

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:18.300
I'm here today for one thing.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.500
Why don't you let Li Wu go to college?

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:26.060
You'll even complain, huh?

00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:30.700
Look at my situation.

00:30:31.755 --> 00:30:33.777
Do I have money to send him to college?

00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:36.340
His old man is dead.

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:37.740
I'm the only labor left at home.

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:39.911
Secretary Cheng knows that.

00:30:40.733 --> 00:30:42.300
Do you think money falls from the sky?

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:44.260
So many mouths to feed at home.

00:30:44.644 --> 00:30:46.260
He's already graduated from high school.

00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:48.100
You want me to work my life away

00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:49.260
to send him to college?

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:50.700
Forget it.

00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:55.780
As far as I know,

00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:57.580
Li Wu's grandfather's inheritance

00:30:57.580 --> 00:30:58.420
is all in your hands.

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:00.500
Nonsense inheritance.

00:31:00.955 --> 00:31:02.220
Those two broken houses of his

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:03.066
aren't even enough

00:31:03.066 --> 00:31:04.288
to pay for his funeral.

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:05.780
Inheritance?

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:10.060
If you let him continue studying,

00:31:10.377 --> 00:31:11.660
tuition for repeating a year,

00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:13.620
including college tuition,

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:14.711
you won't have to worry.

00:31:14.977 --> 00:31:16.140
He has a good foundation.

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:18.000
If he focuses on studying,
he can definitely get in

00:31:18.022 --> 00:31:18.866
to a good school.

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:20.420
The return for you in the future

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:21.940
will only be more, not less.

00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:24.500
I can't wait.

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:26.740
The sooner he earns, the better.

00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:28.540
He's already an adult.

00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:30.260
Please respect his wishes.

00:31:30.377 --> 00:31:31.700
You don't need to tell me this.

00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:33.700
He lives here with me.

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:35.100
Eats my food, and drinks my drinks.

00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:36.660
He has to help earn money.

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:38.300
If I let him work,

00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:39.140
he goes to work.

00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:43.900
Don't think that having a backer

00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:44.740
changes anything.

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:46.340
College?

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:47.700
Don't even think about it.

00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:48.820
You're not meant to.

00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:56.460
Secretary Cheng.

00:31:56.977 --> 00:31:58.466
I'm going out for some air.

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:03.020
Uncle,

00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:03.860
let's reconsider.

00:32:03.977 --> 00:32:05.769
There's someone sponsoring
the kid's studies.

00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:07.280
In the future, when he's successful,

00:32:07.288 --> 00:32:08.300
he can earn more.

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:10.460
Let's think about it again, alright?

00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:11.580
No need to consider.

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:28.740
Ms. Cen.

00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:32.140
Relationships in this village,

00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:33.333
can be simple if you say so,

00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:34.820
or complicated if you say so.

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:36.780
But in the end,

00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:37.820
they are family.

00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:40.420
I know.

00:32:40.488 --> 00:32:43.020
It's been raining a lot lately.
They are also fixing roads here.

00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:44.620
It's unsafe to walk at night.

00:32:44.844 --> 00:32:46.309
I'll take you to have a meal first,

00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:48.550
and you can stay here for a night.
You can leave tomorrow.

00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:50.660
Alright.

00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:51.500
Thank you.

00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:52.900
Let's go.

00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:07.300
Watch your step.

00:33:10.622 --> 00:33:12.420
This is the place
where our village teacher

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:13.660
is staying for the time being.

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:15.260
I've already had someone clean up.

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:17.460
There's hot water in this thermos.

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:20.380
See if you need anything else.

00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:21.580
You can call me.

00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:24.020
Okay, thank you.

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:25.860
Alright, then rest early.

00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:27.100
I'm heading back
to the committee.

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:27.940
Okay, good night.

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:22.820
(Flashlight)

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:28.740
(Wu Fu, Divorce Agreement)

00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:30.820
(Wu Fu)

00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:34.020
(Divorce Agreement)

00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:35.266
(I've drafted the agreement.)

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:36.180
(Take a look first.)

00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:48.460
Who is it?

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:50.380
It's me.

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:51.700
Li Wu.

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:28.660
There are many mosquitoes
in the countryside.

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:31.180
I went to the village shop

00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:32.900
and bought some things you might need.

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:35.460
(Mosquito coils)

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:36.340
The power is out.

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:40.900
I was worried it would
be inconvenient for you.

00:37:42.733 --> 00:37:44.260
These will make things a bit easier.

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:50.780
Li Wu.

00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:54.380
Come in. Let's talk.

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:26.740
Why did you think of coming to me?

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:28.660
I want to continue studying.

00:38:30.155 --> 00:38:31.580
Only with success in my studies

00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:32.780
can I have the chance to repay

00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:33.977
those who treated me well.

00:38:36.444 --> 00:38:37.666
I don't want to give up.

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:43.860
I want to leave this mountain.

00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:45.620
So...

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:50.100
I want to try

00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:50.980
every possibility.

00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:55.860
Then next,

00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:57.220
what's your plan?

00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:00.140
I don't know either.

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:03.340
I just

00:39:04.866 --> 00:39:05.940
want to give it a try.

00:39:07.555 --> 00:39:08.777
Do you believe in fate?

00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:13.380
If someone told you,

00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:15.660
no matter what you do,

00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:17.740
you cannot change your fate,

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:20.300
would you believe it?

00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:23.260
No.

00:39:26.933 --> 00:39:28.140
I don't believe it either.

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:31.100
I only believe in myself.

00:39:34.711 --> 00:39:36.777
As long as one doesn't
give up on oneself,

00:39:37.844 --> 00:39:39.533
there's always a way to solve problems.

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:47.380
It's too late today.

00:39:47.511 --> 00:39:49.133
You should go back and rest.

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:56.340
Okay.

00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:57.420
Then I'll go.

00:39:57.888 --> 00:39:58.900
Be careful on the way.

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:13.740
Your door has no latch.

00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:15.100
It's okay.

00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:17.000
I'll block it with the table,
and that will do.
