00:00:10.181 --> 00:00:12.617
Did you name me "Koichi," Mom?

00:00:12.684 --> 00:00:15.587
My mom's explanation was vague.

00:00:16.221 --> 00:00:18.656
Rather than the origin of the name,

00:00:18.723 --> 00:00:22.460
what was more striking
was her speaking hesitantly.

00:00:22.527 --> 00:00:24.028
Kokura Racecourse, Race Five.

00:00:24.596 --> 00:00:26.030
The fanfare sounds, and the 16 horses…

00:00:26.097 --> 00:00:29.300
My mom watched horse racing
broadcasts almost every week.

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.372
When I asked her if she liked it,
she answered, "Not really."

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:37.208
But she kept staring, as if praying,

00:00:37.275 --> 00:00:39.577
whenever the Royal horses raced.

00:00:39.644 --> 00:00:41.713
Eat the meal I made for you, okay?

00:00:41.779 --> 00:00:44.149
-Okay.
-See you later.

00:00:47.886 --> 00:00:50.855
That's when I started learning
about horse racing.

00:00:50.922 --> 00:00:52.157
Thank you very much.

00:00:53.858 --> 00:00:57.929
It's been a year
since President Kozo Sanno passed away.

00:00:57.996 --> 00:01:03.134
How do you feel about having inherited
Royal Family and becoming a horse owner?

00:01:05.036 --> 00:01:06.371
It still…

00:01:07.372 --> 00:01:09.874
doesn't feel real.

00:01:09.941 --> 00:01:14.646
You also inherited
your father's dream of winning the Arima.

00:01:14.712 --> 00:01:16.481
Are you determined?

00:01:19.317 --> 00:01:20.485
It's my mission.

00:01:21.152 --> 00:01:23.655
I think of it as my mission.

00:01:23.721 --> 00:01:24.822
INHERITANCE

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:27.859
-I'm really sorry.
-Why?

00:01:27.926 --> 00:01:29.460
I couldn't speak well at all.

00:01:29.527 --> 00:01:32.530
No. You did great.

00:01:32.597 --> 00:01:35.900
The President never really answered
reporters' questions properly.

00:01:37.268 --> 00:01:38.403
I see.

00:01:42.273 --> 00:01:45.176
There is still time
before the auction begins.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.146
You should go and look around.

00:01:48.213 --> 00:01:51.282
The scale and facilities here
are unparalleled.

00:01:56.387 --> 00:01:57.288
Is something wrong?

00:01:58.022 --> 00:02:01.759
I was wondering
what kind of expression I should have.

00:02:03.595 --> 00:02:05.663
That of a horse owner.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.333
But I'm an inheritance-only horse owner.

00:02:09.467 --> 00:02:11.069
A horse owner who can't buy horses.

00:02:11.135 --> 00:02:13.738
It's true that you can't buy a new horse,

00:02:13.805 --> 00:02:16.241
but you can learn from
everything you witness here.

00:02:16.808 --> 00:02:21.112
Eventually, you will be competing
with the horses of the people here.

00:02:28.653 --> 00:02:31.723
Chairman, that seat is already filled.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.291
This seat?

00:02:33.358 --> 00:02:34.259
Oh, no.

00:02:34.325 --> 00:02:36.894
I always watch from here.

00:02:36.961 --> 00:02:37.795
Sorry.

00:02:38.596 --> 00:02:39.797
I didn't know it was designated.

00:02:39.864 --> 00:02:41.532
No, it's not.

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.468
It brings luck here.

00:02:43.534 --> 00:02:45.770
Chairman Watabe, it's been a while.

00:02:45.837 --> 00:02:47.472
Aren't you Kozo's…

00:02:47.538 --> 00:02:49.474
Nice to see you. I'm Kurisu.

00:02:50.875 --> 00:02:52.844
Sorry, it's his first time here.

00:02:53.745 --> 00:02:55.713
Sold for 120 million yen.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.049
Customer Number 16,
thank you for your purchase.

00:02:58.116 --> 00:02:59.150
What?

00:02:59.217 --> 00:03:02.153
I just thought you were so enthusiastic.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.790
-Our next horse is Number 43.
-I have to do this much, at least.

00:03:06.658 --> 00:03:08.226
Thoridin, 2022.

00:03:08.293 --> 00:03:13.598
Male, bay, born on April 15th,
sired by Lime Cut.

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:17.268
-His sire was skilled at long-distance…
-Are you interested?

00:03:17.335 --> 00:03:19.270
The dam's line steadily turns out winners.

00:03:19.337 --> 00:03:21.906
If I were an ordinary horse owner,
I'd definitely buy it.

00:03:21.973 --> 00:03:25.943
The bloodline is interesting.
I think it will fetch a pretty high price.

00:03:26.511 --> 00:03:29.380
-Yes!
-That's something to look forward to.

00:03:29.947 --> 00:03:33.518
-38 million?
-Yes!

00:03:33.584 --> 00:03:34.652
38 million!

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:37.055
-39 million?
-Yes!

00:03:37.121 --> 00:03:39.824
39 million! Do I have 40 million?

00:03:39.891 --> 00:03:43.294
40 million?

00:03:43.361 --> 00:03:44.495
Any other bids?

00:03:44.562 --> 00:03:46.230
It’s not going as high as expected.

00:03:46.297 --> 00:03:49.100
40 million?

00:03:49.167 --> 00:03:50.068
Last call.

00:03:50.134 --> 00:03:51.069
40 million.

00:03:51.135 --> 00:03:52.603
Do we have 40 million?

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.940
All right!

00:03:56.007 --> 00:03:59.944
-What? Is it okay for it to be this cheap?
-Sold for 39 million.

00:04:00.011 --> 00:04:02.280
-Customer Number 350.
-Here.

00:04:02.347 --> 00:04:03.648
Mr. Aiso?

00:04:06.651 --> 00:04:09.854
-His son? Mr. Shiina's?
-Yes.

00:04:10.421 --> 00:04:13.057
I was reassigned to him this year.

00:04:13.124 --> 00:04:14.992
Oh, I see.

00:04:16.861 --> 00:04:19.864
Are things going well, Mr. Kurisu?

00:04:19.931 --> 00:04:20.798
What?

00:04:20.865 --> 00:04:22.367
With your young horse owner?

00:04:23.101 --> 00:04:26.771
Is there any generational gap?

00:04:26.838 --> 00:04:28.840
A gap?

00:04:28.906 --> 00:04:30.375
So there isn't, huh?

00:04:31.109 --> 00:04:34.278
-Um… Excuse me.
-Oh, sorry.

00:04:34.345 --> 00:04:37.148
You're the owner of Royal Family, right?

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:39.183
Koichi Nakajo.

00:04:40.017 --> 00:04:40.885
Yes.

00:04:41.686 --> 00:04:42.920
I knew it!

00:04:43.521 --> 00:04:46.624
Oh, my name is Nobuyuki Shiina.

00:04:46.691 --> 00:04:48.259
SHIINA'S SON

00:04:51.662 --> 00:04:52.697
Shiina?

00:04:52.764 --> 00:04:54.932
It's a small company, though.

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:58.703
It's my first auction
as a licensed horse owner.

00:04:59.637 --> 00:05:01.773
Congratulations on that.

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:04.509
I want to connect
with owners around my age.

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:07.578
Can I ask for your contact information?

00:05:08.613 --> 00:05:10.081
Sure, why not?

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:17.889
-You picked a good horse.
-What?

00:05:18.723 --> 00:05:19.624
Earlier.

00:05:20.892 --> 00:05:22.727
I think that horse is going to be great.

00:05:24.061 --> 00:05:25.663
Its parents aren't well-known,

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.566
but if you trace back
the generations before them,

00:05:29.133 --> 00:05:31.035
they have a pretty interesting bloodline.

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:32.970
Right?

00:05:33.538 --> 00:05:36.007
You really know your stuff!

00:05:37.008 --> 00:05:41.312
This is the restaurant the President
took me to when we first met.

00:05:41.913 --> 00:05:43.181
-Excuse me!
-Yes?

00:05:43.247 --> 00:05:45.917
-Another two servings of this, please.
-Coming right up.

00:05:45.983 --> 00:05:49.153
One after the other, like this.
No questions asked.

00:05:49.687 --> 00:05:51.422
Please, eat.

00:05:51.489 --> 00:05:53.124
"CEO."

00:05:53.191 --> 00:05:54.692
It's remarkable, right?

00:05:56.427 --> 00:05:58.763
Even though he's not much older than me.

00:06:01.232 --> 00:06:03.100
I feel it painfully.

00:06:04.202 --> 00:06:07.271
My position as a limited horse owner.

00:06:10.541 --> 00:06:12.810
I don't have a horse that I bought myself.

00:06:13.578 --> 00:06:17.548
Just raising Family
has me struggling financially.

00:06:19.217 --> 00:06:20.718
Here is your order.

00:06:24.755 --> 00:06:27.892
He's what a horse owner should be like.

00:06:29.694 --> 00:06:31.329
-Koichi.
-But I…

00:06:34.131 --> 00:06:35.700
I don't live in that world.

00:06:36.934 --> 00:06:40.304
All I need to do is focus

00:06:42.373 --> 00:06:43.875
on Family, right?

00:06:48.312 --> 00:06:49.847
Generational shift.

00:06:49.914 --> 00:06:53.985
The world of horse racing
has seen many generational shifts.

00:06:54.051 --> 00:06:58.155
While fans and those involved hope
for the continued health of older horses,

00:06:58.222 --> 00:07:01.058
they also have high hopes
for the emergence of new horses.

00:07:01.125 --> 00:07:04.295
Most racehorses retire
around the age of five.

00:07:04.362 --> 00:07:05.830
Depending on the horse's performance,

00:07:05.897 --> 00:07:08.599
they will become
breeding studs or broodmares.

00:07:09.166 --> 00:07:12.937
There is no upper age limit for owners.
As long as they have the will

00:07:13.004 --> 00:07:15.973
and financial means to continue,
they will not be forced to retire.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.210
What is essential for a horse owner?
Financial strength?

00:07:19.277 --> 00:07:20.378
Connections?

00:07:20.444 --> 00:07:21.379
Or…

00:07:21.445 --> 00:07:24.916
SO PERFECT

00:07:25.917 --> 00:07:26.817
Inheritance.

00:07:26.884 --> 00:07:28.019
Article 12.

00:07:28.519 --> 00:07:32.823
Royal Family, who inherited the will
of Kozo Sanno and Royal Hope,

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:37.828
won his debut race but then suffered
a series of minor injuries,

00:07:37.895 --> 00:07:40.831
causing him to miss the Spring
Classic races as a three-year-old.

00:07:40.898 --> 00:07:42.366
Then fall came.

00:07:42.433 --> 00:07:45.269
While horses of the same generation
were winning distinguished races,

00:07:45.336 --> 00:07:48.806
Family was still stuck
in the two-win class.

00:07:48.873 --> 00:07:52.243
Number Ten is leading and crossing
the finish line in first place!

00:07:53.477 --> 00:07:57.415
Despite being fully prepared
for this race, he finished in fifth place.

00:07:57.481 --> 00:07:59.116
Sorry, I couldn't go to the front.

00:07:59.183 --> 00:08:01.152
Still, you came in fifth place.

00:08:01.819 --> 00:08:03.688
I should have forced myself to go wide.

00:08:03.754 --> 00:08:07.091
I talked to Ryujiro, and we're thinking
of pushing our race schedule up.

00:08:07.158 --> 00:08:10.628
I think Family's condition
will improve if he keeps running.

00:08:11.262 --> 00:08:12.263
There you have it.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.165
-Next time, I'll push harder.
-Yes.

00:08:14.899 --> 00:08:19.036
You don't have to push so hard.

00:08:20.271 --> 00:08:22.440
It's okay to monitor
the situation gradually.

00:08:22.506 --> 00:08:25.977
Well, he got started late,
so isn't it time to work hard?

00:08:26.043 --> 00:08:29.380
However, in the next race,
Family lost momentum in the final stretch

00:08:29.447 --> 00:08:31.649
and dropped further down the rankings.

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:34.118
The young owner,

00:08:34.185 --> 00:08:37.388
who inherited Sanno's ardent dream
of winning the Arima Kinen,

00:08:37.455 --> 00:08:39.991
is already facing a time of trial.

00:08:40.591 --> 00:08:43.260
So if you start to waver…

00:08:53.738 --> 00:08:56.107
-Change jockeys?
-Yes.

00:08:56.674 --> 00:08:58.275
I'd like to try changing jockeys.

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:00.411
Is that a bad idea?

00:09:01.012 --> 00:09:03.881
I think that with more experience,

00:09:03.948 --> 00:09:07.852
he has the potential
to compete in higher classes.

00:09:08.886 --> 00:09:11.555
I think so too.

00:09:11.622 --> 00:09:14.592
However, if we were to change jockeys now,

00:09:15.259 --> 00:09:17.194
Family might get confused.

00:09:17.728 --> 00:09:18.562
Koichi.

00:09:19.597 --> 00:09:23.534
Can you tell us what you
are trying to achieve?

00:09:24.435 --> 00:09:25.670
That's…

00:09:28.639 --> 00:09:30.908
Even if he keeps
gaining experience like this,

00:09:32.543 --> 00:09:34.612
I don't think things will change.

00:09:34.679 --> 00:09:38.616
Even so, I don't think
the issue lies with Ryujiro.

00:09:38.683 --> 00:09:40.251
That’s true…

00:09:40.951 --> 00:09:43.821
Ryujiro is one of the top jockeys.

00:09:44.355 --> 00:09:46.724
He not only has experience
and competitive instinct,

00:09:47.224 --> 00:09:49.260
but also a deep understanding of the team.

00:09:49.827 --> 00:09:53.297
I think having him on board
is a big advantage for us.

00:09:53.364 --> 00:09:55.466
I know that, too.

00:09:57.568 --> 00:09:58.469
But…

00:10:00.071 --> 00:10:02.673
It's like we're trying
to match Family with Ryujiro.

00:10:03.474 --> 00:10:07.678
I'd like to try going at Family's pace.

00:10:08.579 --> 00:10:12.650
Family missed the Spring three-year-old
race season due to injuries.

00:10:12.717 --> 00:10:16.187
If we don't pick up the pace now,
we'll never get any results.

00:10:16.253 --> 00:10:17.788
-Yes, but--
-Winning the Arima.

00:10:17.855 --> 00:10:20.091
We will fulfill
the President's wish, right?

00:10:23.327 --> 00:10:26.797
How about we wrap it up for today?

00:10:28.966 --> 00:10:32.136
Would it be okay to leave
the jockey issue on hold for now

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:35.706
and continue to consider the matter?

00:10:40.811 --> 00:10:43.180
I can't speak about horses,

00:10:44.849 --> 00:10:48.819
but I believe that Hope
was able to run in the Arima Kinen

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:51.989
thanks to the strength of this team.

00:10:53.023 --> 00:10:55.459
To win the Arima with a horse from Hidaka.

00:10:56.427 --> 00:10:57.695
Starting with Ryujiro,

00:10:58.429 --> 00:11:01.632
everyone on the team believed
in that without any hesitation.

00:11:02.633 --> 00:11:04.568
I think those feelings reached Hope.

00:11:06.337 --> 00:11:08.439
But he couldn't get to first place.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.108
I understand what you're saying,

00:11:11.976 --> 00:11:13.511
but Hope is Hope.

00:11:13.577 --> 00:11:16.013
I think Family has his own
unique way of racing.

00:11:22.119 --> 00:11:23.220
Koichi!

00:11:25.055 --> 00:11:26.657
I had a meeting with my trainer.

00:11:27.224 --> 00:11:28.526
Do you need a ride to Tokyo?

00:11:31.295 --> 00:11:32.897
Oh, no, not me.

00:11:32.963 --> 00:11:34.131
Please, go ahead.

00:11:35.466 --> 00:11:37.134
Am I being a nuisance?

00:11:37.201 --> 00:11:38.335
No.

00:11:38.402 --> 00:11:39.537
Thank you.

00:11:40.104 --> 00:11:41.906
-I’ll ride with you.
-What?

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:44.475
Oh, okay.

00:11:45.509 --> 00:11:46.677
Please take care.

00:11:49.079 --> 00:11:50.815
-See you.
-Take care.

00:11:51.582 --> 00:11:52.917
Thanks for this.

00:11:53.484 --> 00:11:56.153
I was surprised.
Did you have a meeting too?

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:04.662
Oh, right. I read them.

00:12:04.728 --> 00:12:06.197
The Tonichi Sports articles.

00:12:06.697 --> 00:12:08.432
-"Inheritance"?
-Yes.

00:12:08.499 --> 00:12:11.202
A newspaper serialization
is really something.

00:12:11.268 --> 00:12:12.870
I want one too.

00:12:12.937 --> 00:12:14.104
Thank you very much.

00:12:14.939 --> 00:12:16.807
I'll let the reporter know.

00:12:18.642 --> 00:12:19.610
Okay then.

00:12:20.344 --> 00:12:21.445
Thanks again.

00:12:23.047 --> 00:12:24.982
Oh, but you know…

00:12:25.716 --> 00:12:28.652
The title, "Inheritance,"
is a little bit old, right?

00:12:28.719 --> 00:12:31.622
Inheritance is just self-gratification
for the ones doing the passing.

00:12:31.689 --> 00:12:34.391
I don't care about
common sense or theories.

00:12:34.959 --> 00:12:38.195
I want them to listen to my ideas first.

00:12:38.796 --> 00:12:39.730
Don't you agree?

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.468
I do.

00:12:45.536 --> 00:12:47.738
-Good work, everyone!
-Thank you!

00:12:48.405 --> 00:12:50.708
-Goodbye!
-See you!

00:12:55.179 --> 00:12:56.780
Hello. This is Nakajo.

00:12:56.847 --> 00:12:59.116
Koichi? Are you done working?

00:13:04.021 --> 00:13:05.022
This way.

00:13:06.423 --> 00:13:08.125
Alcohol? What do you usually drink?

00:13:08.192 --> 00:13:09.526
Like, beer and stuff.

00:13:09.593 --> 00:13:12.529
Oh, nice. They serve everything.

00:13:13.464 --> 00:13:16.133
Sorry for the wait!

00:13:17.635 --> 00:13:20.638
This is Koichi Nakajo.

00:13:20.704 --> 00:13:22.606
-Nice to meet you.
-Welcome.

00:13:22.673 --> 00:13:24.341
To the Young Horse Owners' Association.

00:13:24.408 --> 00:13:26.377
-Young Horse Owners' Association?
-Sit.

00:13:26.443 --> 00:13:28.178
Here. Okay.

00:13:29.146 --> 00:13:34.385
So today, Koichi Nakajo has been invited

00:13:34.451 --> 00:13:37.187
to join us as our youngest member!

00:13:37.254 --> 00:13:38.255
Welcome!

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:42.359
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

00:13:42.426 --> 00:13:44.695
Okay, everyone.

00:13:46.196 --> 00:13:47.197
You too, Koichi.

00:13:47.798 --> 00:13:50.301
Congratulations on joining!

00:13:50.367 --> 00:13:53.237
-Cheers!
-On joining?

00:13:53.771 --> 00:13:56.140
Sticking to what's classic is fine.

00:13:56.206 --> 00:13:59.677
Wanting to preserve
formality and tradition.

00:13:59.743 --> 00:14:04.548
It's necessary to maintain
the grade of Japanese horse racing.

00:14:05.482 --> 00:14:10.721
But if we just want to protect it,
it will lead to a decline.

00:14:10.788 --> 00:14:13.791
We can't stop growing.

00:14:13.857 --> 00:14:15.859
He's spouting common sense.

00:14:15.926 --> 00:14:18.028
I can when I want to.

00:14:19.063 --> 00:14:21.398
But that common sense,

00:14:22.066 --> 00:14:25.336
if we make those comments
we come off as being cocky, right?

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:27.304
Yes.

00:14:29.139 --> 00:14:30.107
I agree.

00:14:30.174 --> 00:14:32.242
-Right?
-But…

00:14:32.309 --> 00:14:35.145
I don't mean to say anything strange.

00:14:35.713 --> 00:14:39.316
But when I talk,
they act like I can't read the room.

00:14:39.383 --> 00:14:41.085
That's the worst.

00:14:41.151 --> 00:14:43.487
They tell you,
"Do whatever you want," right?

00:14:45.222 --> 00:14:47.891
But that actually means,

00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:50.728
"Only to the extent
that I can understand."

00:14:51.295 --> 00:14:53.330
There’s a hidden meaning.

00:14:55.399 --> 00:14:56.300
That's true.

00:14:56.367 --> 00:14:58.369
They don't want to take responsibility.

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:01.872
Let's do as we please.

00:15:10.781 --> 00:15:12.349
-Excuse me.
-Good work.

00:15:20.157 --> 00:15:22.026
This is a column started by Nobuyuki.

00:15:22.092 --> 00:15:26.930
This article talks about something called
the "Young Horse Owners' Association."

00:15:26.997 --> 00:15:28.632
When did you become a member?

00:15:31.635 --> 00:15:34.738
A little while ago, at a dinner party.

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:41.445
What about it?

00:15:42.713 --> 00:15:46.383
Of course, I have no intention of
interfering in your social relationships,

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:49.253
but did you know that this group

00:15:49.319 --> 00:15:53.223
is not very well-regarded
by people in the same industry?

00:15:54.858 --> 00:15:55.993
No.

00:15:57.961 --> 00:16:00.931
The desire to change
the system is admirable,

00:16:00.998 --> 00:16:02.833
but Japanese horse racing

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:05.469
is not fragile enough
to be changed by performance.

00:16:05.536 --> 00:16:07.204
It's best to do it in moderation.

00:16:11.208 --> 00:16:12.376
Just as I thought.

00:16:13.077 --> 00:16:13.944
What?

00:16:14.011 --> 00:16:16.213
It is we…

00:16:17.681 --> 00:16:19.116
who need to read the room.

00:16:21.518 --> 00:16:22.920
Mr. Kurisu.

00:16:22.986 --> 00:16:25.389
Can't you be more on my side?

00:16:25.956 --> 00:16:27.458
Instead of being a go-between,

00:16:27.524 --> 00:16:30.194
I want you to stand with me
and fight alongside me.

00:16:31.095 --> 00:16:33.430
Fight? With who?

00:16:34.832 --> 00:16:36.133
With the team.

00:16:37.234 --> 00:16:40.003
No matter what I say,
no one takes me seriously.

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:42.206
-But if you say it, everyone--
-I'm sorry.

00:16:43.907 --> 00:16:47.311
Who we need to fight is not the team.

00:16:49.813 --> 00:16:50.948
Sorry.

00:16:53.117 --> 00:16:54.718
I'll be more careful from now on.

00:17:15.539 --> 00:17:17.541
THIRD PLACE / FIFTH PLACE / SEVENTH PLACE

00:17:17.608 --> 00:17:18.876
HORSE RACING BOOK

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.188
Both of them are waiting.

00:17:34.424 --> 00:17:35.526
Okay.

00:17:45.702 --> 00:17:47.905
-What are you doing?
-Shush!

00:17:49.873 --> 00:17:52.809
This is the new schedule
I came up with for Family.

00:17:53.677 --> 00:17:55.045
Unfortunately,

00:17:55.112 --> 00:17:59.616
I think Ryujiro is just too busy
to be Family's main jockey.

00:18:00.951 --> 00:18:05.355
So I would like to change the jockey
and reorganize the future race selections.

00:18:06.156 --> 00:18:07.157
Wait.

00:18:08.058 --> 00:18:12.095
It's not that easy finding a jockey
who can replace Ryujiro.

00:18:13.163 --> 00:18:14.064
I have a jockey.

00:18:15.065 --> 00:18:16.466
I can't think of any.

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:21.438
It's Shohei.

00:18:27.344 --> 00:18:30.581
Let me change his jockey to Shohei Nozaki.

00:18:30.647 --> 00:18:32.182
Wait a minute.

00:18:32.783 --> 00:18:35.852
When I watch Shohei
at the training center,

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:39.423
I think he suits Family
better than anyone else.

00:18:39.489 --> 00:18:40.324
Have you…

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:41.458
I mean…

00:18:42.726 --> 00:18:44.795
Have you spoken to him about this?

00:18:45.529 --> 00:18:46.930
No, not yet.

00:18:46.997 --> 00:18:49.433
In that case, there's no need
to rush into a decision.

00:18:49.499 --> 00:18:53.270
Let’s listen to everyone
and find a good middle ground together.

00:18:53.337 --> 00:18:54.805
How long will you postpone it?

00:18:54.871 --> 00:18:56.139
It's not like that.

00:18:56.206 --> 00:18:57.174
Excuse me.

00:18:57.241 --> 00:18:59.843
Training and the real thing are different.

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:01.778
Shohei is doing his best,

00:19:01.845 --> 00:19:05.015
but he doesn't have 52 wins
and major race experience.

00:19:05.082 --> 00:19:09.586
I think Ryujiro's experience is essential
to ensure we get results.

00:19:09.653 --> 00:19:11.855
If you decide it's impossible
from the start,

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:14.691
nothing will change, right?

00:19:17.861 --> 00:19:20.697
Please let me and Shohei
take on the challenge.

00:19:20.764 --> 00:19:24.001
Our goal is to win the Arima.

00:19:24.935 --> 00:19:26.536
For that, we need results.

00:19:26.603 --> 00:19:28.505
The Arima is a race you can only enter

00:19:28.572 --> 00:19:31.041
after achieving results
and gaining recognition in Japan.

00:19:31.108 --> 00:19:32.309
I agree with you.

00:19:32.376 --> 00:19:34.544
We have a race coming up in December.

00:19:38.682 --> 00:19:41.785
We can give up on the next race.

00:19:42.586 --> 00:19:47.357
If we do that, we'll never
be able to compete in the Arima.

00:19:47.424 --> 00:19:48.458
No, not just compete.

00:19:49.826 --> 00:19:51.061
We'll win it.

00:19:51.795 --> 00:19:53.797
-Koichi…
-Please.

00:19:53.864 --> 00:19:55.899
I only have Family.

00:19:56.933 --> 00:19:58.001
Please.

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:07.644
That's right.

00:20:09.079 --> 00:20:10.947
Koichi only has Family.

00:20:11.515 --> 00:20:12.716
But I…

00:20:14.451 --> 00:20:15.852
can ride other horses.

00:20:16.453 --> 00:20:18.388
-Ryujiro!
-Wait, Ryujiro!

00:20:24.127 --> 00:20:25.696
You want to win the Arima.

00:20:26.296 --> 00:20:28.665
You want to fulfill
the late president's wishes.

00:20:30.133 --> 00:20:32.002
Everyone feels the same.

00:20:32.703 --> 00:20:33.804
But…

00:20:34.671 --> 00:20:36.940
If Koichi's plan is the only option,

00:20:37.507 --> 00:20:38.709
then it's not only Ryujiro,

00:20:40.277 --> 00:20:42.412
but me you don't need either.

00:20:44.381 --> 00:20:45.615
Sorry, Mr. Kurisu.

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:48.518
This is as far as we go.

00:20:52.723 --> 00:20:54.524
We need to find a new trainer.

00:20:54.591 --> 00:20:56.760
It's not as easy as you think.

00:20:57.561 --> 00:21:00.297
Let's go back. Let's apologize and--

00:21:00.364 --> 00:21:01.732
I can't.

00:21:01.798 --> 00:21:04.868
Mr. Hironaka now has a high chance
of becoming a leading trainer.

00:21:04.935 --> 00:21:06.536
He will be focusing on that.

00:21:07.204 --> 00:21:10.107
He's cutting us because he can't
afford to keep a horse that can't win--

00:21:10.173 --> 00:21:11.808
Mr. Hironaka is not like that!

00:21:11.875 --> 00:21:14.778
-I'm an inheritance-only owner.
-Positions don't matter!

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:20.984
There's not a single trainer
who will listen

00:21:21.051 --> 00:21:23.487
to what you have to say unconditionally.

00:21:25.288 --> 00:21:29.192
Even the President had times
when no one paid any attention to him.

00:21:29.259 --> 00:21:33.864
However, his strength was his ability
to continue to believe in people.

00:21:38.602 --> 00:21:39.803
I understand.

00:21:42.072 --> 00:21:44.007
You can also quit, Mr. Kurisu.

00:21:45.575 --> 00:21:47.677
I'll think about the rest on my own.

00:21:49.913 --> 00:21:51.047
Are you serious?

00:21:51.581 --> 00:21:52.416
Koichi.

00:21:53.049 --> 00:21:54.050
Koichi!

00:22:14.304 --> 00:22:15.605
Are you going to change jockeys?

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:18.041
I don't know.

00:22:18.108 --> 00:22:20.143
Even Mr. Hironaka might get changed.

00:22:24.147 --> 00:22:26.850
It's not that we don't believe in Shohei.

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:28.718
I want you to understand that.

00:22:30.387 --> 00:22:31.421
I understand.

00:22:31.488 --> 00:22:33.557
Family is special.

00:22:37.294 --> 00:22:40.597
I'm really grateful that he was chosen.

00:22:41.465 --> 00:22:42.632
But…

00:22:44.868 --> 00:22:47.337
Shohei replacing Ryujiro…

00:22:51.641 --> 00:22:53.043
If the President were here,

00:22:54.311 --> 00:22:56.146
I wonder what he would have said.

00:22:56.213 --> 00:22:57.614
Avoid?

00:22:58.114 --> 00:23:00.317
You're going to avoid the next race?

00:23:00.383 --> 00:23:03.420
The next one, or rather,
all of them for the time being.

00:23:03.487 --> 00:23:04.221
What?

00:23:04.287 --> 00:23:06.556
Just ask him.

00:23:06.623 --> 00:23:10.026
What's the meaning of this, Mr. Hironaka?

00:23:11.228 --> 00:23:12.662
Why me?

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:14.598
To win.

00:23:15.699 --> 00:23:18.268
Changing jockeys is common.

00:23:18.969 --> 00:23:22.272
But Ryujiro is the one
who made Hope stronger.

00:23:22.873 --> 00:23:24.007
Thanks to him--

00:23:24.074 --> 00:23:25.942
How long are you going
to keep being just a fan?

00:23:30.747 --> 00:23:32.048
Hope is Hope.

00:23:32.549 --> 00:23:33.850
Family is Family.

00:23:35.185 --> 00:23:38.788
You are none other
than Jockey Shohei Nozaki.

00:23:42.392 --> 00:23:45.362
Shohei will be bringing Koichi.

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:47.564
Please.

00:23:48.098 --> 00:23:50.066
Please listen to him one more time.

00:23:50.834 --> 00:23:52.903
I don't understand.

00:23:52.969 --> 00:23:55.405
There were some selfish horse owners,

00:23:55.472 --> 00:23:59.509
and some, I wondered if they had
any love for their horses, but…

00:24:00.343 --> 00:24:01.778
Koichi is neither.

00:24:02.646 --> 00:24:04.114
That's why he's difficult.

00:24:04.781 --> 00:24:07.150
I wonder if it's a generational gap.

00:24:07.717 --> 00:24:10.120
-Sorry, I kept you waiting.
-Hi!

00:24:11.187 --> 00:24:13.256
Hello there.

00:24:14.324 --> 00:24:15.759
My name is Shiina.

00:24:16.326 --> 00:24:17.627
Are you really sure?

00:24:17.694 --> 00:24:19.763
I'll definitely make you ride it.

00:24:19.829 --> 00:24:21.197
Yes. Thank you very much.

00:24:21.264 --> 00:24:24.367
Okay. It's a promise, then.

00:24:24.434 --> 00:24:26.036
Go to the toilet quickly.

00:24:26.102 --> 00:24:28.371
Yeah. Well, then…

00:24:29.873 --> 00:24:31.241
Off I go!

00:24:34.778 --> 00:24:36.212
What is this about?

00:24:37.347 --> 00:24:38.748
He said, "Let's drink."

00:24:40.183 --> 00:24:42.218
That’s enough. Let's go.

00:24:42.285 --> 00:24:43.653
Mr. Kurisu is waiting.

00:24:48.558 --> 00:24:51.695
Honestly, I don't think
anyone is at fault.

00:24:52.762 --> 00:24:54.431
Mr. Hironaka, and Mr. Kurisu.

00:24:54.497 --> 00:24:58.368
Asking me to ride all of a sudden
puts me in a bind too.

00:25:01.304 --> 00:25:03.039
"No one's at fault.", "A bind."

00:25:03.106 --> 00:25:05.275
I can't be so carefree.

00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:09.145
After becoming a horse owner…

00:25:11.147 --> 00:25:13.717
Do you have any idea
how much pressure I feel?

00:25:16.419 --> 00:25:17.921
It's not just a dream.

00:25:18.622 --> 00:25:22.859
It's not only my father,
I'm also carrying my mother's hopes.

00:25:25.095 --> 00:25:27.597
That's what it means to make Family win.

00:25:28.231 --> 00:25:30.066
That's why I became a horse owner.

00:25:34.938 --> 00:25:36.773
Do you understand…

00:25:38.942 --> 00:25:40.143
how I feel?

00:25:41.578 --> 00:25:42.679
Don't be so selfish.

00:25:43.246 --> 00:25:44.614
It's the same for everyone.

00:25:45.515 --> 00:25:48.952
I'm carrying the Nozaki name.
Everyone is carrying something.

00:25:51.921 --> 00:25:53.223
Definitely…

00:25:53.289 --> 00:25:54.491
Definitely ride it!

00:25:54.557 --> 00:25:55.759
-Okay.
-Okay?

00:25:56.259 --> 00:25:57.861
-Let's call a taxi.
-Excuse me!

00:25:57.927 --> 00:25:59.929
You're involved in horse racing, right?

00:25:59.996 --> 00:26:02.465
What was it called?
That family restaurant sounding…

00:26:02.532 --> 00:26:04.000
-Oh, Royal Family!
-Yes! Royal!

00:26:04.934 --> 00:26:06.603
All-you-can-drink, please!

00:26:07.103 --> 00:26:10.907
It's great being a horse owner.
Do you go out drinking every night?

00:26:11.574 --> 00:26:12.542
Koichi!

00:26:17.347 --> 00:26:19.149
Don't get too cocky!

00:26:19.215 --> 00:26:21.151
It's probably your parents' money, right?

00:26:21.217 --> 00:26:23.853
At least make a horse that can win!

00:26:24.387 --> 00:26:26.489
It's his father's fault.

00:26:26.556 --> 00:26:29.793
He can't win because his father
did bad things when he was alive.

00:26:29.859 --> 00:26:30.760
You're right!

00:26:31.361 --> 00:26:33.129
You've got it tough as his successor.

00:26:39.069 --> 00:26:41.471
The person you have dialed…

00:26:42.038 --> 00:26:43.139
I'm going to go.

00:26:43.206 --> 00:26:45.675
-Mr. Hironaka…
-Maybe this is for the best.

00:26:45.742 --> 00:26:48.978
Rather than saying the wrong thing
and falling into self-loathing,

00:26:49.612 --> 00:26:51.581
it's best if we don't meet at all.

00:26:53.016 --> 00:26:53.883
See you.

00:27:09.265 --> 00:27:10.400
Hello?

00:27:10.467 --> 00:27:14.804
I'm Odaka from the Public Safety Division
of the Minami-Azabu Police Station.

00:27:15.739 --> 00:27:16.639
Yes?

00:27:16.706 --> 00:27:20.243
We have Koichi Nakajo here with us.

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:21.511
What?

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:26.483
Apparently, he got into a fight
while drunk.

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:30.320
Now, he's sobered up
and is feeling quite remorseful.

00:27:31.454 --> 00:27:32.489
Come in.

00:27:35.058 --> 00:27:37.961
Someone is also coming
to pick up his friend.

00:27:38.795 --> 00:27:41.831
It was the other person who started it.

00:27:42.499 --> 00:27:46.136
They're reflecting on the incident
and said that they won't make it an issue,

00:27:46.703 --> 00:27:48.972
so you can leave for today.

00:27:52.509 --> 00:27:53.810
Please excuse me.

00:27:55.678 --> 00:27:56.713
Sorry for this.

00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:58.481
I apologize for the inconvenience.

00:28:08.258 --> 00:28:10.293
-We'll go ahead.
-Take care.

00:28:15.064 --> 00:28:17.834
Koichi! See you again at the racetrack!

00:28:19.169 --> 00:28:21.171
-Bye!
-Take care.

00:28:23.006 --> 00:28:24.407
Good night!

00:28:31.648 --> 00:28:33.049
Thank you very much.

00:28:38.021 --> 00:28:39.589
What happened to Shohei?

00:28:44.527 --> 00:28:45.528
You were together.

00:28:47.564 --> 00:28:53.736
Before meeting you, he called me
and said he would bring you over.

00:28:55.004 --> 00:28:56.639
Why is he not here?

00:28:59.642 --> 00:29:03.213
He went home first.

00:29:05.181 --> 00:29:06.783
I wouldn't move, so…

00:29:09.652 --> 00:29:11.120
You're careless.

00:29:12.255 --> 00:29:13.723
You lack awareness.

00:29:14.324 --> 00:29:15.925
That's not adult behavior.

00:29:24.434 --> 00:29:26.536
Let's find a new stable for Family.

00:29:27.737 --> 00:29:29.839
We can no longer rely on Mr. Hironaka.

00:29:33.943 --> 00:29:36.045
SANNO FAMILY GRAVE

00:29:40.483 --> 00:29:42.252
It won't be until I hand them over to you.

00:29:42.318 --> 00:29:43.920
But until that horse…

00:29:46.089 --> 00:29:47.423
finishes first.

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:53.363
Family will get us what we are missing.

00:29:53.429 --> 00:29:54.464
The Arima Kinen.

00:30:00.436 --> 00:30:03.439
So if you start to waver…

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:12.181
Damn it.

00:30:21.925 --> 00:30:25.261
-I'm sorry about the other day.
-It's okay.

00:30:25.929 --> 00:30:28.531
Please take this, it's not much.

00:30:28.598 --> 00:30:31.067
-Thank you.
-I hope it's not a problem.

00:30:31.134 --> 00:30:35.405
HIRONAKA STABLE

00:30:43.379 --> 00:30:45.114
Sorry about the other day.

00:30:45.715 --> 00:30:48.451
-It seems Koichi got you involved--
-You've got it wrong.

00:30:50.153 --> 00:30:52.822
I'm really sorry!

00:30:52.889 --> 00:30:53.990
What?

00:31:03.866 --> 00:31:05.168
I was waiting for you.

00:31:08.738 --> 00:31:11.541
The President's favorite place
was a tempura restaurant,

00:31:11.607 --> 00:31:14.777
and mine is this set meal restaurant.

00:31:16.512 --> 00:31:17.547
Please sit here.

00:31:18.114 --> 00:31:19.415
Thank you very much.

00:31:19.482 --> 00:31:21.751
-Excuse me. Beer, please.
-Okay.

00:31:24.354 --> 00:31:26.656
-Thank you for waiting.
-Thank you.

00:31:27.423 --> 00:31:28.925
Oh, thank you.

00:31:31.094 --> 00:31:34.030
I heard what happened
that night from Shohei.

00:31:36.466 --> 00:31:39.902
He can't win because his father
did bad things when he was alive.

00:31:39.969 --> 00:31:41.104
You're right!

00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:43.039
You've got it tough as his successor.

00:31:44.674 --> 00:31:45.875
What the hell do you know?

00:31:47.744 --> 00:31:49.379
-Everybody's doing it to win.
-Shohei.

00:31:49.445 --> 00:31:50.880
Everybody's struggling to win!

00:31:50.947 --> 00:31:53.983
-Do you want to go? Hey!
-Don't touch him!

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:56.152
A jockey being here would be bad. Go!

00:31:56.219 --> 00:31:57.787
-Hey! Wait!
-Hey!

00:31:57.854 --> 00:32:00.590
-Go! Hurry!
-What's with you? Don't touch me!

00:32:00.656 --> 00:32:03.426
-Don't get in the way!
-What the hell?

00:32:05.261 --> 00:32:10.066
I'm sorry I said such terrible things
without knowing the truth.

00:32:10.133 --> 00:32:11.167
No, it's okay.

00:32:11.968 --> 00:32:13.736
I brought that situation on.

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:15.538
No…

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:21.244
-Have you decided what to order?
-Oh, the daily special.

00:32:22.478 --> 00:32:25.548
What about you?
Everything's delicious, by the way.

00:32:26.883 --> 00:32:29.952
Then, the daily special for me too.

00:32:30.019 --> 00:32:32.722
-Two daily specials.
-How about the rice?

00:32:32.789 --> 00:32:34.424
-Large serving, please.
-Okay.

00:32:45.268 --> 00:32:49.238
There is something
I need to apologize to you for.

00:32:51.007 --> 00:32:55.378
Since I started working as your secretary,
I have continuously thought,

00:32:56.813 --> 00:32:59.549
"What would the President do?"

00:33:01.584 --> 00:33:05.955
But… that means that
I haven't been seeing you as you.

00:33:06.856 --> 00:33:08.524
I'm a failure as a secretary.

00:33:13.796 --> 00:33:14.997
Actually…

00:33:18.267 --> 00:33:20.103
Before he died,

00:33:22.738 --> 00:33:24.340
he told me something.

00:33:25.074 --> 00:33:26.109
Koichi.

00:33:26.876 --> 00:33:28.177
From now on,

00:33:29.712 --> 00:33:34.851
many people will try to impose
what appear to be horse racing rules.

00:33:36.953 --> 00:33:38.387
But, you…

00:33:39.188 --> 00:33:41.157
You are not from that world.

00:33:43.025 --> 00:33:44.327
You're…

00:33:45.194 --> 00:33:47.396
just a man who loves horses.

00:33:48.564 --> 00:33:51.134
So if you start to waver…

00:33:52.902 --> 00:33:54.504
prioritize only the horse

00:33:55.505 --> 00:33:58.040
and what you believe in.

00:34:03.813 --> 00:34:04.814
Okay.

00:34:05.882 --> 00:34:09.952
I did as I was told,
I only thought about Family.

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:13.723
I thought that was
the only thing I could rely on.

00:34:15.324 --> 00:34:18.728
But Family needs a team,

00:34:20.263 --> 00:34:22.231
and I need you all.

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:26.269
I didn't know anything.

00:34:28.137 --> 00:34:32.375
I just wanted you all to think
that everything's all right,

00:34:33.676 --> 00:34:35.444
that I could handle things.

00:34:37.713 --> 00:34:41.817
I'm sorry for making you bear
all of this alone.

00:34:42.885 --> 00:34:44.020
No, it's okay.

00:34:44.687 --> 00:34:46.088
Thank you for waiting.

00:34:48.491 --> 00:34:49.559
Thank you.

00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:52.295
Let's eat before it gets cold.

00:34:55.798 --> 00:34:57.333
I always eat dinner alone.

00:34:59.702 --> 00:35:01.337
"It's delicious," or…

00:35:02.505 --> 00:35:04.040
"I'm happy."

00:35:06.209 --> 00:35:11.480
I'm not good
at putting my feelings into words.

00:35:15.184 --> 00:35:17.820
I don't know
if I can convey this properly.

00:35:23.893 --> 00:35:25.494
Winning the Arima Kinen.

00:35:25.561 --> 00:35:27.496
This dream…

00:35:30.032 --> 00:35:33.102
is also the dream of everyone
who fought alongside my father.

00:35:35.471 --> 00:35:36.672
Mr. Kurisu.

00:35:38.074 --> 00:35:40.076
Would you let me join in on that dream?

00:35:42.411 --> 00:35:45.948
I want to make it happen,
together with you all.

00:35:47.383 --> 00:35:49.418
Would you fight with me again?

00:35:53.422 --> 00:35:55.558
Let's win the Arima Kinen together.

00:35:57.393 --> 00:35:58.728
I beg of you.

00:36:12.308 --> 00:36:13.676
Understood.

00:36:17.513 --> 00:36:19.115
Thank you very much.

00:36:19.181 --> 00:36:20.249
Yes.

00:36:26.188 --> 00:36:27.657
Just one thing.

00:36:29.892 --> 00:36:32.328
Don't you ever betray me.

00:36:34.664 --> 00:36:35.965
Ever.

00:36:39.302 --> 00:36:40.603
I understand.

00:36:42.972 --> 00:36:45.441
I won't ever betray you.

00:36:47.576 --> 00:36:48.544
Ever.

00:36:53.015 --> 00:36:54.083
Let's eat.

00:36:54.984 --> 00:36:55.985
Yes.

00:36:58.020 --> 00:36:59.422
Thank you for the meal.

00:36:59.488 --> 00:37:00.756
Thank you for the meal.

00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:16.172
-It's delicious.
-Yes.

00:37:18.774 --> 00:37:20.276
I'm very sorry.

00:37:22.478 --> 00:37:26.916
Please, could you listen
to Koichi's thoughts one more time?

00:37:36.392 --> 00:37:39.929
My plan was based on the idea

00:37:41.497 --> 00:37:44.133
of winning the Arima
two years from now, not next year.

00:37:45.201 --> 00:37:48.304
I believe Family is a late bloomer.

00:37:48.371 --> 00:37:51.173
So, we don't rush. Let's take our time.

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:54.443
I want to create a plan
that will ensure Family wins the Arima.

00:37:57.246 --> 00:37:59.515
Because I'm an inheritance-only
horse owner,

00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:03.786
and Family is the only one I have.

00:38:03.853 --> 00:38:07.156
In a few years, Family will also retire.

00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:11.160
Even after that,
it is my responsibility and goal

00:38:11.227 --> 00:38:13.562
to continue supporting Family.

00:38:16.465 --> 00:38:17.500
But…

00:38:19.502 --> 00:38:21.103
I don't have the financial means.

00:38:21.737 --> 00:38:25.608
The only thing I can do is get Family
to produce results in the big races.

00:38:25.674 --> 00:38:29.378
Making sure he can earn enough
to feed himself until he dies

00:38:30.813 --> 00:38:34.583
is just as important
as winning the Arima Kinen.

00:38:36.652 --> 00:38:37.953
So I…

00:38:40.389 --> 00:38:42.224
want to win no matter what.

00:38:43.092 --> 00:38:45.861
It was a plan that came
from thinking about Family.

00:38:46.996 --> 00:38:50.566
But I'm really sorry that…

00:38:53.135 --> 00:38:54.537
I couldn't express it well.

00:38:54.603 --> 00:38:55.771
No.

00:38:55.838 --> 00:38:59.141
Of course, we need to keep winning,

00:38:59.208 --> 00:39:02.545
but that is just a means to win the Arima.

00:39:03.646 --> 00:39:05.581
As for Shohei's appointment,

00:39:05.648 --> 00:39:09.285
Koichi nominated him with the expectation
that he'd grow in the next two years.

00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:12.021
Right now,

00:39:13.122 --> 00:39:16.225
at this very moment,
Ryujiro is the one who can win.

00:39:17.593 --> 00:39:19.328
However, I think that in two years,

00:39:19.395 --> 00:39:22.998
Shohei and Ryujiro
will be competing for the top spot.

00:39:34.743 --> 00:39:35.878
I understand.

00:39:42.618 --> 00:39:43.686
I'll go.

00:39:50.659 --> 00:39:52.928
In two years, huh?

00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:58.634
Interesting.

00:39:59.535 --> 00:40:02.271
Then there's a lot we can do.

00:40:02.838 --> 00:40:05.941
I was being stubborn.

00:40:06.008 --> 00:40:09.445
All I could think about was getting
to the Arima as soon as possible.

00:40:09.512 --> 00:40:10.846
I'm really sorry.

00:40:10.913 --> 00:40:12.214
No.

00:40:12.281 --> 00:40:16.552
Don't mind Ryujiro.
That's the kind of job a jockey is.

00:40:17.119 --> 00:40:21.123
We will proceed
with training based on your plan.

00:40:22.157 --> 00:40:25.628
Of course, this is based on the assumption
that Shohei will be appointed.

00:40:25.694 --> 00:40:28.664
But there are many weak spots.

00:40:29.832 --> 00:40:30.799
Koichi.

00:40:31.834 --> 00:40:35.905
Would you like to help us redesign
the two-year road map?

00:40:40.342 --> 00:40:41.577
Thank you.

00:40:42.478 --> 00:40:43.979
You didn't have to come.

00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:47.616
I was the one
who got you involved in the first place.

00:40:49.952 --> 00:40:51.754
Thank you so much

00:40:53.322 --> 00:40:54.823
for running with us this far.

00:40:59.161 --> 00:41:00.796
The race is just a moment.

00:41:01.363 --> 00:41:02.698
I think jockeys

00:41:03.966 --> 00:41:10.072
carry those moments with them
for the rest of their lives.

00:41:12.174 --> 00:41:13.175
There are…

00:41:15.110 --> 00:41:18.013
countless moments living inside me.

00:41:20.115 --> 00:41:23.519
I'll carry them until I retire,
and I think that’s enough.

00:41:49.545 --> 00:41:52.414
It's a problem, right? What I did.

00:41:52.481 --> 00:41:54.283
If I had been there,

00:41:55.217 --> 00:41:56.885
I would have done the same thing.

00:41:58.587 --> 00:42:02.291
It was a problem,
but we won't make it a problem.

00:42:19.541 --> 00:42:23.145
Shohei will be Family's main jockey
from the next race.

00:42:25.848 --> 00:42:27.416
Believe in him.

00:42:27.483 --> 00:42:30.019
If you don't believe in him, who will?

00:42:33.255 --> 00:42:35.591
ROYAL HOPE

00:42:37.559 --> 00:42:38.794
The new year arrived,

00:42:38.861 --> 00:42:43.465
Royal Family made a new start
with Shohei Nozaki.

00:42:55.544 --> 00:42:58.647
Stop!

00:42:59.248 --> 00:43:00.983
Race Ten, mount up.

00:43:18.967 --> 00:43:23.105
Number 11, Royal Family, is going wide,
and he finishes in first place!

00:43:23.172 --> 00:43:25.407
-Yes!
-All right!

00:43:26.008 --> 00:43:27.710
The result was first place.

00:43:28.277 --> 00:43:31.113
From that day onwards,
Family won three consecutive races

00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:33.515
and was thrust into the spotlight.

00:43:34.149 --> 00:43:38.087
However, there was something
that stood in their way.

00:43:38.654 --> 00:43:40.889
He's fast! He's strong!
A four, five-length lead!

00:43:40.956 --> 00:43:44.259
Number 11, So Perfect,
finishes in first place!

00:43:44.893 --> 00:43:48.130
-Jockey Ryujiro Saki is looking relaxed…
-What's with that horse?

00:43:48.197 --> 00:43:49.898
What a monster.

00:43:53.268 --> 00:43:57.473
SO PERFECT

00:44:00.976 --> 00:44:03.545
I wish you could have played
a little longer.

00:44:04.113 --> 00:44:07.616
-That's the result of playing.
-You're the best.

00:44:08.250 --> 00:44:09.551
A picture, please.

00:44:12.121 --> 00:44:13.188
Congratulations.

00:44:13.255 --> 00:44:16.191
That horse still has a long way to go.
It will be from here on out.

00:44:16.258 --> 00:44:17.593
-It's amazing!
-Do your best!

00:44:17.659 --> 00:44:20.195
-I heard you bought it for 39 million?
-You should come by.

00:44:20.262 --> 00:44:22.498
-I'd love to.
-Thank you.

00:44:28.771 --> 00:44:31.807
That horse! The 39 million from that time!

00:44:31.874 --> 00:44:33.242
So Perfect!

00:44:33.809 --> 00:44:37.045
I was truly lucky.

00:44:37.112 --> 00:44:41.750
Thanks to you cutting off Ryujiro,
I suddenly have the best duo!

00:44:43.018 --> 00:44:47.523
I'm sorry, I know you had
your eye on this horse too.

00:44:48.223 --> 00:44:49.391
Not at all.

00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:53.295
Family is all I need.

00:44:55.364 --> 00:44:59.368
I don't care about generations
or being the strongest.

00:45:01.036 --> 00:45:03.739
Family and I will win the Arima.
That's all I need.

00:45:09.511 --> 00:45:10.846
There's room, right?

00:45:12.281 --> 00:45:13.682
For a horse owner like me?

00:45:23.992 --> 00:45:26.428
-Royal Family's jockey is down!
-Shohei!

00:45:26.495 --> 00:45:28.864
He's in pain. He should get looked at.

00:45:28.931 --> 00:45:30.799
We'll change jockeys.

00:45:30.866 --> 00:45:33.936
Maybe we should
think about retiring Family.

00:45:34.002 --> 00:45:35.037
