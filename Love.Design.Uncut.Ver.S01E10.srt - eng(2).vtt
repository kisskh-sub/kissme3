00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.160
You two must get married first.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.280
Get married?

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.920
Go back to where you first met. Start from there.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.000
There’s no ring, sis.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.320
I’ve always known you were trying to buy me a ring.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.120
– I wanted a simple platinum ring.
– Just that already makes me so happy.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.880
Then… can I propose to you with a drawing?

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.560
Will you marry me?

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.600
My love.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.880
Thank you.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.760
For creating this love with me.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.560
Babe.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:57.640
Yess?

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.760
Don’t forget my drawing tools, okay?

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.520
And also…

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.040
The anniversary card you wrote me.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.600
Keep it safe… I don’t want it to get lost.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.520
I know. I already put it in a box.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.720
And labeled it.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.240
– “Tertis’ treasure." Will never lose
– Ohh…

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.480
Then I should put you in the box too.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.440
– You’re my treasure, after all.
– Oh wow…

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.400
Afraid I’ll disappear?

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.520
Mhm…

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.720
Where could I ever go?

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.280
It took us so long to finally meet.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.120
Destiny brought us together.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.320
I really believe that.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.400
Otherwise… we would’ve never ended up loving each other like this.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.200
[Back then…]

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.160
[I never believed in that stuff.]
Yes.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.200
I just got home.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.640
I’ll revise it and send it right away.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.160
[The only thing I believed in…]
Okay.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.880
[…was hard work.]

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.520
[For the people I love.]

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.280
Yes, Mom.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.760
I’ll transfer the money right away.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.200
Don’t worry about the money.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.280
I’ll take care of it.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.000
It’s okay, it’s okay.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.400
After we hang up, I'll go take some medicine, okay?

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.000
Okay, goodbye.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.280
[But who would’ve thought…]

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.080
[…that an illness would lead me to…]

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.920
[…my true love.]

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.840
I moved the deadline forward. Can you finish it tonight?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.600
Yes, I can.
I had a small issue last night.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.840
I’ll send it right away. I’m sorry.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.840
When you get home, you need to take your medicine, okay?

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.280
And drink lots of water.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.520
The medicine will help you fight that mean fever.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.840
And once you get better—

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.040
You have to eat healthy food too, okay?

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.720
Understand?

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.280
So your body gets stronger.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.920
And I’ve got candy for my little warrior.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.600
Ms. Waleerat?

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.920
Please come inside.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.560
I have a treat for you, sweetheart.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.080
– Thank you.
– Thank youuu.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.760
So cute… kids are adorable.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.480
Your initial blood test today looks normal.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.360
Only your electrolytes are slightly low.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.520
As for the dizziness—

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.840
It’s likely due to what you described:

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.280
working too hard, lack of rest, and not drinking enough water.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.600
For now, there’s nothing serious to worry about.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.880
But I recommend drinking more water.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.600
And getting enough rest.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.960
I’ll prescribe some medicine for your symptoms.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.720
And I’ll give you electrolytes as well.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.280
Okay, doctor.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.160
And most importantly—

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.360
Try to adjust your habits.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.720
– Yes, doctor. Thank you.
– Sure.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:12.560
[MUSIC]

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.810
[MUSIC] You’re my midnight sun in the sky

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.010
No matter how long, you’re glowing through the night

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:32.130
Warm like daylight soft and kind, never burning too bright

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.410
Holding you this close, I never need anything more

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.210
Who would believe that a midnight sun so bright

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.290
Could turn both night and day into the same warm light

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.460
Staying right here by my side

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.340
Chasing all the darkness deep inside

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.620
Would you be my midnight sun forever...

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.760
In my life? [MUSIC]

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:14.830
Are you looking for something?

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:16.430
No, not at all

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.910
Then please have a seat while we prepare your medication.

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:20.270
Okay.

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.300
Fabulous.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:55.780
Break, break, break!

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.860
Hey, what time is the call tomorrow?

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:01.740
Standby at 9:30.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:05.420
The performance starts at 11, but we need to be there at 7.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:06.940
To allow time for makeup and hair.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.500
Damn, 7 a.m.?

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.820
– That’s so early.
– I’m gonna die.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.420
Don’t complain.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:14.980
Jobs are already hard to come by.

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.420
Oh, and next week—

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.820
Don’t forget to get the HPV shot I told you guys about.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.260
Okayyy.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:25.780
Do I really have to?

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:29.820
I mean, it’s not like I’m into girls—you know that.

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.500
That has nothing to do with it.

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:34.620
HPV doesn’t discriminate by gender, you know.

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.340
Male–female, female–female, male–male…

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.020
Anyone can catch it — and more importantly,

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:41.460
this virus…

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.460
can lead to cancer if you get infected.

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:44.980
Prevention is better than cure.

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.100
The sooner you get vaccinated, the better.

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:48.260
It’s only three shots.

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:49.420
Piece of cake.

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:50.540
Okay.

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:51.700
Yes ma’am, got it.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.140
Sure.

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:55.900
Tertis dear,

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.020
We need to cancel tomorrow’s event for now.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:58.940
Shit.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:01.300
What’s going on?

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:03.700
They just texted to cancel tomorrow’s job.

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.300
Why are they telling us now?

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.340
So we wasted the studio fee for nothing.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:09.460
Should we look for another gig?

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:18.100
Tis.

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:19.420
Did she reply yet?

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:21.060
Ugh…

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:22.460
She hasn’t even read it.

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:23.660
God…

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:25.860
Come on, girls.

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:28.220
Just think of it as not having to wake up early tomorrow.

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.300
If you can stay this positive…

00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:34.380
You’ll end up sleeping in every day at this rate.

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:38.740
Ugh… can’t find a full-time job.

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:40.260
My side gigs keep getting canceled.

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.300
Can I just wake up rich tomorrow?

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:44.180
In that case—

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:48.180
Go find a rich guy tonight.

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:51.260
Then you’ll wake up rich tomorrow, babe.

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:53.460
Are you insane?

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:54.980
You know I hate that.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.100
I know.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.980
Just in case you change your mind. Miss “True Love Believer”—

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:03.060
might switch teams once her bank account hits zero.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.340
If I’m broke, I’ll just find work. There’s plenty out there.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:10.540
Ugh, and what about love? You gonna make a move or not?

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:13.020
No thanks.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.340
If it’s meant to come, it’ll come.

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:19.500
So you’re waiting for destiny to deliver true love to you or what, Tis?

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:20.860
Maybe it’s somewhere out there.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:22.460
Or maybe…

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.500
My soulmate hasn’t even been born yet.

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:17.620
Girls!

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:20.300
Try this app. Seriously.

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:22.380
Let me tell you something.

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:25.020
I met my current boyfriend from this app.

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:27.620
Oh my god, no.

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.020
Then that’s not destiny anymore!
Oh come on!

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:31.820
You’ll never know if you don’t try.

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:34.020
Destiny might show up in a new form, you know.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.620
Like… AI matching and stuff, babe.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:36.500
Trust me.

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:38.460
Yeah.

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:40.140
Just take a look first. Look—

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.380
Look at these guys, so handsome.

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:44.380
This one—

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.700
A sweet, sincere cutie.
What—

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:50.020
And this one— abs for days!
Oh my god—

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:51.740
Hot.

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:53.100
I told you guys, that’s not my type!

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:55.100
Ughhh
Girls, he’s TOO much.

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:59.020
Who would even know?
Look, look! This one! Another one! Here—this one!

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.580
Here you go.

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:06.940
Thank you.

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:19.100
– How are you, gorgeous?
– I’m good.

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:20.180
What would you like to order?

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.260
Matcha latte, no syrup please.

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:25.500
– Okay, matcha latte, no sweet.
– Mm.

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:26.580
Coming right up.

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:29.580
[I have a café I go to all the time.]

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:31.900
[But we never once noticed each other.]

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:38.140
Okay.

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:39.700
Hello? I’m here.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:41.180
- Where are you?
- So for this.

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.620
How would you like the background to be?

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:44.780
- Like how?
- Thought you said you were almost here.

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:46.940
- Uh…
- When will you actually get here?

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.060
- Could it look like a brick texture?

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:51.420
- Sure, and—
- Are you on your way or not?

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.460
What kind of texture do you want?

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.860
See? You’re late.

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:59.140
Thirty minutes isn’t enough for anything. Hurry up!

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.780
- Okay…
[We used to be so close…]

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:04.940
- Hey, hurry!
[Yet we never truly met.]

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:11.260
Oh—

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:12.900
I almost forgot.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.260
Come here, take it here. This angle is perfect.

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:22.820
One, two, snap!

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.860
Damn, what a pity.

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:29.700
Someone in the back got in the shot.

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:34.020
Want another one? I’ll take it for you.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:37.820
[It felt like… it just wasn’t the time yet.]

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:42.020
[Not the moment that destiny had written for us.]

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.740
Back then, I almost gave up, you know?

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.180
I thought I’d never see you again.

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.300
But we eventually did, right?

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:56.140
You should thank me, you know.

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:58.420
For downloading that app.

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:01.500
I don’t usually use apps like that.

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:06.220
Then why did you suddenly try it?

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:10.580
I don’t know.

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:13.860
Something just nudged me, I guess.

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:17.820
But it brought us together, didn’t it?

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:26.980
Yeah.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:28.540
I never asked you this.

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:30.260
How many people did you chat with before me?

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:33.220
I already told you.

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:36.660
You were the first person I ever tapped the heart for.

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:39.660
And the only one I talked to.

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:46.420
My first ever, you know?

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:51.340
Which one?

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:53.300
Tell us.

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:54.620
Which one? Come on.

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:58.620
Here you go.

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:04.220
Excuse me.

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:06.260
Today…

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:09.260
The singer who plays guitar…

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.580
The one who sings really well… isn’t coming?

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:12.900
Oh—

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:14.540
She’s off today.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:16.980
Sorry for the inconvenience.

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:20.700
Thank you.

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:28.380
Hey, I’m going to the bathroom.

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:30.300
– I’ll go too.
– Let's go.

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:32.660
Coming?

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:34.980
Hey, I wanna go too!

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:36.300
– What?
– Bathroom run.

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:37.980
Hurry back.

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.500
Try this app.

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.060
My current boyfriend—

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.260
I met him from this app.

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:58.380
Destiny might come in a new form, you know.

00:14:58.620 --> 00:14:59.900
AI might match you two.

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:00.860
Trust me.

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:25.380
She’s a singer…

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:29.020
And an architect too?

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:36.620
Hi! I’m Tertis

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:40.900
Hi! I’m Vee.

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:42.540
Whoa—

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:44.780
She replied so fast… like she's guarding the chat.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:48.220
Is she a flirt or what?

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:57.700
You’re the one who plays music at the bar—

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:02.100
Right?

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:06.500
[And at that moment, destiny…]

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:09.900
[…opened the path for the two of us to meet.]

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:14.900
You’ve been working so much.

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:17.100
Take a break and think of me too, okay?

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:19.220
I don't need a break to miss you.

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:24.420
No need for syrup—it's sweet enough already.

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:45.140
Ugh, your chat keeps popping. Go reply!

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:46.500
Sorry—

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:49.620
See?

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:50.900
She’s really head over heel.

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:03.220
Hello, auntie.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:04.620
Oh, hello dear.

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:05.940
Here, let me help you pick this up.

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:07.780
You haven’t come by in a while.

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:10.100
What are you praying for today?

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:11.740
Well…

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.500
I’m not asking for much.

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:18.340
Oh my—praying for love, right?

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:20.980
How did you know?

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:25.780
With that glowing face? What else would it be?

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:27.620
So what are you asking for?

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:29.540
Praying to get married?

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.260
Oh, auntie—

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:34.980
Let us date first. We haven’t even met in person!

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:37.100
Marriage is too fast.

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:38.900
Then go and meet her in person, dear.

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:42.180
Destiny doesn’t come around often, you know.

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:56.180
I’ll ask her out now, okay?

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:05.140
P’Vee, are you free this evening? Would you like to have dinner together?

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:23.420
Yes.

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:24.820
Of course.

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:26.740
Always yes.

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:31.180
Thank you, goddess.

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:33.300
So miraculous.

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.260
Please bless this love of mine to come true.

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:38.100
Amen.

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:01.660
Have you waited long?

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:03.300
P’Vee.

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:09.900
Not long, Tertis.

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:12.020
I just got here.

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:20.180
You’re so cute.

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:23.660
You too.

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:44.980
Thank you for dinner today.

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:48.620
It’s okay, I’m happy to.

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:52.020
Tertis, you know…

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:54.820
I’m really happy.

00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:59.500
Thank you for asking me to meet.

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:02.740
But I didn’t even do anything.

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:07.100
Just the fact that we got to meet…

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:08.540
To talk…

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:10.860
And spend time together…

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:13.540
For me…

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:15.900
That alone is more than enough.

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:28.140
Well then…

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:30.140
I’ll get going then.

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:36.500
Tertis.

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:39.100
Yes?

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:43.420
Um…

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:48.460
Tertis…

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:55.620
Tertis, would you like to be my girlfriend?

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:02.340
Huh?

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:06.380
You don’t have to answer me right away.

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:08.820
I just…

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:14.980
N-no, it’s okay. Don’t worry about it.

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:17.660
I don’t want to go home alone anymore.

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:20.820
Huh?

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:22.500
From now on…

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:27.500
P’Vee, will you send me home every day?

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:45.500
[And in the end, we finally became a couple.]

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:00.700
Here you go.

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:02.220
So, how is it?

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:04.220
Do you really like it that much?

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:05.860
I love it so much.

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:07.580
Then come have it every day.

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:08.940
I’m serious, you know.

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:10.780
Would you like to move in with me?

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:21.260
You mean…

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:23.660
Sleep here with you…

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:25.340
Every day?

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:30.220
No, that’s not what I meant.

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:33.100
I meant… come live here.

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:35.940
Do you even need to ask?

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:37.100
For real?

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:39.180
You’re not lying to me, right, Tis?

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:40.420
Of course.

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:43.380
But…

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:45.500
No matter what happens…

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:47.180
We must never let go of each other.

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:49.420
I won’t.

00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:51.900
– Promise?
– Promise.

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:55.820
[Our love had never once faltered since we got together.]

00:23:57.820 --> 00:23:58.620
Yes.

00:23:58.660 --> 00:23:59.460
Sure.

00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:02.580
Just let me know when you want me to start.

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:05.060
I’ll be working at Jinta Architect.

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:07.900
What if our companies end up competing…

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:09.180
Hmm.

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:11.460
If that really happens…

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:13.100
…then we’d have to break up.

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:15.180
I already sealed it with a kiss.

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:17.660
I’m not breaking up with you, no matter what.

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:23.020
[Who would’ve thought...something we joked about…]

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:24.900
[…would turn into reality.]

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:27.860
[We ended up working at rival companies.]

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:29.380
[And they hated each other.]

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:32.380
We agreed, didn’t we?

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:34.660
That we wouldn’t talk about work details.

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:36.980
Come on—let's go play in the water.

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:51.700
I love you.

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:55.220
I love you too, P’Vee.

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:45.380
[We believed in our love completely.]

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:47.940
[No matter what obstacles came our way.]

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:58.420
[But then, destiny sent us another test.]

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:00.580
[And a big one, too.]

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:05.940
Oh—

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:07.340
Sorry.

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:10.020
– P’Vee?
– Love.

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:11.580
What a coincidence.

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:13.380
How many years has it been since we last met?

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:14.300
Right?

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:16.100
How have you been? Doing well?

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:17.220
I’m doing good.

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:20.020
And you? Still working at the same place?

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:22.020
Yeah, I’m still there.

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:24.580
And you graduated already, right?

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:27.700
I just finished my master’s. I’m job hunting now.

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:30.700
Oh—do you want to work at Mind Space? I can help.

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:34.260
Babe.

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:40.860
Coming.

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:49.900
Not eating?

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:53.100
Isn’t this your favorite?

00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:57.860
Guess it’s not as good as your little “Love,” huh?

00:26:57.980 --> 00:26:58.980
We just know each other.

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:00.660
Know each other—or used to date?

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:02.660
If she’s your ex…

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:05.500
Then it’s more than “just knowing,” isn’t it?

00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:10.220
Tis…

00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:13.940
We broke up years ago.

00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:15.860
And we haven’t talked ever since.

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:18.260
So you admit it now?

00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:21.940
You only tell me because I pushed you?

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:23.500
Why didn’t you tell me from the start—

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:24.820
—that you had a girlfriend before?

00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:26.900
Tis… I’m in my twenties.

00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:28.780
Of course I’ve had relationships.

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:29.900
But I’ve never had one!

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:31.500
Then what do you want me to do?

00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:33.820
You still have to ask? If you can’t figure it out—

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:35.380
—then don’t come cuddling me at night.

00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:37.660
Tis…

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:40.100
Don’t be ridiculous.

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:55.100
Yeah.

00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:56.860
I am being ridiculous.

00:27:57.780 --> 00:27:59.340
So I’ll go be ridiculous somewhere else.

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:01.580
Hey—where are you going?

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:06.140
Don’t follow me.

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:08.420
If you follow me, I’ll be mad.

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:36.060
P’Man.

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:38.020
Did Tertis come here today?

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:39.220
Haven’t seen her.

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:41.260
Thank you.

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:42.140
Mm-hmm.

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:35.060
Last time I came here wishing for love, and it came true.

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:41.180
Please help me find my love again this time.

00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:49.540
Please let me find her… please…

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:02.500
Ouch.

00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:06.500
Tertis!

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:09.820
Miraculous!!

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:15.220
Let me see.

00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:16.620
Where does it hurt?

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:18.020
Let me check.

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:20.460
Why did you throw that at me?!

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:22.420
I told you not to follow me!

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:24.140
Why did you follow me anyway?!

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:26.140
How could I not follow you?

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:28.380
My girlfriend disappeared on me.

00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:30.500
And you—

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:32.500
Why are you here?

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:35.220
I wasn’t planning for you to see me.

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:37.260
I just… followed you secretly.

00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:39.620
Wait—

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:43.780
You’ve been following me this whole time?

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:46.460
Well…

00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:02.020
I wasn’t gonna let you find me that easily.

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:07.860
Tis…

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:10.940
Do you have any idea how worried I was?

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:14.180
Don’t ever do this again, okay?

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:16.740
I’m sorry…

00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:18.940
I’m sorry too.

00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:24.020
For calling you ridiculous earlier.

00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:26.420
I didn’t mean it like that.

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:30.180
Can you forgive me?

00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:34.140
I was being ridiculous too.

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:36.220
I’m sorry…

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:38.980
But do you know how much I love you?

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:41.100
And how worried I was?

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:45.180
[The hardships only made our love stronger.]

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:48.380
[If destiny brought us together—]

00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:50.700
[—then I will never]

00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:52.500
[let this person go.]

00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:14.900
Do you believe me now?

00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:18.140
That destiny really exists?

00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:26.180
I have something to confess.

00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:27.420
Hm?

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:29.460
Actually… I’ve believed in it for a long time.

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:32.140
Otherwise why would I go pray at the shrine?

00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:33.780
Hmph.

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:34.940
Wait—

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:36.820
Did you trick me?

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:41.140
You’re such a little troublemaker, aren’t you?

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:50.340
You know what I think?

00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:51.660
Destiny—

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:54.180
It’s just like when we were—

00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:56.380
—house hunting.

00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:00.780
You never know which house—

00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:01.820
—is meant to be our.

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:04.740
Not until—

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:07.700
You stand in front of it and see it with your own eyes.

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:10.020
That’s when—

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:12.460
You realize this house—

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:13.860
—is the one for us.

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:22.340
Thank you, destiny…

00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:25.620
…for bringing us together.

00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:02.740
P’Vee…

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:05.540
Do we really have to role-play like P’Aokbab and Rin did?

00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:06.820
Of course we do.

00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:08.300
You’re the one who told me to.

00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:11.300
You said if we want our love to turn out beautifully like theirs—

00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:13.460
—then we should give it a try.

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:16.700
Fine…

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:18.020
Shall we start?

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:34.180
P’Vee…

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:37.380
What are you looking at? Why are you smiling like that?

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:38.180
It’s nothing.

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:39.460
Hey, look at that!

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:48.220
P’Vee…

00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:01.100
Please marry me?

00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:08.940
[Thank you, P’Aokbab and Rin—]

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:12.820
[—for showing us how beautiful love can be.]

00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:25.620
[Maybe our story began with destiny.]

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:28.340
[The destiny that brought us together.]

00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:31.980
[But from now on—]

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:34.420
[I want our story—]

00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:37.300
[—to be more than just dsetiny.]

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:44.740
[I want to write it myself—]

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:47.460
[with our own hearts.]

00:36:57.540 --> 00:36:59.340
– Thank you.
– Thank you.

[MUSIC] Midnight’s near, just a few more minutes away

00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:44.540
But my eyes still find their way to you every day

00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:47.590
Cause the lights around me shimmer endlessly

00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:52.140
But none of them shine as bright as you for me

00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:55.980
When you walk right in, my heartbeat stops in place

00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:59.810
Feels like you turn the darkest night into day

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:05.150
Never met anyone, not a single one who

00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:06.980
Feels like you

00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:08.780
Cause you

00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:10.120
Are

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:14.540
A Wonder

00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:17.700
One that’s rare and true

00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:24.890
You’re my midnight sun in the sky

00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:28.850
No matter how long, you’re glowing through the night

00:38:29.110 --> 00:38:33.160
Warm like daylight soft and kind, never burning too bright

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:36.470
Holding you this close, I never need anything more

00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:40.100
Who would believe that a midnight sun so bright

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:44.100
Could turn both night and day into the same warm light

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:46.490
Staying right here by my side

Chasing all the darkness deep inside

Far away, if you try to find one in the sky

00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:16.500
That midnight sun exists only in dreams passing by

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:23.160
But I found something real the moment you came near—when I met you

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:25.050
Cause you

00:39:25.050 --> 00:39:26.850
Are
