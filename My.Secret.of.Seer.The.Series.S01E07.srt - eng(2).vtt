Ple hasn't been following us, Win.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.760
Right?

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.120
Where did he go?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Oh?

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.400
What?!

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.480
Namo!

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.640
What the hell?!

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.240
Tong, what the f*ck
is wrong with you?!

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.960
Hey! Win!

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.840
Wait! Win!

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.120
Win!

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.680
Win, are you alright?

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.560
Win!

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.000
Tong, what the f*ck
has gotten into you?

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.680
If you see
a suspicious-looking idol,

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.160
destroy it.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.640
Tong, what is wrong with you?

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.760
Hand it over!

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.120
Tong!

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.840
What the f*ck?

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.120
Win!

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.240
Win, are you alright?

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.840
Hey, let me out!

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.600
Let me the f*ck out!

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.200
Or else I'll curse you!

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.960
Namo!

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.640
Do you believe in ghosts?

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.160
I don't.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.720
Why?

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:06.920
What are you going to do?

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.800
I just want to try something.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.040
Get up!

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.280
What are you doing?

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.160
Making both of us happy.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.120
Which page?

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:36.720
Hold on.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.520
This one.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.360
Dark magic?

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.400
Copy the pattern.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.120
Why are we doing this?

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.800
To make our wish come true.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.800
What did you wish for?

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.440
For us to be together.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.120
Being together

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:06.880
without Dad?

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.080
You know that
if he finds out about us,

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.560
he'll separate us, don't you?

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.960
Come on. Let's finish this already.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.640
Open the godd*mn door!

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.920
Come on!

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.920
Hey!

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:05.840
Please stop.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.120
We're almost there.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.360
One more time.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.680
Nothing happened.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:52.720
What's wrong with Dad?

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.240
I don't know.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.760
His arrival is near.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.240
His arrival is near.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.160
His arrival is near.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.800
His arrival is near.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.360
His arrival is near.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:44.760
Hey!

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.240
His arrival is near.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.280
Let go!

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.640
His arrival is near.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.080
His arrival is near.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.760
His arrival is near.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.400
His arrival is near.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.080
His arrival is near.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:56.960
Hands off!

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.576
- His arrival is near.
- His arrival is near...

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.440
- His arrival is near.
- His arrival is near...

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.560
- His arrival is near.
- His arrival is near...

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.640
- His arrival is near.
- His arrival is near...

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.560
- His arrival is near.
- His arrival is near.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.080
Sh*t!

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.120
Where's Master Win?

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.000
He's upstairs.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.240
Win!

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.800
Win!

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:26.480
Where's Master?

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:27.480
He's inside.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:28.520
It's locked shut.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.480
Win!

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:36.920
Win.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.200
Phloeng?!

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.800
I'm scared.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.040
It's okay.

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.440
You're fine now, Win.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:56.560
Win...

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.560
He fell asleep.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.560
At any rate,
please check up on him, Namo.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.480
If he doesn't improve tomorrow,
we'll take him to the hospital.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.320
What can we do?

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.480
If it's not urgent,
it's better for him to rest here.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.080
Things could get worse.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.960
What if he dies?

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.720
I'm going to contact
the nearest hospital for now.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.960
- Right. Thank you.
- No problem.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.560
I'm fine now, Namo.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.240
Get well soon, Win.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.000
Am I dreaming?

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.560
Isn't this too much?

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.640
What will you do
if he goes into shock?

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.720
Can you take responsibility?

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.480
Come on, Phloeng.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.800
You saw that we tried
to make everything safe, didn't you?

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.040
Well, was it that safe?

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.160
You think it's safe?
He was crying and panicking!

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.000
We don't even know
what his mental state is right now.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:32.520
So much for safety.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.800
Who knew he'd be scared
of ghosts this much?

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.800
He's usually a funny guy.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.640
I was going to make it
into a fun edit.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.320
If it's supposed to be funny,

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.920
both sides have to enjoy it.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.080
But it was only you guys
who found it funny.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:46.800
You guys are being a**holes.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.960
Why do you
have to be this upset, Phloeng?

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.920
Is it because I didn't tell you?

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.040
I just want his genuine reaction.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.120
Who gives a sh*t
if you didn't tell me that?

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.720
What bugs me
is this scummy prank on him.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.600
Uh, let's just say...

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.120
I'm sorry on everyone's behalf.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.600
I'm truly sorry.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:07.960
After this trip...

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:10.520
Your bonus,

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:11.840
trip,

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.320
and any annual occasion

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.640
are revoked.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:15.920
- What?!
- No!

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.600
- Tul...
- For real?

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.640
If you've got any problem,

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.040
feel free to talk to me in private.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.240
Phloeng,

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.960
nobody wanted this to happen.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.520
Win told me that

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.760
when he was little,

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.040
Waew took him to see
his relatives outside the city.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.120
His parents had already passed away
at that time.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.400
And he went through
something similar.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.280
What happened?

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.680
His aunt's son

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.040
tricked him and locked him
inside a crematory.

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.320
I never knew this.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.320
It was horrible.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:18.480
It was such a horrendous experience.

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.880
By the time Waew found him,

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:28.600
he was completely dazed.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.320
So he had to visit
a psychiatrist at a very young age.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.600
By the time he recovered,

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.360
he was already in high school.

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:46.880
Even though he claims
his mental state is back to normal,

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.720
a trauma is still a trauma.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.400
Even though he understood it,

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:52.000
forgave the person,

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.720
and moved on,

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.760
the scar never went away.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.120
Yet, the one who did it didn't feel
any kind of remorse.

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.120
I'm really sorry
on behalf of the crew.

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.360
Had we known this sooner...

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.240
What the hell happened?

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.120
Win.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.720
I didn't mean to do it.

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.200
What are you sorry for?

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:55.680
Everything,

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.160
including how we convinced him
to come on this trip.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.240
I'm also at fault.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:04.320
I begged him to be on this trip.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.040
Right.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.400
Next, about how he was tricked
into going to the abandoned house.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.520
You didn't know about that,

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.560
so it's not your fault.

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:19.160
I'm sorry
because I had my suspicions.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:21.360
Nokphaeng was going to do
something strange,

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.360
but I didn't stop him

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.520
since weird stuff keeps happening
at our company.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.240
Is there anything else
you're sorry about?

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.400
I'm sorry for getting there late.

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:34.680
If I were to arrive there sooner,

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.600
I might've been able to stop them.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:39.520
Right. I accept your apology.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.200
Try apologizing to him
after he wakes up.

00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:58.760
What are you doing?

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:00.960
Tul?

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:06.760
This box...

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.040
You didn't give it to Win,

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.520
yet you're going to burn it?

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.480
I'll get him what's inside the box.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.520
You tricked both Win

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.080
and me.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:18.480
Just what do you want?

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.280
What are you saying?

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:22.720
Go back to bed already.

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.160
I'm tired.

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:25.680
Wait.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.120
If you leave,

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.600
I'll tell him that

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:30.920
you tricked him.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.760
Tell him or not,

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.440
he already knows the truth.

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.840
I told you
I didn't know what I was doing.

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.360
You only think
I'm just tricking you and Win.

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.800
No matter what I say,
you still won't love me.

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:47.840
Tong.

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.520
Phloeng, you don't believe
in ghosts, do you?

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.760
However, Win is different
from those who are afraid of ghosts.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.280
You saw it yourself, didn't you?

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.280
You're saying that he saw ghosts

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.320
in that house?

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.120
I can't answer that for him.

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.760
But it wouldn't hurt
to believe a little.

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.520
Hey! What is Win doing?!

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:20.920
- Hey, Master!
- Sh*t!

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.600
Please don't jump, Master!

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.400
- Master!
- Hey, Win!

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Master!

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.400
Master!

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:30.760
Master.

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.040
Master.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:34.120
- Sh*t! Win!
- Master!

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:34.800
- Master!
- Master!

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.136
- What are you doing?!
- What's wrong, Master?

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:36.960
What happened?

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.360
- I don't know!
- Win, let him go.

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:39.360
- Let him go!
- Let him go!

00:15:39.361 --> 00:15:40.559
- Master!
- Stop!

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.080
- Master!
- Let go of him!

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:42.960
- Master!
- Master!

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Master.

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:45.040
Win!

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:47.280
Why are you like this, Master?!

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:48.520
Let go!

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.120
What is wrong with you, Win?

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:51.320
Let go...

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:53.160
I can't. He's choking him hard.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.040
Where is his strength coming from?

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:57.240
I don't know!

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:58.840
Tong, what did you do to him?

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.400
- Let go.
- Master...

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:01.760
Are you ready?

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.240
Are you ready?!

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:07.440
Let me go!

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:08.480
Master!

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:09.680
Hey, Tong!

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:10.720
Get the Buddha image.

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:13.600
- Let go.
- Let him go.

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:20.616
- Phloeng, are you still good?
- Calm down, Master.

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:21.640
Let him go, Master!

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.440
Win, pull yourself together!

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:24.800
Master!

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:25.800
- Master!
- Let him go!

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.080
- Master!
- Let go, Master!

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:28.600
Win!

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.040
Hello?

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:46.920
Hello, Wayu.

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:48.440
Win...

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.720
It's happening to Win again!

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.800
Is Phloeng with him?

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.320
He is.

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.680
An ambulance is going to take him
to the hospital soon.

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.000
Don't take him there.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.640
Bring Win to my house right now.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Your house?

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:04.800
Are you ready?

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:07.800
Are you ready?!

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:09.800
Yeah!

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:11.240
I'm f*cking ready!

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:20.920
Sleep.

00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:22.520
Go to sleep!

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.120
What the hell do you want?

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:29.680
Who are you?

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.040
I already made merit for you.

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:33.920
Pretentious.

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:35.560
You only prayed for yourself.

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.560
I do not need such merit, either.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.240
It's f*cking worthless!

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.200
Then what do you want?

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.160
I'll never tell you.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.280
If I do,

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:45.520
I'll be left in ruin.

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:46.760
Fine.

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.560
What does this mean?

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:01.160
Sleep.

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.280
No!

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.600
Explain yourself.

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.680
Win, you finally woke up?!

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.280
Namo?

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:22.840
What is wrong with you?

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.520
You're acting as if someone died.

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.056
I thought you were f*cking dead!

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.280
Don't be so rude right now.

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:30.560
Am I dead?

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000
You're not!

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:33.440
Let me see.

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.480
How are you doing?

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:39.640
Are you hurt?

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.200
And...

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.760
What is this place?

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.560
It's Elder Master Phupha's house.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:51.840
Elder Master Phupha's house?

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:53.680
Yeah.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.040
Elder Master Phupha's house.

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:57.160
Is it, like,

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.680
a medium's house?

00:18:58.840 --> 00:18:59.840
Of course.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:09.160
This place emits
very friendly and safe energy.

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:12.600
And...

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:16.040
Who is this Elder Master Phupha?

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.320
He's Phloeng's grandfather.

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.080
And...

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.640
Whose room is this?

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:27.480
Who changed my clothes?

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.800
This is Phloeng's room,

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.920
and he was the one
who changed your clothes.

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:34.680
He put on new clothes for me?

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.560
Yes, he did.

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.280
Why...

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.560
Why can't I recall anything?

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:43.480
You were possessed.

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:45.920
Possessed?

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.120
Don't tell me that back there...

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.680
I remember falling into a place.

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:02.840
My karmic creditor
also looked just like me.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.680
After that,
I can't remember anything else.

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.800
You woke up
in the middle of the night,

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:10.560
trying to jump off the second floor
of the pool villa.

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:12.720
Was I trying to do that?

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.320
I can't remember that I was.

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:16.880
You were.

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.840
Fortunately,
Phloeng pulled you back,

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.320
or else you would've fallen
to your death.

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.320
You even made sure
you'd land headfirst.

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:27.200
That would've either killed
or broken you.

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:28.440
And...

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:30.120
What else?

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:32.400
Here.

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.600
See this?

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:34.960
Sh*t...

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:37.000
I did that?

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.040
Yes, d*mn it.

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.360
You didn't hold back.

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.680
Your voice was also so deep
as if you were sick.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.680
However, you screamed
as loudly as a ghost's screech.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.160
Sh*t...

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:52.080
How did you bring me to this house?

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:53.640
Gosh.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.760
You don't need to know how.

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.200
Just know that Phloeng hugged
you for the whole night.

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.080
Did he?!

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:02.120
Yeah.

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:07.120
He was the only person
to watch over you the entire night.

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:08.880
I was there, too,
but in the distance.

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.400
I love you, but...

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.360
I also love my own life.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.560
Still, I was the one
who called Wayu,

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.360
and he told me to get you
to the house to perform a ritual

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:20.640
immediately.

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:23.040
If it were more than 24 hours later,
you would've died.

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:26.440
Does Phloeng
believe in all of this?

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.360
F*ck no.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.720
He's so d*mn stubborn,

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.200
claiming you caught
a disease in the woods,

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.640
like a fungus
that affects your brain.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.760
In the end, we brought you here

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.440
because you were acting out.

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:51.200
So it's you?!

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.320
Ow, Win?!

00:21:58.680 --> 00:21:59.960
What the f*ck is wrong with you?

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.400
Let go!

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:10.960
I'm going to kill him!

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:14.080
It was terrifying, d*mn it.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:18.000
Fortunately, we managed to bring
you to the house just in time.

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:18.960
Hands off!

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.400
Then, he performed a ritual on you.

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:25.920
Also, did you know that

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:28.440
since the incident occurred,

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.080
Phloeng hasn't returned
to the company?

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:31.280
What?

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:32.600
Seriously?

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:33.640
Yeah.

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.240
Nokphaeng called me, begging me

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:37.600
to convince him to return.

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:39.560
He said the company is in shambles

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:41.400
because they have no host
for the show.

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:43.520
It's so confusing to me.

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.560
I'm not that close to Phloeng.

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.960
If he wants you to do the job,
then that'd sound reasonable.

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:51.640
I feel so guilty right now.

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:56.040
Should I give him an offering set?

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.560
He's the one
who needs to offer it to you.

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:01.120
I've spoken to Wayu.

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.720
He said things
wouldn't have gone this badly

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.280
if the sh*tty crew

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.440
hadn't brought you
to the haunted house.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.600
Moreover, you actually saw
ghosts there,

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.920
and Tong was also possessed.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:15.440
It's a good thing
that I saved him in time.

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:17.640
Tong?

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:18.880
Yeah.

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:21.720
I broke the idol
that he always carried with him.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.400
I've also heard that
he's burned the stuff he was given.

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.400
Welcome back.

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:18.880
Win,

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.320
eat well, dear.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000
Thank you.

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:26.160
Uh, Elder...

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:28.760
How long do I have to stay here?

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.240
Until the night
of the winter solstice.

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.520
I'm going to perform
the cleansing ritual on you.

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:35.240
The winter solstice?

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:38.160
That's like weeks away, isn't it?

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:40.679
Elder Master, who is it

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:42.200
that is trying to claim Win's life?

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.320
I do not know, actually.

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:47.400
However, this person's power
is immense.

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:51.600
Someone is behind this?

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:53.240
I always thought it was a ghost.

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.520
I'm still unable
to confirm on that.

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:01.520
Whether it's a person or not,

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:03.520
it is certainly elusive.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:05.760
However, we'll soon find out
who it is.

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:07.920
Right now,

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.320
do not leave the house, dear.

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:11.840
If someone calls you,

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.480
do not go out or answer the call.

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:14.680
You must not.

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:16.800
This is very important.

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:18.680
This includes

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:20.800
those I know, too?

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:22.040
Most certainly.

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.600
Don't look so shocked.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:29.920
Why do you have to be so scared?

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:32.680
You're with Wayu and me.

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:34.560
Phloeng is also here.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:37.240
You know that each of my grandsons

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:38.960
is not just a nobody.

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:40.800
They can certainly help you, Win.

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.200
Eat up.

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.240
Don't listen to his words too much.

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:48.560
You've never changed, Phloeng.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.080
You're always a contrarian,

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:51.720
opposing everything.

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.200
Just eat up, Grandpa.

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:00.400
Right. Thanks.

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:02.120
Would you like the fish head?

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.440
Its bones
are going to choke me to death.

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:07.040
Come on, now.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:20.400
What?

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.520
Tell me.

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:25.440
How did you know Wayu?

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:30.720
I just know that
he's Phloeng's younger brother.

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:33.120
Liar.

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:34.840
I can sense a liar.

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:38.120
Your sensing power is back,
all of a sudden?

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:39.560
Whatever.

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:40.760
Just tell me

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.080
how you got to know him.

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:45.880
Yeah, we knew
each other well before.

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:50.600
We met at the same self-care course.

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:53.560
When was that?

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:55.840
A year ago, maybe.

00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:57.880
Whoa.

00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.080
And...

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:01.240
And you chose to hide it from me?

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:02.760
Well, you didn't ask me anything.

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:05.520
You have a crush on him?

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:06.640
I'm going to kick your a**.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:07.880
He's a medium, alright?

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:11.000
He's the Elder Master's successor
who now possesses his powers.

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:14.600
If I were to date him,

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.480
wouldn't it be a bit weird?

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:18.840
When making love with him,

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.040
I wouldn't know
who I was really with:

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.920
Wayu or Elder Master's spirit.

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:27.000
Gosh, Namo.

00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:29.000
I just asked you a question.

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:31.200
And you're taking it that far?

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.240
How does that question
do you any good?

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:35.960
Where is your luggage?

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.120
What luggage?

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:38.400
For your clothes.

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:40.200
I checked the closet,

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:41.680
but I didn't see any.

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:44.240
You're going to wear my clothes?

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:46.720
Who says that
I'm staying here with you?

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:47.920
What?

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:49.520
You were sleeping for three days.

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:50.960
Why should you be scared now?

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:52.960
Well...

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.400
I was unconscious
during those three days.

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.360
Phloeng has been staying with you.

00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:58.400
Are you satisfied now?

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.480
Sh*t!

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:07.920
Win...

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:09.640
Remember this.

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:11.160
No matter what happens,

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.080
always tell Phloeng
to wear a condom.

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.120
Understood?

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:15.840
How dirty-minded.

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:17.480
Safety first, you know?

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.200
Is it awkward?

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:46.040
No, it isn't.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:50.080
Why did you bring me here?

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:52.880
Doctors couldn't find a cure,

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:54.520
so it's time to turn to shamans.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.400
This means...

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:59.120
Deep down,
you do believe ghosts exist?

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.160
I don't, actually.

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.080
And...

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:08.840
How would you explain
everything that happened?

00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:10.560
A bug bite.

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:11.880
Exotic diseases.

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:13.800
Struck by a poisonous plant.

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:15.896
Either those,
or it might be a mental illness,

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:18.320
caused by being left stranded
in an abandoned house.

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:21.560
If that's the case,
shouldn't I go see a doctor?

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.680
If they can't find a cure,

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:26.680
we have to rely on
the alternatives.

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:29.640
My grandpa
studied traditional Thai medicine

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.040
in case you didn't know.

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:33.600
Even though he can't perform surgery
or major procedures,

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:36.200
he can prescribe herbal medicine.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.800
Rumors claim that he's a shaman,

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:40.400
but it's not true.

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:42.440
He simply

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:45.320
prescribes
herbal medicine accordingly.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.400
On top of that,
he knows how to persuade people.

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:50.160
That's why he became a medium.

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:53.440
That's how there are rumors
claiming that he has powers.

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:55.920
But...

00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:00.440
Elder Master
told me himself that...

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:02.680
he is a medium,

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:07.280
and he has Wayu as his successor.

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:10.760
Have you really seen
his powers, though?

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:13.760
You're disrespecting him.

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:16.320
I'm not.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.256
Just make me see them in person,

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:19.280
so I can believe him.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.000
And...

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:34.920
Why do I have to stay until
the night of the winter solstice?

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:38.000
Well, it aligns
with medical procedures, doesn't it?

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:40.200
Sickness needs to be treated.

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:42.760
Then close observation
of symptoms is required.

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.000
But you're staying at my house
instead of a hospital.

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:02.800
He once made a prophecy, though,

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:04.680
that we were meant to be together.

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.200
So...

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:08.000
He's also a fortune teller?

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:11.480
Not exactly.

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:13.920
But he once told me that

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:16.120
we made a vow in our first lives.

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:18.160
In the next lives,

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:20.800
it's as if we were bound
by its consequences,

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:22.840
except in our previous lives.

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:24.560
What happened
to our previous lives?

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:26.640
We weren't together.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.240
Why was that?

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:35.960
He said that
one of us died early on.

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.960
He didn't specify who it was.

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:43.600
All he knew was that
the one left alive was in sorrow,

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:46.040
making another vow:

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:47.616
If we were to see each other
in the next life,

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:49.000
we would never let each other go.

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:52.640
Do you believe in the prophecy?

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:54.760
If you do,

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.080
you need theories
to back up your claim.

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:01.720
I do have a theory, though.

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:03.960
What is it?

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:12.960
Date me.

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:15.520
Ridiculous.

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:17.656
You're making
that chubby face again.

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:18.880
It's not chubby.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.000
Well...

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:24.160
This is just an example.

00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:26.760
If I were to die tomorrow,

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:29.800
can I try something right now?

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:32.320
It may sound a bit weird,

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:35.000
but ever since I was born,

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:36.720
I've never kissed anyone before.

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:40.360
You want to kiss me?

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:42.600
No.

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:44.480
I said "anyone."

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:49.000
Can that be me?

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:50.880
Spirits are wandering
outside the perimeter.

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:06.640
Oh, Yok?

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:08.560
How are you doing?

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:09.880
It's been so long.

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:11.440
Do you miss me?

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:17.200
What's the matter?

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:18.960
Are you mad at me?

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:22.520
I'm sorry that
I haven't helped you.

00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:24.680
How about this?

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:27.200
If I get to meet Phloeng today,

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:29.920
I'll talk him through it.

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:30.960
Okay?

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.000
Nonsense.

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:37.480
Buy me the latest Gunpla first.

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:40.480
Sure.

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:42.480
I'll order one via a shopping app.

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:46.040
If I do, you'll stop
being mad at me, right?

00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:48.920
I want the snack
with shells and filling, too.

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:51.440
What kind of snack is that?

00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:52.240
I don't know.

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:54.960
The one
with colorful shells and filling.

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:56.560
Colorful shells?

00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:57.720
With filling?

00:34:58.920 --> 00:34:59.920
Is it...

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:02.040
Oh!

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:03.120
Macarons?

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:04.160
Sure.

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:05.440
I'll treat you to them.

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:08.240
Would you like anything else?

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000
I want...

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:11.520
Petch, what are you doing?!

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:15.200
Why are you messing around here?

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:17.280
Go and help your father!

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:19.560
Petch?

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:22.360
Yes, his name is Petch.

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.040
His name isn't Yok.

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:38.480
I deserve
to be struck down, Master.

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:40.040
We're sorry, Master.

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:42.040
Just let it be.

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.120
It's already been a while.

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:49.440
If Win actually died back there,

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:51.840
I'd sue your company
until it went bankrupt.

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:53.880
Please, Namo...

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.880
We were also in shock back then.

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:57.800
I didn't expect we'd make it.

00:35:58.200 --> 00:35:58.920
It's true.

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:02.800
I even thought that
if Phloeng got taken out,

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:05.600
the next ones would be Nokphaeng

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:07.360
and me.

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.440
Have you fully recovered, Master?

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:13.680
Did Elder Master tell you
what happened to you?

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000
Oh...

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:16.560
I'm fine now.

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:19.400
Maybe it was because of the ghosts
at the abandoned house.

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:21.000
See? I told you, Nokphaeng.

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:24.200
Everyone in that house
was murdered.

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:27.040
The locals
have been trying to hide the truth.

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:30.440
Please accept this, Master.

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:32.600
It's our apology.

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.559
Tul didn't come here by himself,

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:38.480
so he had us bring you
this money as a consolation.

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:40.160
We're truly sorry, Master.

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:42.960
It's okay, really.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000
Let's just say I've forgiven you.

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:47.960
Whatever.

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:49.640
I refuse to forgive you guys.

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:51.840
Win never gets mad at other people.

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:53.760
Just think about it.

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.336
If he jumped
off the balcony to his death

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:56.760
while possessed,

00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:57.920
what would you do?

00:36:58.280 --> 00:36:59.520
Please, Namo...

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:02.000
Please don't take
this matter to court.

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:03.720
We'll do anything you ask.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.000
But please...

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:06.480
We sincerely apologize.

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:08.400
Well then...

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:10.720
The consolation money
should've been tripled.

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:12.520
That's my line.

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:14.320
- Tripled?
- Tripled?

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:40.920
Tong?

00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:56.840
Are you good now?

00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:58.680
Mm.

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:00.800
I'm so sorry.

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:03.760
I didn't know stuff like that
would happen.

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:06.800
And...

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:08.880
Tul got this for you.

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:11.240
I never had a chance
to give it to you.

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:18.280
I didn't know what I was doing.

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:21.400
I used that stuff
because I wanted a partner.

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:23.840
I'm really sorry.

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:29.560
It's going to take a while.

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:33.080
Still, thank you.

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:35.160
Mm.

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:17.120
Win...

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:19.440
I think we're set for life.

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:22.920
I can sense a scammer.

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:24.840
What scammer?

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.320
It's the consolation money.

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:28.440
This is good, though.

00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:30.640
We're still working
with Nokphaeng either way.

00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:37.080
So, about you and Phloeng.

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:38.520
How is it going?

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:41.200
You're asking about him and me?

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:43.200
Well, what about you and Wayu?

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:45.480
What?

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:50.560
I can sense puppy love.

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:52.600
Liar!

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:54.600
You're talking out of your a**.

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:01.800
Anyway, come and stay here
for a few nights when you're free.

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:04.280
Fine. I'll come
and hang out with you,

00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:07.600
but you have to let me
do my funeral stuff, too.

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:09.360
If anything comes up,

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:10.600
just call me, okay?

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:13.360
Oh.

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:15.560
Tong got me stuff from Tul.

00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:19.480
I don't think he meant to do it.

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:23.400
It's a bit hard to say right now.

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:25.040
Mm.

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:27.720
I guess time will tell.

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:29.360
Mm.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.400
I need to make up my mind first.

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:32.960
I'll talk to him later.

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:36.240
I'll be seeing you, then.

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:37.280
I have to go now.

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:41.800
Excuse me...

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:43.880
Dad is calling you for a meal.

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:52.040
See you.

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:12.120
Win!

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:13.160
Win!

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:16.080
What the hell is it?

00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:19.480
I forgot my phone.

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:20.920
Can you go get it for me?

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:22.240
I'm too far out to do it myself.

00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:23.760
Where is it?

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:25.640
In the house.

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:27.680
Eung's probably yelling
at me right now.

00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:28.720
I'm running late now!

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:30.600
Right. Wait there.

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:31.640
I'll go get it.

00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:42.440
Win!

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:44.320
Come on! It's getting hot out here.

00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:47.080
Right!

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:49.880
Quickly!

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:01.200
Win.

00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:07.440
What the hell is this?

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:13.200
Are you for real?

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.560
Come to me.

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:27.600
Go away!

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:34.760
Don't get any closer!

00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:57.760
Who were you talking to?

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:03.840
Why are you holding a leaf?

00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:07.160
Sh*t...

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:09.480
I forgot.

00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:12.560
The real Namo
has the scent of stamens

00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:14.680
and the scent of a leather jacket.

00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:16.400
Why is that important?

00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:20.880
And who were you talking to?

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:24.360
It was Namo.

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:32.200
Win, are you ready?

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:35.680
Perhaps what you're dealing with

00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:38.400
may not simply be ghosts
or a karmic creditor.

00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:39.440
Win!

00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:40.480
Save me!

00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:41.919
Once you find me,

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:44.040
the ritual of spirit transfer
shall end.

00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:46.000
Hey, let go!

00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:47.520
Win, what's wrong?

00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:48.600
He's fighting.

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:50.520
To fully possess someone,

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:52.960
the body must not have
its soul attached to it.

00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:55.440
This means that
the host must die first!

00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:56.720
Win!

00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:57.720
Win!

00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:58.960
Wake up!

00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:08.880
Is it the work of destiny or fate?

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:16.200
I have no choice but to accept it

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:24.960
I've tried so hard,
but it's impossible to run away

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:30.720
I have to accept that
things are here to stay

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:37.120
I've always thought that
love was just a ruse

00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:44.400
I've never thought that
my true love would be you
