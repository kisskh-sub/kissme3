00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.520
So bland and tasteless.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.120
Attendants!

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.600
Bring me the wine from Wu Rong.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.600
Royal Brother,

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.800
it's been five days now.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.560
Still no word of Young Master Beicheng.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.680
I've had people searching in secret.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.600
But this is someone else's capital.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.200
From the looks of it,

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.200
they're not truly helping us search.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.320
Could it be they're

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.200
hoping we'll leave if we can't find him?

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.640
Are they stalling us on purpose?

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.560
Royal Brother, where are you going?

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.080
To see the Monarch of Ling'an.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.040
I want answers.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.080
Summon King Wurong for an audience.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.360
Step aside.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.440
Monarch of Ling'an,

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.320
it's been five days now.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.440
There's not a single clue.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.640
Are you disregarding me

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.960
and Wu Rong?

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.880
Do you not take us seriously?

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.120
I think

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.760
this alliance

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.400
isn't worth making.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.880
King Wurong, please don't rush.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.320
Searching with just a name and age

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.200
is like finding a needle in the sea.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:42.680
These past days,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.400
the Monarch and I have sent people searching.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.520
Our Monarch of Ling'an keeps his word.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.880
He spares no effort for his promises.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.080
But I wonder,

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.600
why do you bring a blade to court?

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:54.960
What does it mean?

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.600
I don't care for your customs.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.400
If in three days

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.320
we still can't find him,

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.560
Wu Rong's soldiers

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.880
will march into Ling'an's border.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.800
King Wurong,

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.640
are you trying to break our alliance?

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.440
Will you risk Wu Rong's people's safety?

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.080
We Wu Rong are born on horseback.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.080
Battle runs deep in our bones.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.240
I'm sure my people

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.200
will support my Royal Brother's choice.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.000
I

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.720
have said all I will.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.120
Now it's up to Ling'an's Monarch's sincerity.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.360
Let's go.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.640
Rui Yu, stay.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.720
Everyone else,

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:44.520
leave for now.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.760
I take my leave.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.560
Is Young Master Beicheng one of ours?

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.800
Is he?

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.880
He's not from Ling'an.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.400
When will we ever find him?

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.120
I didn't expect Wu Rong

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.600
to value Young Master Beicheng

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.720
so highly.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.280
They're willing, for him,

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.040
to go to war with Ling'an.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:17.360
The capital

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.640
truly has no news.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.440
I've sent people to search the border.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.480
If he exists,

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.080
we'll have news in three days.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.000
But if this person

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.920
is hiding his identity,

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:30.840
I'm afraid

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.680
with Ling'an's forces,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000
going to war with Wu Rong

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.320
wouldn't be difficult.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.800
But Pingxiang has just stabilized.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.240
Qian Yuan's hostage returns soon.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.280
If war breaks out now,

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.600
it may upset the long-standing balance.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:48.600
Yes.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:52.640
Rui Yu,

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.320
find a way first

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.440
to calm King Wurong and the princess.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.080
As for the alliance,

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.680
wait for news from the border.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.920
Then we'll decide what to do.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.800
Understood.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.200
Why do you look so tired?

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.440
King Wurong and Princess Muya entered the palace.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.280
They said if in three days

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.200
we still can't find Young Master Beicheng,

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.640
they'll go to war with Ling'an.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.280
I just asked my second brother for news.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.160
None of the nearby cities have a match.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.200
Next, we can only wait for border news.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:54.680
What's wrong?

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.480
It's nothing.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.240
I was thinking, King Wurong

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.400
would use his whole nation

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.520
just to find one person.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.920
It's probably because King Wurong

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.360
has deep feelings for Young Master Beicheng.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.360
These days,

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.200
he's been secretly searching everywhere.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.600
He thought he was discreet,

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:15.840
but unexpectedly,

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.920
my brother's men still found out.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.240
Luckily, it didn't endanger Ling'an's people.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.240
Otherwise, how would this end?

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.280
I've finally found you.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.600
Did you know I was searching for you?

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.600
Since the day you entered the city,

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:06.520
I knew.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.320
Then why did you wait until now to see me?

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.680
The Da Yue people are so shameless.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.280
You were hunted by them, your fate unknown.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.840
I've been worried about you all along.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.520
Don't you understand my feelings yet?

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.360
Young Master Beicheng,

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:21.880
look—

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.760
this horse is my Royal Brother's favorite.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.160
But it's wild-tempered.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:36.360
No one has tamed it yet.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.840
If you can tame this fierce horse,

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.040
then I will give it to you.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:15.240
Hyah!

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:15.960
Hyah!

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:16.880
Hyah!

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:17.920
Hyah!

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:29.800
Beicheng!

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.000
You did it!

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.520
You are the bravest warrior.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.120
As long as you keep up with its speed,

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.000
you can be its companion.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.760
Only a warrior like Young Master Beicheng

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.080
is worthy of our Wu Rong princess.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.080
Princess

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.440
I told you early on

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.320
that I am already married.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.240
My royal brother said

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:04.640
that this is nothing serious.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.200
Warriors of our grasslands

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.680
can have several wives.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.920
I would treat your wife kindly too.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.840
We could bring her back to the grasslands.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.000
I could even let her bear the eldest son.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:15.640
Princess

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:16.560
But

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.360
I am not willing.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.720
She is my only wife in this life.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.120
My love will never change.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:25.800
You...

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.560
What do you mean by that?

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.360
Are you saying you feel nothing for me?

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.960
I only respect you as Princess Muya of Wu Rong.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.320
But you protect me,

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.000
care for me—

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.600
isn't that love?

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.640
Your royal brother and I call each other brothers.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.520
I only see you as a younger sister.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.520
That's all.

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.280
Do you know,

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:50.920
my name,

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.080
Muya of Wu Rong,

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.800
means "moon" in the Wu Rong language.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.440
The grasslands are vast and endless.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:58.960
When you lose your way,

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.480
only the moon follows the lonely warrior.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.960
It lights his way home.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.680
Only the purest moon

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.800
is worthy of the bravest warrior.

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.040
If I stay in Ling An,

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.440
can I be your moon?

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:18.360
Princess,

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.360
I understand your feelings.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.440
But I already have

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.240
a moon that belongs only to me.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.600
She has always guided me,

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.120
so wherever I am,

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.480
I can find my way home.

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.000
May I meet your moon?

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.800
Please persuade King Wurong

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:47.640
that war between our nations

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.160
only harms the people.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.680
Wu Rong now has water.

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:54.880
The people of Wu Rong

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.840
deserve a stable home.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.440
I won't trouble you further.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.280
But how can I deliver these words for you?

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.440
You should tell my royal brother yourself.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:07.760
Princess,

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:09.960
I have said all I can.

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:20.920
Bring out Rui Yu.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.200
What are you trying to do?

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:23.200
Stop them!

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.040
If you don't come out—

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:24.840
Stop!

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:26.960
Master Rui,

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:30.360
King Wurong forced his way into my manor.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.120
What is your purpose here?

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.920
Was the embassy's hospitality lacking?

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.560
If the Monarch of Ling'an

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.360
learns your Rui family harbors selfish motives,

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.960
and hid Young Master Beicheng's whereabouts,

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:48.480
causing war between our nations,

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.000
then you, Rui Yu,

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.760
will be the culprit.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:54.920
Young Master Beicheng—

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.440
why would he be in my manor?

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:59.600
I met him on the street yesterday.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.520
I saw him enter your manor.

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:02.720
Do you still want to deny it?

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:03.640
Search the place!

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.280
If war truly breaks out,

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.240
my death is no matter.

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.520
But you two are in a foreign land—

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:11.040
can you expect a good end?

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.400
Wu Rong people

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.440
fight for their pride.

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.320
I may not return to Wu Rong alive,

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.760
but Young Master Beicheng has helped Wu Rong.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.320
Even if I die,

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.000
I must find him.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.120
If what Princess Muya said is true,

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:38.320
you met Young Master Beicheng yesterday,

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:39.640
and he is willing

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.240
to return to Wu Rong with you,

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.200
then why didn't he go back to Sifang Guest House?

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.600
Why did he hide in my manor

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.720
and cause all this trouble?

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:48.520
You...

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.880
King Wurong is loyal and honorable.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.800
He'd use all his power for Young Master Beicheng.

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:57.640
I, Rui,

00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:58.960
greatly admire that.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.240
But this concerns both nations.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:02.760
If because of this

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.720
both sides suffer losses,

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.400
others

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.960
will reap the benefits.

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:11.720
The day after tomorrow

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.760
is the final deadline.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.320
Master Rui,

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.560
consider this carefully.

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.120
I will wait at Sifang Guest House.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:21.840
If I don't see him,

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:22.800
this matter

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:24.280
won't be over.

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:26.480
Let's go.

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:47.400
Rui Yu,

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:49.840
are you hurt?

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:54.840
I'm fine.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:57.400
Little Yu,

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.400
to use one person

00:14:58.920 --> 00:14:59.960
to trade for an alliance between two nations—

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.280
it's truly a tempting offer.

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:04.800
King Wurong's loyalty is unmatched.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.160
Princess Muya's feelings run deep.

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:09.760
I am not their equal.

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.640
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:20.240
I just didn't want you to worry.

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:21.880
After all, I have returned.

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:39.640
That day, my second brother and I

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.120
rescued children who had been abducted.

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:45.080
I chased a suspicious Wu Rong man.

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:47.440
They knocked me out.

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:51.760
They falsely accused me

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.400
of kidnapping the young prince.

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:57.200
While I was exhausted,

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:58.720
they put shackles on me.

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.440
I became a slave.

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:05.760
Later, the Da Yue people

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:08.240
colluded to invade the Wu Rong court.

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.080
I saved King Wurong

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.480
and Princess Muya.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.000
So I was treated as an honored guest.

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:16.520
They refused to let me return to Ling An.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:20.040
I didn't want the herders to suffer Da Yue's oppression.

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.240
That's why I agreed to stay.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.960
To help King Wurong fight Da Yue.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.120
But I never agreed to marry Princess Muya.

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:28.920
That's all nonsense.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.080
My heart is only for you.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:36.520
It's a pity.

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.640
Ling An's Sifang City

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:40.240
can't compare to the freedom of the plains.

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:42.680
Young Master Beicheng can't

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.160
ride freely here.

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:47.720
What are you even talking about?

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:49.280
Princess Muya said

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.360
Ling An isn't a good place.

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:52.240
Why not?

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:53.320
It's great.

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:54.320
What's so great about it?

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:00.840
Ling An has my family.

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:03.960
It holds my childhood memories.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:08.880
More importantly,

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:13.160
Ling An has you.

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:22.600
I'll let you off this time.

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:25.000
If it happens again,

00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.560
I swear, strike me dead with lightning.

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:29.960
That's more like it.

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:35.920
Where are you going?

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:37.960
I'm going to see Princess Muya.

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:39.400
Then I...

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:40.320
You're not allowed to follow.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.000
But what if she tries something with you?

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.720
Here in Ling An,

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:46.560
no one dares act up in front of me.

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.160
That's good.

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:57.800
Even if there's some left,

00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:58.600
that's fine, right?

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:01.520
Yes.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:19.080
Princess.

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:20.080
Please.

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:21.480
Waiter.

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:24.080
Two more pots of tea, please.

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:25.000
Coming right up.

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.720
I really don't get why Beicheng insists on returning to Ling An.

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:32.680
This city of Ling An

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.320
is so small you can see its edge at a glance.

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:36.400
Stuck here, you can't go anywhere.

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.400
Back in Wu Rong,

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:40.080
he was so free.

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:42.640
He moved as gracefully as an eagle.

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.000
Only Royal Brother and I could keep up with him.

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:47.560
When we rode together,

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:48.960
those were the happiest times.

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:52.560
Where is the princess going?

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:57.320
Hurry!

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.200
Come quickly!

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:03.520
Let go!

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.680
Are all Ling An people this uptight?

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.840
Princess, just say what's on your mind.

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:12.360
Look.

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:13.840
That horse is my Baoyang.

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.160
Let me take you deep into the plains, okay?

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:18.720
No, I won't go.

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:20.520
Are you sure you won't go?

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.320
You can see Ling An from that direction.

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:26.000
I know you miss home.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:27.920
Someday,

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:30.320
I want to see where you once lived.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.480
Though I can't right now,

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:35.040
doesn't Ling An have a saying

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.320
called "Entrusting Longings Afar"?

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:42.080
Let's go.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:48.280
Hyah!

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:49.520
Hyah!

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:50.400
Hyah!

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:52.400
Hyah!

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:53.800
Hyah!

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:57.880
Hyah!

00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:58.840
Hyah!

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:05.960
Hyah!

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:07.840
Hyah!

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:08.880
Hyah!

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:11.560
That "Entrusting Longings Afar" I mentioned today—

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:12.880
Did I get its meaning right?

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.360
Sending longing from afar.

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:16.920
What's the full phrase?

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.240
Letters hard to send,

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:22.800
longings without proof.

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:24.200
I only wish the west wind would carry my feelings,

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:26.280
into your heart far away.

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.200
What does it mean?

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:32.880
Just a sentimental line.

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:34.160
Not fit for a princess.

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.640
So what does that poem really mean?

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:00.600
Can you not be so slow?

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:01.560
Hurry and tell me!

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.600
Even with the most beautiful words,

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:12.200
to record one's longing,

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.360
it's hard to find a place to send them.

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.840
Even if the longing is deep,

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:20.440
it's hard to find someone to express it to.

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:24.560
I only wish the west wind knows my feelings,

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:26.920
carries my love,

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.720
and blows it to the one I miss.

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.000
Such deep feelings.

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.480
He must really miss his wife.

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:38.520
You know he has a wife,

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.040
yet you still want to marry him?

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:42.240
Our Wu Rong warriors

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:43.880
some have many wives.

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:45.280
In Ling An,

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:47.920
aren't there concubines and secondary wives too?

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.000
As long as two people truly love each other,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.200
none of that matters.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:54.640
But...

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.440
Doesn't "jun" usually mean a man?

00:21:58.680 --> 00:21:59.800
Maybe he was thinking of

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.560
his father or elder brother.

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.360
Maybe in his heart,

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:08.160
his wife

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.840
is a woman equal to any man.

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:29.400
It's been days since we met.

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:30.640
Your Majesty has grown lazy.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:33.480
Is Your Majesty well?

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:34.880
I'm fine.

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:39.560
Brother Beicheng,

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.360
you finally showed up.

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:42.880
Come, sit.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:51.160
Put everything else aside for now.

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:52.720
Have a few drinks with me first.

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:34.280
Three cups have been finished.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:35.840
Time to get down to business.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.680
I have just one thing to say.

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:40.640
Come back to Wu Rong with me.

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.080
I'll form an alliance with Ling An.

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:46.280
And if I refuse?

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:49.440
Will you raise troops to attack the border?

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:52.760
There's no rush right now.

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.080
Perhaps

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:56.640
I could also befriend Qian Yuan.

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.080
You've met Prince Pan.

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.760
You truly are Brother Beicheng.

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:06.760
I haven't met him in person,

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.320
but I did receive his gift.

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:11.560
So,

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:12.880
you

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:14.800
how will you choose?

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.600
Wu Rong is leaderless now.

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.280
If I lead a surprise attack,

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.120
how likely do you think I'd win?

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:29.640
I don't mean to boast,

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:31.280
but you and I both know

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.920
I know your side very well.

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:36.840
But you

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:38.120
know nothing about me.

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:42.480
You've achieved nothing in Ling An.

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:46.320
No one here even knows your name.

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.160
What's the point of staying here?

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:51.480
My family,

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:53.360
my beloved,

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:55.080
and my elders

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:56.440
are all in Ling An.

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:00.440
And I have a lifelong mission to fulfill.

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.400
Whether I endure humiliation,

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.000
fight the enemy alone,

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.520
or die on the battlefield,

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:08.320
I have no regrets.

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:13.400
What you said—

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:16.280
I can relate to some of it.

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:18.560
Very well.

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:20.640
I came to find you

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.280
just to see if you were still alive.

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:26.440
That day, you were chased by Da Yue.

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:27.320
Your fate was unknown.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.360
I've long seen you as a brother in life and death.

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:31.720
Naturally,

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:33.280
I was worried and heartbroken.

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:35.640
Of course, I respect Your Highness

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:37.920
as I would an elder brother.

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:41.360
Then

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:42.960
if the Monarch of Ling'an

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.840
orders you to attack Wu Rong,

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:46.520
what will you do?

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.920
As long as Wu Rong doesn't cross our border,

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.280
I will never raise arms against Wu Rong.

00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:59.640
If the monarch insists on war,

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000
the one leading the troops

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:02.760
will not be me.

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:04.360
Alright.

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.080
Then I accept you as my brother.

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.760
If you can't stay in Ling An someday,

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.800
bring your family to Wu Rong and join me.

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:17.200
Your Highness is truly considerate.

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:18.240
I'm deeply grateful.

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:26.320
Then

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:27.840
if I need to find you in the future,

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.680
I should go to Lord Rui's residence, right?

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:31.240
Yes.

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:33.600
But

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:37.000
I've kept something from Your Highness.

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:38.240
I'm truly ashamed.

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:46.120
For certain reasons,

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.000
I had to disguise myself as a woman

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:49.360
and marry into the Rui family.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.880
So the fact that I'm actually a man—

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:54.840
please keep it secret for me.

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:55.920
I didn't expect

00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:58.600
you'd be in such a difficult situation,

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:02.080
yet still firmly refuse my offer.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:04.960
So be it.

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:07.440
I've given up completely.

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:09.760
I promise you,

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.080
I'll keep your secret.

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:17.760
Then I shouldn't stay any longer.

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:19.680
I won't trouble you further.

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.160
Alright.

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:21.200
Let me see you off.

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:23.240
Let's go.

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:34.040
Though I've made up my mind,

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:35.480
Muya

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.920
truly has deep feelings for you.

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:42.000
I made things clear to her yesterday.

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:44.560
I have no feelings for the princess.

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:46.600
Then

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:48.440
if it's for the sake of our nations,

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:49.440
I

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:51.320
insist you marry Princess Muya?

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:53.880
Why go that far?

00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:57.680
I already have someone I love.

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:00.760
And nothing will

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:02.720
diminish my feelings for her.

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:05.440
Please, Royal Brother,

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:07.280
advise the princess more.

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:08.600
I understand.

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:09.760
We

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.120
part ways here.

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:14.760
Young Master Beicheng.

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:18.360
Royal Brother, why are you stopping me?

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:21.040
Young Master Beicheng has explained everything.

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:22.000
You

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:23.920
Once we're back in Wu Rong,

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:25.680
I'll choose a husband for you.

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:26.280
Alright?

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:27.240
I don't want that.

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:28.120
The one I love

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:29.080
is Muya of Wu Rong.

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:30.240
Princess Muya,

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.480
you're a princess of the grasslands.

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:35.880
There will be braver warriors

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:36.800
who love you,

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:37.920
who respect you,

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:40.240
but that person won't be me.

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:43.120
Farewell.

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:46.160
Yu'er,

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:46.760
let's go.

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:47.800
Beicheng.

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:48.480
Enough.

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:49.400
Muya.

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:50.040
Let's go.

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:50.320
Royal Brother.

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:51.600
Listen to your brother.

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:56.600
Everyone has their own fate.

00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.440
No need to feel sorry for her.

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:01.600
She'll find a better match.

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:04.160
Why did you come to Sifang Guest House?

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:05.160
Could it be

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:05.960
you are—

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:08.280
This all started because of me.

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.000
It should end with me as well.

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:16.120
Everything is resolved now.

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:19.080
You can rest easy.

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:36.240
Your Highness.

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.600
Lady Mei asked me to give this to you.

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:41.080
She said the rainy season is coming,

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:42.920
and worries your old illness may return.

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:45.120
She had me make knee guards for you.

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:53.000
Lady Mei said

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:56.280
Yesterday, King Wurong took the princess
to the Rui family and caused trouble.

00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:57.560
She said

00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:00.280
the Young Master Beicheng they're seeking
lives at the Rui residence.

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:01.560
They even drew swords.

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:03.320
Beicheng

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.560
Sounds like an alias.

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:09.280
North versus South.

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:10.680
City versus...

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:15.200
I recall Rui Yu returned to the Nan family
during New Year.

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:17.200
Nan Chenxiao wasn't with him.

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:18.280
Yes.

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:19.920
I've asked Lady Mei.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.440
She said Nan Chenxiao left the city
to visit relatives.

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:23.600
Go investigate

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:26.800
which relatives the Nan family has
outside the city.

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:29.080
Prince, do you suspect Nan Chenxiao?

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:31.040
But...

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:32.640
But how could that be?

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:36.240
Rui Yu managed to deceive everyone
and become an official.

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.440
The Nan family did anything to avoid
the late emperor's wrath.

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:41.120
What wouldn't they dare to do?

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.360
If that's really the case,

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:46.960
then the Rui family is guilty
of deceiving the monarch.

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:49.320
In that case,

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:51.960
Lord Rui's true identity
may soon be exposed.

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:54.960
I've been in Ling An for so many years.

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:56.720
It's time I step forward

00:30:58.040 --> 00:30:59.880
and mediate for them.

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:04.400
A few days ago,

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:05.840
I dreamed of my mother consort.

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:08.200
According to Ling An's customs,

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:11.080
I should burn some ingots
to comfort her spirit.

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:12.760
Tell me,

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:16.120
is my mother consort urging me

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:18.000
to return and see her?

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:19.600
Prince, you've planned for years.

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:21.360
Your wish will surely come true.

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:30.120
Take these to the ancestral hall

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:30.880
and burn them.

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:31.400
Yes.

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:32.520
Yingshu

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:35.680
Thank you for your hard work.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.120
You mean

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:06.080
you wish to mediate between the two nations?

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:06.960
Yes.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.440
I've lived in Ling An for many years.

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:11.000
My aunt also married into the Rui family.

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:12.520
Ling An, to me,

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:14.000
has long been a second home.

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.440
Of course, I wish to ease His Majesty's burdens.

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:17.680
Since you are sincere,

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:18.400
tomorrow

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:19.800
let's hold a banquet at Sifang Guest House.

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:20.800
Let's arrange a feast.

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:25.280
This time, King Wurong brought
Princess Muya with him.

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:28.200
Why not have each family bring
their own ladies?

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:30.280
To foster friendship between our nations.

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:31.920
Let us all join in this grand event.

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:35.400
Since you've thought of everything,

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:37.800
I have no reason to refuse.

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:40.640
We'll do as you suggest.

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:43.280
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:01.400
Is it proper for me to attend
such a banquet?

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:03.800
I've already informed His Majesty.

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:05.360
Miss Qiao, you needn't worry.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:11.040
Besides,

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:12.400
today's banquet—

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:14.000
His Majesty will also attend
the banquet today.

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:16.360
You haven't seen each other
in a long time.

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:19.720
Prime Minister Ming and the others
have arrived.

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:22.360
Lord Rui

00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:25.000
Prime Minister Ming

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:26.480
This time, Lord Rui is in charge
of hosting King Wurong.

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:27.640
Lord Rui is the main organizer.

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:29.360
It's truly exhausting.

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:31.280
It's a lot of hard work.

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:34.000
It's all part of my duty.

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:36.880
It's right to share His Majesty's burdens.

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:38.760
I just didn't expect Prime Minister Ming

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.600
to attend this banquet as well.

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:42.760
After all, King Wurong

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:44.720
is a guest highly valued by His Majesty.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:45.480
Yes.

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:47.040
The Left Minister is getting old

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:49.080
and dislikes such occasions.

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:51.800
So I must represent all officials

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.240
and show our hospitality.

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:54.280
Then...

00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:55.560
Today, let's

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:56.800
not leave until we're drunk.

00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:58.520
Prime Minister Ming, your kindness
is hard to refuse.

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:01.360
But this diplomatic banquet
is of great importance.

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:03.800
I'm afraid I can't drink freely
with you today.

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:06.560
His Majesty values you.

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:08.360
Alright then.

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:09.840
I won't disturb you further.

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:10.840
Prime Minister Ming, please.

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:15.200
Prime Minister Ming

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:16.080
Please, sit, sit.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:18.840
Prime Minister Ming

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:19.920
Sit.

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:27.160
Yu'er

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:31.400
Do you see any issues?

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:32.960
No.

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:35.640
His Majesty has arrived.

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:41.880
King Wurong, you must drink
a few more cups today.

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:44.000
Please.

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:51.920
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:54.800
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:56.720
No need for formalities.

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:57.560
Everyone,

00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:58.560
please take your seats.

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:09.600
Today, Prince Pan has specially
arranged this banquet

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:11.840
to host King Wurong and all officials.

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:13.600
Everyone, feel at ease.

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:14.800
Let the banquet begin.

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:31.160
You are...

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:48.160
Princess Muya.

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:51.440
Are you not interested
in these melodies?

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:53.680
I don't like them.

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:54.480
They're too dull.

00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:57.280
Princess, please tell me
what you enjoy.

00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:59.040
I will arrange it for you.

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:02.120
We Wurong people excel
at riding and archery.

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:04.040
Why not have someone from Ling An

00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:05.600
compete with me in archery?

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:10.600
An archery contest?

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:14.080
Why not let Princess Chunxi
compete with her?

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:15.400
It's fair

00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:17.400
and respectful.

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:20.400
Princess Muya is of noble status.

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:21.680
And today,

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:23.280
Princess Chunxi is also present.

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:25.680
Why not let the two princesses

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:27.560
compete against each other?

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:29.400
I...

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:30.560
I don't know how!

00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:32.280
I'm only good at eating.

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:35.960
I can't do it.

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:37.960
But that doesn't mean all Ling An women can't.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:38.720
Alright.

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:45.080
Then I'll choose a Ling An woman
from the crowd.

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:46.360
to compete with me.

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:49.200
Then...

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:53.440
Why not...

00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:55.920
How about I compete with the princess?

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:00.280
What does the Monarch of Ling'an think?

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:04.960
As long as the princess enjoys herself.

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:07.440
Then you shall do it.
