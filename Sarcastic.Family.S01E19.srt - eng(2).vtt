00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.680
That male lead is really awful.

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:01.400
He’s a disgrace to us men.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.640
Good thing she has a great best friend.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.599
Best friend.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.639
Let me ask you something.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.919
Do women have to have a best friend?

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.120
I was watching that wildlife show.

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:15.439
The females.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.840
Like lions and stuff.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.120
The lionesses always hunt in packs.

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:20.520
They leave the males back at home.

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.439
Aren’t humans the same?

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:23.719
You’ve just got to have a best friend.

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:26.520
I think,

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:29.159
men can live without their bros,

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:30.800
but women

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.360
must have a best friend.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.240
A best friend

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:48.319
is a friend,

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.680
but not every friend is a best friend.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.680
So what kind of friend counts as a bestie?

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:58.639
You should know that better than me.

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:02.639
Then tell me what kind of friend

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:03.759
can be called a bro.

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:07.840
The kind you “share pants” with.

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:14.080
Who could share pants with me?

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.560
Her pants would reach up to my neck.

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:25.639
No way, no way.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.439
Sister Yang is suitable.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.159
Sister Yang.

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:33.360
Li Lili.

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.240
Are your eyes going bad?

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:36.879
You even filled in the wrong row.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.080
Do it again.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.159
On my desk before noon.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.439
Way too aggressive.

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:44.719
Doesn’t match my vibe.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.240
Moms are definitely gentler, kinder.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.319
She’s the one.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.960
What are you laughing at?

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.400
Auntie said my son’s poop is normal now.

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:08.080
See?

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:09.080
Looks super healthy, right?

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.000
So cute.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.919
That’s really great.

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:17.560
She’s a demon.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:22.920
What did I say yesterday?

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.279
I said the moment I walk in,

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:25.639
I want the proposal on my desk.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.759
I’m sorry.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.639
Yesterday was Sunday.

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:30.319
I don’t work on weekends.

00:04:30.519 --> 00:04:31.480
Get the hell out.

00:04:32.519 --> 00:04:33.279
Move.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.759
Is there seriously not

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:42.360
a single girl who’s compatible with me?

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:57.319
You’re new here?

00:04:58.399 --> 00:05:01.319
I—I joined a month earlier than you.

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:03.879
Then how come I’ve never seen you?

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.079
I-I don’t really talk much.

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:06.759
And,

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.959
our work doesn’t really overlap.

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:10.839
I’m basically invisible here.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.160
If there’s nothing else,

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.519
I…

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.759
I-I’m gonna go get some water.

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:25.000
So normally, utterly average.

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:27.000
Isn’t she basically my clone?

00:05:27.959 --> 00:05:29.040
She’s my destined best friend.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.360
It’s got to be you.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.360
Sis,

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.120
how many times have I told you?

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.600
All our little darlings here,

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.000
they never bark for no reason.

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:52.959
The ones barking at night, bothering folks,

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.879
are those stray dogs in the compound.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.639
That’s got nothing to do with us.

00:05:56.959 --> 00:05:59.040
Related or not, it’s still under review.

00:05:59.399 --> 00:06:00.399
And it’s not the first time

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:02.040
residents complained about your shop.

00:06:02.079 --> 00:06:03.519
So how long have you been “reviewing”?

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:04.319
By now,

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:05.959
you should have some result, right?

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.759
I still have to open and do business.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.839
I can’t keep my shutters down forever.

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:11.759
Sis, cut me some slack.

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:13.680
Your guy,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.199
Zheng Dalei, Director Zheng,

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:16.199
we used to hang out,

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:18.360
we were rock‑and‑roll best buddies.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:19.600
He’s the one who said

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.639
to care about people’s daily details,

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.800
and never let a noisy dog slide.

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:25.360
Then he clearly doesn’t know it’s me.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.240
Tell him

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.360
I’m that “rock ’n’ roll sweetie.”

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:29.879
Y‑you, you…

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:41.519
What are you doing over there?

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:44.040
Uncle Meng, a turtle died today.

00:06:44.519 --> 00:06:45.560
And a goldfish died too.

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:46.560
How do we deal with them?

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.360
Just bury them.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.839
Leave me alone, I'm annoyed.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.600
I did. Didn’t you ask me?

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:53.160
No.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.079
What about that rabbit?

00:06:54.079 --> 00:06:54.920
That one is dying too.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.519
Should we try to treat it?

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.879
Treatment will cost over 2,000.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.360
The rabbit sells for only forty.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.319
You two…

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:30.639
One can live five hundred years,

00:07:30.839 --> 00:07:32.439
one can live at most a year.

00:07:32.839 --> 00:07:34.720
Yet you’ll share the same grave.

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:36.480
But maybe that’s good.

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:37.279
On your way to the afterlife,

00:07:37.279 --> 00:07:38.560
you’ll at least have each other.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.800
Don’t mind that it’s forgetful.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.319
And don’t mind it crawls slowly.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.319
You’re the goldfish,

00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:45.279
it’s the turtle.

00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:46.959
Your future kids

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000
will be called golden beetles.

00:07:48.959 --> 00:07:49.759
From now on each year,

00:07:49.959 --> 00:07:51.399
I’ll burn paper for you two.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:53.639
Rest in peace.

00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:02.600
I’ve been waiting ages for you.

00:08:02.839 --> 00:08:03.680
The boss is rushing me.

00:08:04.199 --> 00:08:04.959
I’m already super fast.

00:08:04.959 --> 00:08:06.399
I even broke my own record.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.000
You misunderstood me.

00:08:08.439 --> 00:08:09.040
This coffee…

00:08:22.839 --> 00:08:23.639
Hurry up and drink.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:24.720
The boss is rushing me again.

00:08:25.759 --> 00:08:27.240
Doesn’t the boss eat lunch?

00:08:27.839 --> 00:08:28.319
I’ll go now.

00:08:28.319 --> 00:08:29.240
Sis, I’m going now.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.279
No.

00:08:31.279 --> 00:08:33.240
I’m done being a pathetic simp.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.919
Let’s end this on good terms.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.120
I’ll go to work right now.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:43.960
Going right now.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:44.840
Heading to work now.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:45.759
No.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.279
Let me finish watching this.

00:09:17.679 --> 00:09:18.759
Xiaomei,

00:09:19.279 --> 00:09:21.440
I feel you got me wrong today.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.840
I just think we’re quite alike.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.679
I wanted to be friends.

00:09:30.039 --> 00:09:32.000
Then how do you get a best friend?

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.799
Share juicy gossip with her.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.639
The more explosive the gossip,

00:09:35.639 --> 00:09:38.360
the closer you two will get.

00:09:43.519 --> 00:09:44.120
Um…

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:45.799
Did you know?

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.759
Rebecca stole Lucy’s boyfriend.

00:09:48.879 --> 00:09:50.519
Zhang Wei from design.

00:09:50.879 --> 00:09:52.480
The whole company knows now.

00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:54.120
Only Lucy is in the dark.

00:09:54.879 --> 00:09:56.919
Stop spouting nonsense here.

00:09:56.919 --> 00:09:58.279
Badmouthing me at work

00:09:58.279 --> 00:09:59.320
is totally pointless.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.440
I am not the other woman.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:01.120
Right.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.360
Stop stirring things up between

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.279
Rebecca and me.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.039
Yeah.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.279
Zhang Wei and I are true love.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.360
He stopped loving Lucy long ago.

00:10:06.559 --> 00:10:07.080
What?

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.200
Darn it.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.600
You home‑wrecking tramp!

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:11.240
Let go of me!

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.440
I am not the other woman!

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.960
You let me go!

00:10:27.519 --> 00:10:28.080
Make way.

00:10:46.159 --> 00:10:47.200
Xiaomei

00:10:51.639 --> 00:10:52.200
You

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:55.600
Xiaomei

00:10:56.519 --> 00:10:57.279
Xiaomei

00:10:58.679 --> 00:10:59.639
Is that you, Xiaomei?

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.240
It really is you, Xiaomei!

00:11:05.519 --> 00:11:06.919
What happened to you?

00:11:08.039 --> 00:11:09.639
Dragging myself out of bed every day

00:11:09.639 --> 00:11:10.320
just to not be late

00:11:10.519 --> 00:11:12.159
takes all my willpower

00:11:12.919 --> 00:11:14.159
No time to dress up at all

00:11:14.559 --> 00:11:15.240
Yeah

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:16.360
Anything else?

00:11:17.159 --> 00:11:18.559
No, just looking at you

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.679
You're like two different people
at work and after work

00:11:20.679 --> 00:11:21.879
Totally different

00:11:23.159 --> 00:11:25.120
Work is for survival

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:26.080
After work

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.720
is for living life

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.360
I can't stand those office people either

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.120
Pretending to be introverts

00:11:32.759 --> 00:11:33.440
to avoid trouble

00:11:36.799 --> 00:11:38.440
But you're quite different from them

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:39.720
Really?

00:11:41.039 --> 00:11:41.840
Want to be friends with me?

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:45.840
Get in

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:47.840
Let's go have fun

00:12:15.279 --> 00:12:17.919
Slow down, Xiaomei, I feel sick

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:21.480
Xiaomei, where are we going?

00:12:23.519 --> 00:12:25.759
Xiaomei, I need to use the bathroom

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.600
What are you rummaging for in my room?

00:12:40.039 --> 00:12:41.080
Nothing worth searching in your room

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.240
Looking for my own stuff

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:42.960
Found it

00:12:43.559 --> 00:12:44.120
Um

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:45.080
Tomorrow

00:12:45.519 --> 00:12:46.440
Can I ask a favor?

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:47.320
What?

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.440
I

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.159
have a friend coming over

00:12:50.639 --> 00:12:51.679
Could you... make yourself scarce?

00:12:52.399 --> 00:12:54.159
A date?

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:56.559
He, he, he

00:12:56.679 --> 00:12:57.799
He, he, he

00:12:57.879 --> 00:12:59.519
What kind of date is it between two guys?

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:00.720
Fine

00:13:01.039 --> 00:13:01.799
I can leave

00:13:02.159 --> 00:13:03.120
But not for you

00:13:03.639 --> 00:13:05.399
Our senior university is electing a monitor

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.480
I need to go vote

00:13:06.919 --> 00:13:07.519
Vote, vote, vote

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:09.360
This is my room

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.120
If anyone leaves, it should be you

00:13:11.919 --> 00:13:12.720
Fine, fine

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:15.240
This, this

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.360
Clean up yourself

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:19.600
Thanks

00:13:26.039 --> 00:13:27.120
Mummies have always been

00:13:27.279 --> 00:13:28.840
a treasure trove of information

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:29.759
about ancient Egyptian customs

00:13:30.639 --> 00:13:31.639
Ancient Egyptians believed

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.120
burying corpses

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.639
was sacrilege to life

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:37.480
They made mummies

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.000
because they believed

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:39.879
this way

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:40.679
the soul

00:13:40.679 --> 00:13:42.399
could truly rest in peace

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:44.120
Now

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.799
the art of mummification

00:13:46.399 --> 00:13:48.159
makes us intensely curious again

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.600
about ancient Egyptians

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:27.960
Um

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:28.879
Xiaomei

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.279
My head is buzzing now

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.639
I need to rest

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:39.799
What are you doing?

00:14:40.279 --> 00:14:40.759
Let's go

00:14:40.759 --> 00:14:41.200
I don't

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:41.720
I can't

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:41.919
I

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:43.200
Hurry up

00:14:45.879 --> 00:14:46.919
Having fun?

00:14:58.679 --> 00:14:59.080
Go

00:14:59.519 --> 00:15:00.159
It's so late

00:15:00.159 --> 00:15:01.159
We have work tomorrow

00:15:01.159 --> 00:15:02.240
Let's go home

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.840
It's only 1 AM

00:15:04.159 --> 00:15:05.840
Still 8 hours before work

00:15:06.039 --> 00:15:07.559
You won't spend it all sleeping

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:08.759
Come on

00:15:10.639 --> 00:15:11.279
Please

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.159
Won't they close soon?

00:15:13.159 --> 00:15:13.960
Too late

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:15.279
Sit, sit, sit down

00:15:15.559 --> 00:15:16.679
This stall's owner

00:15:16.879 --> 00:15:18.679
Just opened at 10 PM

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:19.759
Look at them

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.399
Our lives

00:15:22.639 --> 00:15:23.600
Are just beginning

00:15:23.759 --> 00:15:24.240
Boss

00:15:24.879 --> 00:15:25.919
First get me a case

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:27.240
Bring a case of beer

00:15:27.399 --> 00:15:29.039
Just my usual order

00:15:29.279 --> 00:15:30.120
Okay, no problem

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.000
Thanks

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.159
So much

00:15:34.759 --> 00:15:35.519
We'll order more if needed

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:36.120
Drink first

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.039
Got it, thanks

00:15:45.559 --> 00:15:46.200
Let me pour for you

00:15:48.279 --> 00:15:48.759
Enough, enough

00:15:48.759 --> 00:15:49.279
Okay, that's enough

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:51.639
For us

00:15:51.639 --> 00:15:52.960
First time drinking together

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:53.440
So

00:15:53.799 --> 00:15:54.600
To show sincerity

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:55.919
I'll demonstrate

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.000
Chug one for you

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:03.440
You

00:16:13.759 --> 00:16:14.360
Your turn

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:17.559
I can't

00:16:18.519 --> 00:16:19.799
Be confident

00:16:19.879 --> 00:16:20.440
Do one

00:16:24.559 --> 00:16:25.759
I really can't

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:26.639
I'll drink this

00:16:27.279 --> 00:16:27.759
Fine

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.080
Besides gossip

00:17:00.159 --> 00:17:01.279
Any other tricks?

00:17:01.759 --> 00:17:03.120
Share secrets with her

00:17:03.679 --> 00:17:04.759
The secrets shared

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.039
More private

00:17:06.279 --> 00:17:07.359
The closer your bond

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.480
Becomes

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:15.119
Xiaomei

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:17.000
I'll tell you a secret

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.480
My husband has a mole on his butt

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:25.160
Li Lili

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:26.000
Are you sleep-drunk?

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.240
What nonsense are you saying?

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.559
Menghang lied to me

00:17:33.839 --> 00:17:35.759
He was wrong too

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:36.720
Forget it

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.759
I'll go all out

00:17:39.359 --> 00:17:40.240
Throw caution to the wind

00:17:41.119 --> 00:17:42.599
I'll confess, Xiaomei

00:17:43.559 --> 00:17:44.359
I'm someone

00:17:44.359 --> 00:17:45.680
With many flaws

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.200
But a sincere heart

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.160
Our relationship

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.440
Should go further

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.359
Give me a chance

00:17:52.599 --> 00:17:53.480
Accept me

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:56.160
You're crazy

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.359
Sit down first

00:17:57.359 --> 00:17:58.160
Am I not qualified

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.359
To be your best friend?

00:18:02.759 --> 00:18:03.559
Being best friends

00:18:03.559 --> 00:18:04.319
No need to be dramatic

00:18:04.319 --> 00:18:06.039
Just tell me directly

00:18:07.039 --> 00:18:08.559
So you agree?

00:18:08.559 --> 00:18:10.000
I-I agree

00:18:10.079 --> 00:18:10.920
Sit, sit down

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:12.200
Okay okay

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:13.039
Great

00:18:15.039 --> 00:18:15.640
Cheers

00:18:16.359 --> 00:18:17.359
Cheers, cheers

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:25.039
Good

00:18:32.519 --> 00:18:33.319
You eat

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.480
Little Cannon

00:19:03.279 --> 00:19:04.640
Director Zheng Dalei

00:19:06.839 --> 00:19:08.079
If you have something

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:09.039
How about

00:19:09.599 --> 00:19:11.240
Discuss in my office

00:19:12.519 --> 00:19:12.720
No

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.240
Just old friends catching up

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:14.480
Come

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:15.039
Sit, sit down

00:19:15.119 --> 00:19:16.039
Sit, sit down

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:16.799
Sit

00:19:19.839 --> 00:19:20.440
Sit, sit, sit.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:20.799
Sit.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:22.480
By the way,

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:23.200
I'd like to ask,

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.599
about when my pet shop

00:19:24.799 --> 00:19:26.200
can open its doors?

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.319
The complaint hasn't been withdrawn.

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:30.079
Did I do something

00:19:30.359 --> 00:19:31.319
wrong?

00:19:31.839 --> 00:19:33.279
About your situation,

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:34.799
you did right,

00:19:35.519 --> 00:19:36.440
but also

00:19:37.319 --> 00:19:38.559
a bit wrong.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.799
From one perspective,

00:19:42.279 --> 00:19:43.319
you did everything right.

00:19:43.759 --> 00:19:45.720
But from another angle,

00:19:46.319 --> 00:19:47.680
I think it was wrong.

00:19:48.559 --> 00:19:49.559
Your situation

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:51.440
currently is

00:19:51.599 --> 00:19:53.400
almost completely right,

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:54.680
but still

00:19:55.039 --> 00:19:56.599
a tiny bit wrong.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:57.039
But

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.799
if we remove that

00:19:59.039 --> 00:20:00.039
little wrong part,

00:20:00.319 --> 00:20:01.119
your situation

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.559
is completely right.

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:03.559
Of course,

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:04.759
from a

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:06.759
more rigorous perspective,

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.880
I think your situation

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:10.519
is almost right,

00:20:11.039 --> 00:20:11.759
yet

00:20:12.279 --> 00:20:13.279
still a bit wrong.

00:20:15.839 --> 00:20:17.839
My poor understanding

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.119
is too limited.

00:20:20.039 --> 00:20:21.119
Let me be more direct:

00:20:21.119 --> 00:20:22.000
can my pet shop

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.160
open or not?

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:23.559
To open it,

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:25.240
we need

00:20:25.599 --> 00:20:26.559
proper reasons.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:27.279
Not to open it,

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.359
we need reasons too.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.200
What...what logic is this?

00:20:32.359 --> 00:20:33.160
Let's speak

00:20:33.319 --> 00:20:34.039
more clearly.

00:20:34.039 --> 00:20:34.880
This...this...

00:20:36.319 --> 00:20:38.359
Sometimes clarity

00:20:38.559 --> 00:20:40.200
is actually unclear.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:42.279
But sometimes unclear

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.599
is actually clear.

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:45.519
This is called

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:46.640
materialist

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.079
dialectics.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:50.599
Why do you talk like this now?

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:51.559
Back in the day,

00:20:51.559 --> 00:20:52.920
you were the most rock 'n' roll.

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.519
Who in the rock scene didn't know

00:20:54.519 --> 00:20:56.079
the name "Little Cannon"?

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:57.279
Have you forgotten?

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:58.079
That year,

00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.960
in the heavy snow,

00:21:00.119 --> 00:21:01.279
you ran shirtless,

00:21:01.359 --> 00:21:02.599
holding a torch

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.839
and the Rock Chariot flag,

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.599
running through the streets.

00:21:06.799 --> 00:21:07.640
Do you remember?

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:08.960
You ran,

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.160
with police cars,

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.279
ambulances and fire trucks

00:21:11.319 --> 00:21:12.720
chasing after you.

00:21:12.839 --> 00:21:13.960
Your passion was so raw,

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.079
your attitude so clear.

00:21:15.079 --> 00:21:15.799
Have you forgotten?

00:21:15.799 --> 00:21:16.480
Have you

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.920
forgotten our fiery youth?

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.119
Let me show you

00:21:20.359 --> 00:21:21.279
Look...look

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.480
at our passionate youth.

00:21:23.559 --> 00:21:24.279
Look,

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:27.839
Old Meng,

00:21:28.039 --> 00:21:29.640
stop embarrassing me.

00:21:30.039 --> 00:21:30.880
Now I'm

00:21:31.319 --> 00:21:32.880
a dedicated

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:35.599
public servant.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.880
If you mention that chariot again,

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.000
you're reversing history.

00:21:40.319 --> 00:21:41.640
You say don't mention it? I will!

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.640
Remember 1997 when Hong Kong, China returned?

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:44.920
At Yucai No. 2 Elementary,

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:46.160
we held that huge concert.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:47.680
You led fans

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:48.599
shouting loudly,

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:49.720
echoing to the skies.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.079
That truly showed

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:53.359
how you

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.720
connected with everyone.

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.160
You may just be little critters,

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.240
but I still can’t let you

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:08.599
pass through this world

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:09.960
without leaving a trace.

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:11.880
Even wild geese leave their cries.

00:22:12.039 --> 00:22:13.079
Why should you be any less?

00:22:14.079 --> 00:22:14.559
No, wait.

00:22:15.079 --> 00:22:16.279
Compared to wild geese,

00:22:16.519 --> 00:22:17.640
who’s the higher life form?

00:22:18.519 --> 00:22:19.160
Mammals.

00:22:19.599 --> 00:22:20.319
Birds.

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:21.599
Reptiles.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:22.440
Amphibians.

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:23.519
Paramecium.

00:22:24.279 --> 00:22:25.119
Forget it, whatever.

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:26.480
You’ve got your bro here today.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:27.640
I’ll make sure the two of you

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.599
enjoy a send-off like

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:30.319
Egyptian pharaohs.

00:22:38.839 --> 00:22:40.160
I-I-I’ll write, I’m writing now!

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.000
I’ll be done in a second!

00:22:41.279 --> 00:22:42.000
It’s me.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.720
I got home at four thirty yesterday.

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.079
I’m dead tired from that.

00:22:49.079 --> 00:22:50.160
I only slept two hours.

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:51.519
Look at me.

00:22:52.559 --> 00:22:53.400
Today I’m only functioning

00:22:53.559 --> 00:22:55.000
thanks to these.

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:57.480
You’re being so dramatic.

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:58.279
Normally I can go

00:22:58.599 --> 00:22:59.640
two days without sleep.

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:00.480
Not end up as wrecked as you.

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.000
Then you’re seriously tough.

00:23:03.599 --> 00:23:04.160
After work later,

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.119
come somewhere with me.

00:23:05.319 --> 00:23:06.440
Again?

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.079
Can I at least be home

00:23:11.079 --> 00:23:12.119
before twelve?

00:23:12.759 --> 00:23:14.119
What are you, Cinderella?

00:23:14.359 --> 00:23:16.160
Turn back into a pumpkin at twelve?

00:23:17.039 --> 00:23:18.319
Just say if you’re coming or not.

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:25.839
I’ll go.

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:27.920
But I’ve got one condition.

00:23:28.559 --> 00:23:28.920
Name it.

00:23:29.759 --> 00:23:31.960
Can we stop riding the scooter?

00:23:32.759 --> 00:23:33.960
Copy that, Xiaomei.

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:36.000
Okay.

00:23:48.079 --> 00:23:49.039
Xiaomei, no way.

00:23:49.039 --> 00:23:50.000
Give me a second.

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:54.759
This is worse than the bike.

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:55.920
Are we there yet?

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.079
Any longer and I’ll die.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.359
I swear I’m gonna kill him.

00:23:59.759 --> 00:24:00.240
What the hell?

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:00.680
Who?

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:01.920
Who are you killing?

00:24:02.279 --> 00:24:03.079
My boyfriend.

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:04.480
I recently found out

00:24:04.799 --> 00:24:06.440
he’s still tangled with his ex.

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.200
He lied he was on a work trip.

00:24:08.839 --> 00:24:09.599
I asked his coworkers—

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:10.759
turns out that was fake.

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.039
Those few days,

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:14.000
he was off seeing his ex.

00:24:15.039 --> 00:24:16.160
He’s going again today.

00:24:16.799 --> 00:24:19.079
Best friends must help each other.

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.359
Especially with relationship stuff.

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.880
You have to back her 100%.

00:24:27.559 --> 00:24:29.079
He did that?

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:30.720
Listen to me.

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.599
Two-timing guys like that

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:33.599
are absolute no-go.

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:36.319
Once I catch him,

00:24:37.799 --> 00:24:38.599
once I really catch him…

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:49.440
So where is he?

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:51.039
I’ll help you take him out.

00:24:56.359 --> 00:24:57.640
Why aren’t you holding me back?

00:24:58.720 --> 00:24:59.359
Calm down.

00:24:59.839 --> 00:25:01.000
Impulse is the devil.

00:25:04.279 --> 00:25:05.480
Your own man,

00:25:05.799 --> 00:25:07.039
you have to finish him yourself.

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:10.960
Wait here for me.

00:25:11.359 --> 00:25:12.079
This is it.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:13.480
Hang on.

00:25:15.799 --> 00:25:16.839
There’s no one here.

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:17.960
I found his car.

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:19.359
You scumbag.

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:20.640
I’ll smash up your car

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:22.000
and see how you find her now.

00:25:31.039 --> 00:25:31.519
Old Meng,

00:25:31.839 --> 00:25:32.799
I’ve got another meeting later,

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.440
so I’ll head off first.

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:35.559
Don’t.

00:25:35.559 --> 00:25:36.640
Th-this year’s new tea,

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:37.799
you haven’t even had a sip.

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:38.680
Try it, go on.

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.119
You’re insulting me here.

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:45.160
I—

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:47.680
Exactly.

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:50.200
Zhang Xiaoli has her strengths,

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:53.119
Wang Gangtie has her advantages.

00:25:54.119 --> 00:25:55.279
Who I vote for,

00:25:55.559 --> 00:25:56.880
don’t keep pushing me.

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.079
I need to think.

00:25:59.759 --> 00:26:00.559
Where’d this monkey pop out from?

00:26:01.039 --> 00:26:02.400
Director Zheng from the subdistrict.

00:26:02.599 --> 00:26:04.000
Director, deputy, whatever title—

00:26:05.119 --> 00:26:06.119
I just heard

00:26:06.319 --> 00:26:07.559
you mentioned a name.

00:26:08.079 --> 00:26:09.240
Someone called Wang Gangtie?

00:26:09.359 --> 00:26:09.720
Yeah.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.480
Our senior college is electing a monitor,

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:12.599
she’s a candidate.

00:26:13.119 --> 00:26:13.680
Right now,

00:26:14.079 --> 00:26:15.960
it’s twenty to twenty, all tied.

00:26:16.079 --> 00:26:17.079
So my one vote

00:26:17.119 --> 00:26:17.839
is especially crucial.

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:19.240
I said I’d think at home, then vote.

00:26:21.319 --> 00:26:22.359
A woman

00:26:22.519 --> 00:26:23.839
named Wang Gangtie,

00:26:24.079 --> 00:26:25.000
and then

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.839
she looks really ugly,

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.720
face screams “bad luck for her man,”

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:31.119
looks like she’s been

00:26:31.119 --> 00:26:32.279
widowed for years.

00:26:33.079 --> 00:26:34.240
She’s my wife.

00:26:35.079 --> 00:26:36.079
What a coincidence.

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:40.880
Director Zheng, you—

00:26:42.559 --> 00:26:43.440
Old Meng,

00:26:44.119 --> 00:26:45.000
you said you needed help,

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.400
why didn’t you come to me?

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:47.000
Right?

00:26:47.079 --> 00:26:48.359
My wife, you know,

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:49.640
really cares about face.

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:51.319
This senior college monitor election,

00:26:51.319 --> 00:26:52.640
she’s gone on about it for ages.

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.200
That crucial vote,

00:26:54.519 --> 00:26:55.160
that’s me,

00:26:55.279 --> 00:26:56.079
my in-laws,

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:57.519
all on me, yeah.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:03.839
Let me help you out.

00:27:05.799 --> 00:27:06.839
That vote,

00:27:06.839 --> 00:27:08.039
you’ve gotta cast it for

00:27:08.119 --> 00:27:08.960
Da Lei’s wife.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.880
Vote her and I’ll raise your salary,

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:12.880
double it.

00:27:13.119 --> 00:27:13.680
Deal.

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:16.880
Director,

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:18.519
tell sis-in-law to go prepare

00:27:18.599 --> 00:27:20.119
her monitor inauguration speech.

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:21.799
Old Meng,

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:22.960
about my thing,

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:24.319
that issue of mine—

00:27:26.599 --> 00:27:27.640
For a long time now,

00:27:28.119 --> 00:27:29.000
our subdistrict

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.240
has been really deserted.

00:27:31.279 --> 00:27:31.640
Right?

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.599
So I want to open a pet shop.

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:34.839
Besides, I really love

00:27:35.039 --> 00:27:36.200
watching

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:37.440
little cats and dogs

00:27:37.599 --> 00:27:38.400
mixing with the people,

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.720
all blending together.

00:27:40.599 --> 00:27:41.519
Like fish and water in joy,

00:27:42.359 --> 00:27:43.680
deep fish-and-water affection.

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:44.720
All blending together.

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:45.319
Yeah.

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:45.880
All right.

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:48.519
I’m off then.

00:27:48.559 --> 00:27:49.119
I’ll see you out.

00:27:49.119 --> 00:27:49.480
Okay.

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:50.799
No need.

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:51.359
I insist.

00:27:52.039 --> 00:27:53.000
Watch your step.

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:53.839
I’ll walk you a bit further.

00:27:53.839 --> 00:27:54.519
A bit further.

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.640
Earthling.

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:05.240
Brother Rabbit

00:28:05.559 --> 00:28:07.240
I'm here to give you hospice care.

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:09.039
Have a bite.

00:28:09.319 --> 00:28:10.640
At least die with a full stomach.

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:13.880
Seems you don't want to eat.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:14.720
That's okay.

00:28:16.079 --> 00:28:17.200
Eating too much makes you fat.

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:18.880
And you'll face discrimination down there.

00:28:21.559 --> 00:28:22.160
You moved!

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:23.200
What?

00:28:23.759 --> 00:28:24.839
You don't want to go yet?

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:26.079
In that case,

00:28:26.319 --> 00:28:27.240
let me help you.

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.400
This is the sexiest female rabbit

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:34.680
within five kilometers.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:36.200
Even a paralyzed rabbit

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:36.799
would jump up

00:28:37.599 --> 00:28:38.880
at the sight of her.

00:28:42.279 --> 00:28:43.640
Seems that movement earlier

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:44.799
was just a last flicker.

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:47.599
Alright then.

00:28:48.519 --> 00:28:49.759
I'll help you pass on.

00:28:50.799 --> 00:28:51.440
Don't worry,

00:28:51.519 --> 00:28:53.240
I'll give you pharaoh treatment.

00:28:53.559 --> 00:28:55.039
I'll decorate properly for you,

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:56.400
give you multiple burrows,

00:28:56.559 --> 00:28:57.400
make you quick as lightning,

00:28:57.559 --> 00:28:58.559
and... "when the rabbit's dead, cook the dog"...

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:03.799
Sorry, Brother Dog,

00:29:03.799 --> 00:29:04.839
poor choice of words.

00:29:05.039 --> 00:29:05.559
Rest assured,

00:29:05.839 --> 00:29:06.599
when the rabbit dies,

00:29:06.599 --> 00:29:07.480
I won't stew you.

00:29:14.759 --> 00:29:16.240
How about I give you a name?

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:17.680
Let's call you Judy.

00:29:22.519 --> 00:29:24.039
Do you have any idea how cheap he is?

00:29:24.279 --> 00:29:25.359
On Valentine's Day,

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.079
the roses he gave me were ones

00:29:27.079 --> 00:29:27.920
someone else threw away.

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:29.160
He took them out and gave them to me.

00:29:29.279 --> 00:29:30.519
How did you know?

00:29:30.559 --> 00:29:31.640
The little card on them...

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:33.119
It didn't have my name on it.

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.240
Wow, he's way too cheap.

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:36.200
Let me tell you, a guy like that...

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.240
you should have broken up with him long ago.

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:41.000
Let me make an introduction.

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:42.480
This is my husband, Meng Hang.

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:43.400
Hello, nice to meet you.

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:44.599
Thank you for taking care of our Lili.

00:29:45.759 --> 00:29:46.319
My best friend,

00:29:46.319 --> 00:29:46.880
Xiaomei.

00:29:49.279 --> 00:29:50.480
You found one so quickly?

00:29:51.559 --> 00:29:52.400
Um, Xiaomei...

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:54.240
just broke up with her scumbag boyfriend.

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:55.559
She's not going home tonight.

00:29:55.599 --> 00:29:56.279
She's sleeping at our place.

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:56.920
Okay, then.

00:29:57.039 --> 00:29:58.240
I'll get the sofa ready in a bit.

00:29:59.039 --> 00:30:00.680
The sofa's not very comfortable.

00:30:00.759 --> 00:30:02.000
She can squeeze in with Dad.

00:30:05.079 --> 00:30:06.000
That's not appropriate, is it?

00:30:08.319 --> 00:30:09.759
I meant you.

00:30:10.359 --> 00:30:11.759
It's not right for her to share with me either.

00:30:13.759 --> 00:30:14.799
You squeeze in with Dad.

00:30:16.559 --> 00:30:17.039
Hey...

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:19.039
You're... you're really something.

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:21.079
Come on, sit, sit, sit.

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:22.960
I think this breakup

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:24.119
was a very good thing.

00:30:24.359 --> 00:30:25.720
That boyfriend of yours...

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:28.039
Ex-boyfriend.

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:28.839
Right.

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:29.880
That ex-boyfriend of yours,

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.000
I just glanced at his photo,

00:30:32.079 --> 00:30:33.160
and I knew for sure

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.359
he wasn't the settling-down type.

00:30:34.359 --> 00:30:35.319
Right?

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:36.480
Besides,

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.079
you're the one who wanted to break up.

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:39.759
Otherwise, with our intelligence

00:30:39.839 --> 00:30:40.720
and our beauty,

00:30:40.799 --> 00:30:41.920
if you didn't want to break up with him,

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.839
could he have escaped your grasp?

00:30:43.839 --> 00:30:45.359
I'd crush him.

00:30:45.559 --> 00:30:46.599
That's the spirit.

00:30:46.599 --> 00:30:48.319
Just pretend he's already dead.

00:30:48.599 --> 00:30:49.599
With a face like his,

00:30:49.599 --> 00:30:51.079
like a dehydrated old pumpkin,

00:30:51.279 --> 00:30:53.160
who would be with him after you?

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:55.279
You're so right, Lili.

00:30:55.359 --> 00:30:56.759
But you're different.

00:30:56.839 --> 00:30:57.519
After you leave him,

00:30:57.519 --> 00:30:59.279
you can find someone better in a minute.

00:30:59.559 --> 00:31:01.240
It's a sure thing, isn't it?

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:02.160
Just say it.

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:02.799
What kind of guy do you like?

00:31:02.799 --> 00:31:03.680
I'll introduce you to one.

00:31:05.519 --> 00:31:06.559
Someone like Eddie Peng.

00:31:08.359 --> 00:31:09.039
Do you know him?

00:31:10.039 --> 00:31:10.759
You two talk.

00:31:10.759 --> 00:31:11.920
Don't... don't wait for another day.

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:13.160
Introduce me to someone today.

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.279
Eddie Peng.

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:15.079
Coming, coming.

00:31:16.359 --> 00:31:17.079
Who are you looking for?

00:31:36.039 --> 00:31:36.839
Ahao

00:31:37.039 --> 00:31:37.799
Xiaomei

00:31:38.039 --> 00:31:38.519
No

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:40.480
How did he get here?

00:31:41.839 --> 00:31:43.599
You didn't turn off location sharing?

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:44.720
Xiaomei

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:46.359
Come back with me

00:31:46.559 --> 00:31:47.240
I promise

00:31:47.599 --> 00:31:48.200
From now on

00:31:48.319 --> 00:31:49.640
I won't contact Shasha anymore

00:31:50.039 --> 00:31:51.640
What about Pingping, Lulu, and Xiaolan?

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:53.640
You smashed my car

00:31:53.799 --> 00:31:54.559
It's hard to get around

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:55.599
It's inconvenient anyway

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:56.799
So I'll stop contacting them

00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:57.720
Xiaomei

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:58.599
I promise

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:00.319
From now on

00:32:00.559 --> 00:32:01.519
I'll only love you

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:04.279
Really?

00:32:04.319 --> 00:32:04.839
Really

00:32:05.359 --> 00:32:05.960
I swear

00:32:08.279 --> 00:32:08.880
Ahao

00:32:09.759 --> 00:32:11.200
Actually, recently

00:32:11.559 --> 00:32:12.680
I've been thinking a lot

00:32:14.039 --> 00:32:15.480
Our problems

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:16.480
Are too serious

00:32:17.359 --> 00:32:19.200
Do you know the real problem?

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:21.119
What is it?

00:32:23.519 --> 00:32:24.160
It's her

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:25.839
Li Lili

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:28.119
Not only doesn't want us together

00:32:28.119 --> 00:32:29.319
But wants to set me up

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:32.279
Baby

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:33.440
From now on

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:34.599
This scheming girl

00:32:34.599 --> 00:32:35.839
Let's ignore her

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:38.640
She's the one who insisted

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:40.000
Let's not play with her, okay?

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:41.000
Hey, hey, hey

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.079
Play with me, okay?

00:32:42.079 --> 00:32:43.720
Stop, stop, stop

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:45.680
You two

00:32:46.799 --> 00:32:47.480
Get out

00:32:48.839 --> 00:32:49.640
Baby

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:50.440
Get lost

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.119
Don't be mad, baby

00:32:56.119 --> 00:32:57.160
Let's go clubbing

00:32:57.319 --> 00:32:58.240
Without you

00:32:58.400 --> 00:32:59.480
What kind of people?

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:01.400
Can't stand others being happy

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:01.839
Really

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:02.599
Annoying

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:09.519
Lili

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:10.559
It's okay

00:33:10.559 --> 00:33:13.039
This shows human diversity

00:33:13.359 --> 00:33:14.359
Betrayal by a best friend

00:33:14.359 --> 00:33:15.640
Is something every girl

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:17.119
Has to experience

00:33:18.079 --> 00:33:19.160
Go lie down inside

00:33:19.359 --> 00:33:20.400
You'll feel better

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:20.960
Come

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:25.720
Come

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:29.000
Lie down first

00:33:29.359 --> 00:33:30.640
Sis, I need to save Judy

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:33.359
Just stay there

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:35.480
I need to save Judy

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:41.880
What?

00:33:42.079 --> 00:33:42.759
Save Judy

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:43.720
Who's Judy?

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:44.400
It

00:33:45.079 --> 00:33:46.680
The moment I named it

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:48.720
I felt responsible

00:33:49.519 --> 00:33:50.400
Lend me 2,000 yuan

00:33:50.759 --> 00:33:51.480
I need to save it

00:33:52.039 --> 00:33:54.039
Dad says it's only worth 40

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:55.920
You'd spend 2,000 to save it?

00:33:56.079 --> 00:33:57.559
Life isn't measured like that

00:33:57.839 --> 00:33:59.279
Seen Saving Private Ryan?

00:33:59.279 --> 00:34:00.279
To save one soldier

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:01.559
Six died

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:02.319
Worth it?

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:03.880
Absolutely worth it

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:06.079
Because saving lives

00:34:06.079 --> 00:34:07.839
Is priceless

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:09.159
Lend me 2,000

00:34:11.079 --> 00:34:11.519
Sis

00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:12.280
Lend me 2,000

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:15.199
Your sister's upset now

00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:17.039
Don't bother her

00:34:17.519 --> 00:34:18.840
Show me your QR code

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:20.039
I'll give you

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:22.480
How much?

00:34:22.559 --> 00:34:23.119
2,000

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:25.719
Get lost

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:26.360
Fine

00:34:29.039 --> 00:34:31.280
Hurts feelings and money

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.440
It's my money

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:49.519
How was it? How was it?

00:34:49.599 --> 00:34:50.280
Have you voted?

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:51.119
Done.

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:52.400
Great!

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:54.519
Dalei's wife can finally be class monitor.

00:34:56.199 --> 00:34:57.159
I didn't vote for her.

00:34:58.519 --> 00:34:59.199
Why?

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:01.199
Wang Gangtie wore the same outfit as me.

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:02.920
Just because of this small thing?

00:35:03.199 --> 00:35:04.079
Small thing?

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:05.960
This is a huge deal!

00:35:06.519 --> 00:35:08.280
That trench coat was the latest design.

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:09.519
For women,

00:35:09.519 --> 00:35:11.679
we'd rather crash cars than match outfits.

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:12.880
What about the shop?

00:35:13.519 --> 00:35:14.199
What shop?

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.079
You forgot already?

00:35:16.159 --> 00:35:17.199
Didn't I tell you?

00:35:17.199 --> 00:35:19.039
Only by voting for her could I keep my shop.

00:35:23.119 --> 00:35:24.400
I got carried away and forgot.

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:29.360
Your excitement will be the death of me.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.400
I saw Xiaomei today.

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:41.559
Her attitude toward me completely changed.

00:35:41.559 --> 00:35:42.440
Super cold.

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.360
Looks like we can't be best friends anymore.

00:35:45.639 --> 00:35:46.679
Fine, let's not be.

00:35:46.679 --> 00:35:47.599
I'm cutting ties with her.

00:35:49.199 --> 00:35:50.559
I 100% support you.

00:35:55.079 --> 00:35:57.400
I broke up again, Lili.

00:35:57.639 --> 00:35:59.440
Can I stay at your place tonight?

00:36:04.039 --> 00:36:05.519
Absolutely not.

00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:09.920
I'm coming over now.

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.000
I'll go with you to confront him.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:11.960
I'll give him a piece of my mind.

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:20.360
For women,

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:21.159
the role of a best friend

00:36:21.159 --> 00:36:22.719
can't be replaced by a partner.

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.639
But somehow,

00:36:25.119 --> 00:36:26.719
when two best friends stay together too long,

00:36:26.719 --> 00:36:28.000
they easily have conflicts.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.480
Ironclad friendship turns plastic.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.800
Could it be because like repels like?

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:36.679
What if I change my best friend

00:36:36.679 --> 00:36:38.280
to the opposite sex?

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:42.519
Look,

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:45.079
there really is such a thing as a male best friend.

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:46.599
Menghang,

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.280
I have a great idea.

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:49.519
I'll find a man.
