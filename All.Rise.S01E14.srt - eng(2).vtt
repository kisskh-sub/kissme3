(Talent Hunt Program Day 50)

00:01:50.024 --> 00:01:52.040
(Jiang Chen 4, Huang Yue 3, Li Ke 3)

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.640
(Yan Fei 2, Guo Xiaoyu 2, Ren Jiatong 1)

00:02:02.632 --> 00:02:05.152
Eat something. I bought this for you.

00:02:07.311 --> 00:02:08.431
I have no appetite.

00:02:09.312 --> 00:02:09.831
Fei.

00:02:10.431 --> 00:02:12.591
Did you and Mr. Zhou meet
with Ms. Wang just now?

00:02:13.831 --> 00:02:15.591
At first, she refused
to talk to us at all.

00:02:15.912 --> 00:02:17.632
But eventually, she opened the door.

00:02:17.952 --> 00:02:20.831
Whether going for work injury appraisals
or labor arbitration,

00:02:20.871 --> 00:02:22.312
or making it public online,

00:02:22.312 --> 00:02:23.472
she won't back down.

00:02:23.831 --> 00:02:24.752
She wants money.

00:02:24.752 --> 00:02:26.472
She also demands explanations
from Yiaiwan.

00:02:26.952 --> 00:02:27.671
What explanations?

00:02:31.752 --> 00:02:33.792
We've been focusing solely
on the money aspect.

00:02:34.352 --> 00:02:35.551
We thought she deliberately

00:02:35.551 --> 00:02:38.568
hid the fact that Zhu Zhisheng drank
just to make Yiaiwan pay compensation.

00:02:39.792 --> 00:02:41.032
But perhaps we were wrong?

00:02:41.831 --> 00:02:43.192
What she wants goes beyond money.

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:46.792
But even if it was just about money,

00:02:46.792 --> 00:02:48.711
she only wanted funds
to treat Zhubao's illness.

00:02:49.072 --> 00:02:51.032
Ms. Wang isn't someone
who's insatiably greedy.

00:02:52.431 --> 00:02:53.352
Mr. Zhou also mentioned

00:02:53.352 --> 00:02:54.952
that the compensation amount she claimed

00:02:54.952 --> 00:02:56.591
is actually not as high as we imagined.

00:02:58.952 --> 00:03:00.472
Since she wants more than just money,

00:03:01.111 --> 00:03:01.912
what else is it?

00:03:03.912 --> 00:03:05.952
Actually, Ms. Wang said before

00:03:06.352 --> 00:03:07.671
Zhubao's coma is related

00:03:08.072 --> 00:03:10.192
to his long-term work conditions.

00:03:12.072 --> 00:03:13.352
Moreover, over a year ago,

00:03:13.352 --> 00:03:14.151
there was

00:03:14.151 --> 00:03:16.072
a similar situation at Yiaiwan.

00:03:17.591 --> 00:03:19.671
Ms. Wang didn't
go into specifics with me.

00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:22.551
Actually,

00:03:23.192 --> 00:03:24.752
there's another person who can help us.

00:03:26.391 --> 00:03:27.991
Zhu Zhisheng wasn't drinking alone

00:03:27.991 --> 00:03:29.632
that night, no?

00:03:30.991 --> 00:03:32.912
Maybe she knows something?

00:03:38.632 --> 00:03:39.111
Do you

00:03:40.151 --> 00:03:41.831
know who she is?

00:03:48.312 --> 00:03:50.111
I think we need to meet her now.

00:03:53.991 --> 00:03:54.551
I'll go.

00:03:55.512 --> 00:03:56.232
I want to see her.

00:03:56.632 --> 00:03:57.151
No.

00:03:57.792 --> 00:03:59.711
You can't meet your love rival alone.

00:03:59.792 --> 00:04:00.632
We'll go with you.

00:04:03.208 --> 00:04:04.970
(Plaintiff's Evidence Compilation
for Jurisdictional Objection)

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.888
(Send)

00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:08.271
Done.

00:04:09.431 --> 00:04:11.831
I compiled the photos we took
and timestamps

00:04:11.831 --> 00:04:13.352
into evidence documents.

00:04:13.352 --> 00:04:14.711
I also created an evidence index.

00:04:14.792 --> 00:04:15.871
All sent to Ms. Bai.

00:04:16.471 --> 00:04:17.591
The current logic is,

00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:18.512
as long as we can prove

00:04:18.512 --> 00:04:20.391
that the defendant actually operates

00:04:20.391 --> 00:04:21.632
in Chaoyang District, Beijing,

00:04:21.911 --> 00:04:23.711
the court will likely
dismiss the defendant's

00:04:23.791 --> 00:04:25.271
jurisdictional objection.

00:04:27.432 --> 00:04:28.471
We're doing brilliantly.

00:04:32.872 --> 00:04:34.192
In the lawyer pool,

00:04:34.192 --> 00:04:35.591
any task that excites you?

00:04:35.992 --> 00:04:37.872
Let's team up again for the next task.

00:04:38.271 --> 00:04:39.112
As you said,

00:04:40.271 --> 00:04:41.471
teaming up is super efficient.

00:04:43.231 --> 00:04:43.872
Order anything?

00:04:48.808 --> 00:04:51.048
(I'm always here for you.)

00:04:58.391 --> 00:04:59.031
What's that?

00:05:00.872 --> 00:05:01.351
Who is it?

00:05:01.992 --> 00:05:02.831
No one.

00:05:07.312 --> 00:05:07.992
Are you in love?

00:05:10.231 --> 00:05:11.632
You've been staring at your phone.

00:05:11.632 --> 00:05:12.992
You were so focused. Who is it?

00:05:14.512 --> 00:05:15.391
Who?

00:05:16.072 --> 00:05:16.752
Do I know her?

00:05:16.992 --> 00:05:18.192
You're so eager to know?

00:05:23.471 --> 00:05:25.031
I'm moving next week.

00:05:25.752 --> 00:05:27.471
Help me move, and I'll tell you.

00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:32.112
Actually, I suddenly realized

00:05:32.112 --> 00:05:33.391
I'm not that desperate to know.

00:05:39.271 --> 00:05:40.312
As long as it's not a girl

00:05:40.312 --> 00:05:41.312
in our firm.

00:05:45.112 --> 00:05:45.872
What do you mean?

00:05:49.952 --> 00:05:51.672
Don't you know our firm's rule?

00:05:52.512 --> 00:05:53.672
No office romance.

00:05:53.872 --> 00:05:54.791
It never works out.

00:05:55.312 --> 00:05:56.831
Take Ms. Bai and Mr. Song.

00:05:57.391 --> 00:05:59.031
They're both good and perfectly matched.

00:05:59.672 --> 00:06:00.711
And they're both single.

00:06:00.711 --> 00:06:02.112
But they just can't be together.

00:06:02.791 --> 00:06:04.911
Even if there was something
between them,

00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:07.591
the past is the past.

00:06:10.072 --> 00:06:11.031
Get out of here.

00:06:11.432 --> 00:06:12.672
Did Guo Xiaoyu possess you?

00:06:12.791 --> 00:06:13.831
Are you a romance expert?

00:06:14.312 --> 00:06:15.992
I'm just trying to protect you

00:06:15.992 --> 00:06:16.952
and guide you.

00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:18.711
I admit it.

00:06:20.192 --> 00:06:21.391
When it comes to work ability,

00:06:22.031 --> 00:06:23.231
I'm a step behind you.

00:06:23.911 --> 00:06:24.591
But when it comes

00:06:25.192 --> 00:06:25.872
to women,

00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:28.591
I know them better.

00:06:33.312 --> 00:06:34.351
I'll move next week.

00:06:34.351 --> 00:06:35.231
You help me.

00:06:35.632 --> 00:06:36.992
I want to buy you a drink

00:06:37.112 --> 00:06:39.031
and listen to your lecture.

00:06:39.432 --> 00:06:40.711
Did I agree to that?

00:06:40.831 --> 00:06:41.992
Please give me a break.

00:06:42.072 --> 00:06:42.591
No way.

00:06:42.952 --> 00:06:43.672
Right now,

00:06:43.872 --> 00:06:46.151
I just want to clock out and go home.

00:06:46.512 --> 00:06:48.231
How did it go? Did you reach them?

00:06:48.872 --> 00:06:49.391
Not good.

00:06:49.711 --> 00:06:52.231
I just got off the phone with Xiaoyu.
We need to help them out.

00:07:00.952 --> 00:07:02.151
(It's a labor dispute case.)

00:07:02.312 --> 00:07:04.312
(The employees claim
unpaid overtime pay.)

00:07:04.471 --> 00:07:05.831
(It's currently in arbitration.)

00:07:06.391 --> 00:07:07.432
Existing evidence includes

00:07:07.432 --> 00:07:08.872
attendance records and pay stubs.

00:07:08.911 --> 00:07:10.271
But the company denies it.

00:07:10.672 --> 00:07:11.632
That's all

00:07:11.711 --> 00:07:12.752
about this case now.

00:07:12.752 --> 00:07:13.151
Okay.

00:07:14.672 --> 00:07:15.711
Let's move on.

00:07:16.271 --> 00:07:17.351
Ms. Bai, may I interrupt?

00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:19.992
It's almost noon.

00:07:20.312 --> 00:07:22.231
Should we let everyone take a break?

00:07:22.471 --> 00:07:24.151
Grab some food and reconvene later.

00:07:25.672 --> 00:07:27.992
There's something crucial I need

00:07:28.231 --> 00:07:28.711
to tell you.

00:07:31.512 --> 00:07:32.072
Alright then.

00:07:32.151 --> 00:07:33.752
Let's resume at 1:00 PM.

00:07:33.872 --> 00:07:35.271
Good work, guys. Go get lunch.

00:07:51.112 --> 00:07:52.952
So what is it? You're acting mysterious.

00:07:55.271 --> 00:07:55.872
A huge thing.

00:07:57.831 --> 00:07:59.391
The last time you told me

00:07:59.672 --> 00:08:00.672
about something huge,

00:08:00.672 --> 00:08:02.351
you decided to stay

00:08:02.872 --> 00:08:03.632
at Jun An.

00:08:04.231 --> 00:08:05.672
That was 15 years ago!

00:08:05.831 --> 00:08:07.192
Can you stop interrupting?

00:08:07.952 --> 00:08:09.512
Don't tell me

00:08:09.872 --> 00:08:10.752
you're getting married

00:08:11.231 --> 00:08:12.192
and inviting me.

00:08:12.192 --> 00:08:12.831
It's about you.

00:08:14.231 --> 00:08:15.031
What about me?

00:08:15.512 --> 00:08:16.672
Does your neck hurt again?

00:08:17.312 --> 00:08:18.552
Do you know how serious

00:08:18.552 --> 00:08:19.471
it can get?

00:08:20.632 --> 00:08:21.831
Just an occupational disease.

00:08:22.271 --> 00:08:24.432
The crowd needing your protection

00:08:24.432 --> 00:08:25.752
is lined up waiting for you.

00:08:25.911 --> 00:08:27.231
Don't worry about me.

00:08:27.312 --> 00:08:28.512
My issue is minor.

00:08:28.711 --> 00:08:29.711
It might be small to you,

00:08:29.711 --> 00:08:31.231
but to me it's major.

00:08:34.792 --> 00:08:35.312
Enough.

00:08:36.272 --> 00:08:36.912
Let's talk

00:08:37.432 --> 00:08:38.111
over food.

00:08:41.751 --> 00:08:42.871
Should I invite Tian Min?

00:08:42.952 --> 00:08:43.751
Just the two of us.

00:08:52.631 --> 00:08:53.552
Ms. Bai, Mr. Song,

00:08:54.072 --> 00:08:55.032
sorry to disturb,

00:08:55.192 --> 00:08:56.871
but we have urgent matters to report.

00:08:57.591 --> 00:08:58.072
Alright.

00:08:58.432 --> 00:08:59.991
Let's hear your update first.

00:09:01.432 --> 00:09:02.472
Aren't we supposed to eat?

00:09:02.792 --> 00:09:03.351
We still are.

00:09:04.152 --> 00:09:05.952
We'll eat
right after hearing their report.

00:09:05.952 --> 00:09:06.751
Is that okay?

00:09:08.152 --> 00:09:08.591
Sure.

00:09:10.552 --> 00:09:11.392
Is that okay?

00:09:13.392 --> 00:09:13.871
Let's go.

00:09:23.471 --> 00:09:24.511
Ms. Bai, Mr. Song,

00:09:25.912 --> 00:09:27.312
here's the compiled documentation.

00:09:27.711 --> 00:09:29.711
We've already briefed Mr. Zhou.

00:09:29.912 --> 00:09:31.312
Yiaiwan's HR department

00:09:31.351 --> 00:09:32.032
has obtained

00:09:32.032 --> 00:09:34.231
surveillance footage
from every company entrance.

00:09:34.511 --> 00:09:35.471
Well,

00:09:35.871 --> 00:09:37.711
if you agree it's necessary,

00:09:37.991 --> 00:09:39.552
we could pre-emptively notarize

00:09:39.552 --> 00:09:40.552
this route.

00:09:41.312 --> 00:09:41.792
This way,

00:09:41.792 --> 00:09:43.912
whether for future negotiations
or labor arbitration,

00:09:44.152 --> 00:09:45.351
we'll have prepared evidence

00:09:45.351 --> 00:09:46.631
beforehand.

00:09:46.831 --> 00:09:47.552
We've drafted

00:09:47.552 --> 00:09:49.231
an initial guideline
for the notarization.

00:09:50.672 --> 00:09:52.751
Jiang Chen, swap seats with Ms. Bai.

00:09:53.111 --> 00:09:53.672
Sit opposite.

00:09:57.192 --> 00:09:57.991
Ms. Bai, please.

00:10:00.792 --> 00:10:02.552
Proceed. I'll be right back.

00:10:05.511 --> 00:10:07.432
Ms. Bai, Li Ke and I
researched the consequences

00:10:07.432 --> 00:10:09.072
of defrauding workers' compensation.

00:10:09.312 --> 00:10:09.912
As stipulated

00:10:09.912 --> 00:10:11.552
in Article 88
of the Social Insurance Law

00:10:11.552 --> 00:10:13.751
and Article 32
of the Social Insurance Fund Supervision

00:10:13.751 --> 00:10:14.871
and Administration Measures,

00:10:15.231 --> 00:10:17.072
fraudulently obtained funds
shall be returned.

00:10:17.111 --> 00:10:20.032
Impose fines no less than twice
the defrauded amount, not exceeding five.

00:10:20.032 --> 00:10:21.312
The severe circumstances

00:10:21.312 --> 00:10:22.231
constitute fraud.

00:10:22.711 --> 00:10:23.351
We've also

00:10:23.351 --> 00:10:24.991
sent this to Ren Jiatong and the others.

00:10:26.871 --> 00:10:28.152
The content is substantial.

00:10:28.991 --> 00:10:30.552
But this isn't your job, right?

00:10:31.792 --> 00:10:32.471
Ms. Bai.

00:10:32.471 --> 00:10:33.792
We've done our primary jobs.

00:10:33.991 --> 00:10:35.871
We just want
to show some extra initiative.

00:10:36.631 --> 00:10:38.231
Ms. Bai, we're not in Hangzhou.

00:10:38.312 --> 00:10:40.231
So we could only provide

00:10:40.231 --> 00:10:41.192
supportive assistance.

00:10:41.591 --> 00:10:42.871
But we actually want to try

00:10:42.871 --> 00:10:43.991
to plead for them.

00:10:44.392 --> 00:10:45.032
What's it about?

00:10:45.952 --> 00:10:47.111
The firm won't penalize them.

00:11:04.952 --> 00:11:06.952
What will happen
after that girl arrives?

00:11:07.751 --> 00:11:08.991
What will they talk about?

00:11:10.351 --> 00:11:11.032
Beats me.

00:11:11.471 --> 00:11:13.591
Guo Xiaoyu seems calm now.

00:11:14.032 --> 00:11:15.672
But no matter what that girl says later,

00:11:16.072 --> 00:11:18.152
her heart will surely ache.

00:11:22.032 --> 00:11:23.591
I've been there too.

00:11:24.432 --> 00:11:25.751
But I don't

00:11:25.751 --> 00:11:26.871
remember what was said.

00:11:28.831 --> 00:11:30.552
I only remember how bright the sun was.

00:11:31.711 --> 00:11:33.272
London is rainy all year round.

00:11:33.672 --> 00:11:35.192
But that single day wasn't.

00:11:36.552 --> 00:11:38.471
I couldn't open my eyes on my way home.

00:11:39.272 --> 00:11:41.231
When I reached home,
my brain was in tumult.

00:11:41.871 --> 00:11:42.711
When my eyes opened,

00:11:43.751 --> 00:11:44.912
I was in the hospital.

00:11:51.192 --> 00:11:51.912
You're right.

00:11:55.631 --> 00:11:58.032
It wasn't deadly despair over some man.

00:11:58.751 --> 00:12:00.312
I just wanted to learn a lesson.

00:12:00.912 --> 00:12:02.111
Never get hurt by men again.

00:12:03.751 --> 00:12:04.711
You mean

00:12:04.831 --> 00:12:06.471
you won't date anyone?

00:12:06.952 --> 00:12:07.552
No.

00:12:10.152 --> 00:12:11.471
Love deserves courageous pursuit.

00:12:12.792 --> 00:12:14.192
Nowadays, people fear

00:12:14.192 --> 00:12:15.511
that love might not work out

00:12:15.672 --> 00:12:16.552
or they'll get hurt,

00:12:16.552 --> 00:12:18.711
so they claim
they don't need to be in love.

00:12:18.952 --> 00:12:20.192
It's like savoring desserts.

00:12:20.471 --> 00:12:22.471
They flood you with endorphins.

00:12:22.792 --> 00:12:25.192
The side effects? Potential weight gain.

00:12:25.471 --> 00:12:26.672
Does it mean

00:12:26.912 --> 00:12:28.952
swearing off desserts forever?

00:12:29.432 --> 00:12:31.272
Even if you gain,
fitness can restore you.

00:12:31.631 --> 00:12:32.952
Plus strengthen your vitality.

00:12:33.272 --> 00:12:34.272
Well said.

00:12:34.831 --> 00:12:35.591
What about you?

00:12:36.111 --> 00:12:37.231
When Xiaoyu let you choose

00:12:37.231 --> 00:12:38.672
between love and career,

00:12:38.792 --> 00:12:40.631
you chose career, right?

00:12:47.631 --> 00:12:48.272
She's here.

00:12:56.032 --> 00:12:57.231
Should we head over there too?

00:13:00.111 --> 00:13:01.231
Why so tense?

00:13:01.312 --> 00:13:02.952
My girl's confronting her rival.

00:13:02.952 --> 00:13:04.231
What if she gets hurt?

00:13:06.192 --> 00:13:06.991
Well,

00:13:07.312 --> 00:13:09.312
if hair-pulling erupts publicly,

00:13:09.351 --> 00:13:10.631
shouldn't we think of a way

00:13:10.871 --> 00:13:11.831
to fight back?

00:13:14.032 --> 00:13:14.952
No need.

00:13:15.952 --> 00:13:16.912
She came alone.

00:13:17.111 --> 00:13:17.912
No match against me.

00:13:18.231 --> 00:13:19.672
Exactly, she's alone.

00:13:19.672 --> 00:13:21.511
Three against one? We're not bullies.

00:13:22.672 --> 00:13:24.471
What magic dust
does Zhu Zhisheng possess?

00:13:24.711 --> 00:13:26.751
To dupe both girls so completely?

00:13:32.552 --> 00:13:34.272
Is Guo Xiaoyu crying?

00:13:41.432 --> 00:13:42.032
Guo Xiaoyu.

00:13:43.072 --> 00:13:43.912
Did she hurt you?

00:13:44.511 --> 00:13:45.152
Fei.

00:13:49.552 --> 00:13:51.192
I haven't seen you
around Yiaiwan lately.

00:13:51.952 --> 00:13:52.711
Did you take leave?

00:13:53.792 --> 00:13:54.631
I resigned.

00:13:56.072 --> 00:13:57.912
I refuse to drown
in this complicated matter.

00:13:59.631 --> 00:14:00.351
Well,

00:14:00.792 --> 00:14:01.552
you guys talk.

00:14:02.032 --> 00:14:02.831
I'm leaving now.

00:14:03.631 --> 00:14:04.272
She hurts you,

00:14:04.272 --> 00:14:05.272
and you sit here weeping?

00:14:05.471 --> 00:14:06.511
Where's your backbone?

00:14:06.631 --> 00:14:07.831
Ren Jiatong and I back you up.

00:14:08.792 --> 00:14:09.432
In fact,

00:14:10.432 --> 00:14:11.751
I'm the one who failed Zhubao.

00:14:16.831 --> 00:14:18.792
Thank you for telling me the truth.

00:14:20.312 --> 00:14:22.711
Only now do I figure it all out.

00:14:24.111 --> 00:14:24.792
What?

00:14:25.751 --> 00:14:26.751
I'll be going now.

00:14:29.871 --> 00:14:30.272
Wait.

00:14:33.272 --> 00:14:35.272
Actually, he talked so much to me

00:14:35.272 --> 00:14:36.392
about you.

00:14:37.032 --> 00:14:38.552
I've always known you well.

00:14:39.471 --> 00:14:40.432
I really envy you.

00:14:41.072 --> 00:14:42.111
But between him and me,

00:14:42.912 --> 00:14:44.272
it's not what you imagine.

00:15:00.471 --> 00:15:01.351
She's already gone.

00:15:01.471 --> 00:15:03.072
If you want to cry, shout, and vent,

00:15:03.272 --> 00:15:04.072
we're here for you.

00:15:07.471 --> 00:15:08.072
That's right.

00:15:09.111 --> 00:15:10.351
She's not feeling great either.

00:15:11.111 --> 00:15:12.952
Her feelings for Zhu Zhisheng are real.

00:15:13.312 --> 00:15:14.672
Are you really that magnanimous?

00:15:15.032 --> 00:15:15.831
It's not like that.

00:15:16.631 --> 00:15:18.711
I don't feel
I have anything to vent about.

00:15:19.792 --> 00:15:21.591
If this were
just an ordinary rivals meeting,

00:15:21.751 --> 00:15:23.231
we definitely wouldn't act like that.

00:15:24.511 --> 00:15:25.711
Because our current situations

00:15:25.711 --> 00:15:26.792
are just too similar.

00:15:28.192 --> 00:15:29.392
We've both endured the pain

00:15:29.912 --> 00:15:31.152
of being torn between choices

00:15:31.471 --> 00:15:33.351
and facing life's unpredictability.

00:15:35.552 --> 00:15:36.152
Surprisingly,

00:15:36.711 --> 00:15:37.711
we understand each other.

00:15:38.552 --> 00:15:40.111
I've already told her all this.

00:15:42.871 --> 00:15:44.072
Stop pretending you're fine.

00:15:44.552 --> 00:15:46.432
Tell me who's prettier between you two?

00:15:48.711 --> 00:15:50.111
Get out of here.

00:15:52.111 --> 00:15:53.952
How about getting you some good food?

00:15:54.511 --> 00:15:55.591
Yes, something sweet.

00:15:56.152 --> 00:15:57.792
Southerners all like sweet food, right?

00:15:58.552 --> 00:16:00.072
What kind of stereotype is that!

00:16:00.392 --> 00:16:01.231
Then let's drink.

00:16:02.312 --> 00:16:03.831
It's too early. Bars aren't open yet.

00:16:04.111 --> 00:16:05.711
You just want an excuse to drink.

00:16:06.152 --> 00:16:06.711
Hold on.

00:16:08.351 --> 00:16:09.792
When did you two become so close?

00:16:11.672 --> 00:16:12.792
Who said we're close?

00:16:18.672 --> 00:16:21.792
So, you had a good talk
with your love rival.

00:16:21.991 --> 00:16:23.072
Got anything interesting?

00:16:23.871 --> 00:16:25.111
She just told me

00:16:25.711 --> 00:16:26.871
that Zhu Zhisheng ranked last

00:16:26.871 --> 00:16:28.272
during the last two months

00:16:28.272 --> 00:16:29.312
of company evaluations.

00:16:29.751 --> 00:16:31.152
His stress was overwhelming.

00:16:31.471 --> 00:16:33.192
He couldn't even sleep for ages.

00:16:33.272 --> 00:16:34.831
That's why he kept taking those pills.

00:16:35.351 --> 00:16:36.392
Sometimes,

00:16:36.672 --> 00:16:38.231
he relied on alcohol to fall asleep.

00:16:39.711 --> 00:16:41.711
Given his overtime records,

00:16:42.751 --> 00:16:43.831
he pushed himself hard.

00:16:44.591 --> 00:16:46.432
Who isn't struggling just to survive?

00:16:49.871 --> 00:16:51.871
I knew he was under constant pressure.

00:16:52.351 --> 00:16:53.871
But I didn't see this happening.

00:16:54.672 --> 00:16:56.231
He feared if he performed poorly

00:16:56.231 --> 00:16:56.991
and got eliminated,

00:16:57.312 --> 00:16:58.192
I wouldn't be back.

00:16:58.272 --> 00:16:59.871
So he worked overtime desperately.

00:17:00.792 --> 00:17:03.672
Yiaiwan didn't force his overtime.
But they got a stack-ranking system.

00:17:04.192 --> 00:17:05.751
Is this all from that girl?

00:17:07.991 --> 00:17:09.592
He just wanted to perform better

00:17:10.352 --> 00:17:11.392
and get you back.

00:17:12.271 --> 00:17:14.432
He hoped to protect you,
take care of you,

00:17:14.791 --> 00:17:17.192
and give you a relaxed, happy life.

00:17:17.672 --> 00:17:18.632
He wanted you

00:17:18.632 --> 00:17:20.112
to be happy forever.

00:17:22.912 --> 00:17:24.711
He was happy
every time he talked about you.

00:17:26.192 --> 00:17:27.832
I envy you so much.

00:17:30.872 --> 00:17:32.872
That's why you cried just now?

00:17:36.551 --> 00:17:39.271
On the day he collapsed, his manager
had just talked with him.

00:17:39.711 --> 00:17:40.392
He was told

00:17:40.711 --> 00:17:41.711
that in the evaluation,

00:17:41.791 --> 00:17:42.952
he'd likely rank last again.

00:17:42.991 --> 00:17:44.071
Without one final push,

00:17:44.112 --> 00:17:45.392
he'd be fired outright.

00:17:45.791 --> 00:17:47.152
He broke down completely.

00:17:47.311 --> 00:17:49.031
He drank heavily that night.

00:17:50.192 --> 00:17:50.952
Xiaojing said

00:17:51.311 --> 00:17:52.551
he couldn't understand

00:17:52.551 --> 00:17:54.152
why he still got such terrible results

00:17:54.471 --> 00:17:55.991
after working so hard.

00:17:59.471 --> 00:18:00.031
Wait.

00:18:00.511 --> 00:18:01.751
With such intense pressure,

00:18:01.991 --> 00:18:03.832
he still found time
to meet another girl?

00:18:04.112 --> 00:18:05.112
Could you believe that?

00:18:07.592 --> 00:18:08.832
Yan Fei, I trust him.

00:18:09.271 --> 00:18:10.352
Not because I'm love-blind.

00:18:11.112 --> 00:18:12.271
It's because he and I

00:18:12.311 --> 00:18:13.832
are both workplace rookies.

00:18:14.592 --> 00:18:16.311
I know exactly how it feels

00:18:16.311 --> 00:18:17.392
for underperforming

00:18:17.711 --> 00:18:19.392
and the panic when facing elimination.

00:18:20.471 --> 00:18:21.872
I feel tremendously guilty.

00:18:22.192 --> 00:18:23.551
When he was under so much strain,

00:18:23.551 --> 00:18:25.192
I completely failed to notice.

00:18:25.392 --> 00:18:26.592
Seeing the pills he took,

00:18:26.592 --> 00:18:27.832
I'm really kicking myself.

00:18:30.432 --> 00:18:31.271
So I've decided.

00:18:31.271 --> 00:18:32.711
I must do something for him.

00:18:34.152 --> 00:18:35.352
We're from Jun An.

00:18:36.192 --> 00:18:37.672
We must be professional as lawyers.

00:18:37.672 --> 00:18:38.511
That's right.

00:18:38.711 --> 00:18:40.592
Currently, we represent Yiaiwan.

00:18:40.872 --> 00:18:43.192
We gather evidence
to prove Yiaiwan's innocence.

00:18:43.872 --> 00:18:44.432
Does that mean

00:18:44.432 --> 00:18:45.791
we can't do anything else?

00:18:46.392 --> 00:18:47.672
Ms. Wang believes

00:18:47.672 --> 00:18:48.912
Zhu Zhisheng's health got worse

00:18:48.912 --> 00:18:50.311
for he frequently worked overtime.

00:18:50.832 --> 00:18:52.311
Zhu Zhisheng's recent coma

00:18:52.632 --> 00:18:53.912
completely enraged Ms. Wang.

00:18:54.271 --> 00:18:54.952
That's why

00:18:54.952 --> 00:18:56.592
she's determined to sue Yiaiwan.

00:18:58.231 --> 00:19:00.511
So what she truly seeks
isn't compensation,

00:19:00.711 --> 00:19:02.912
but a formal apology from Yiaiwan?

00:19:04.991 --> 00:19:06.672
Getting Yiaiwan to apologize?

00:19:08.751 --> 00:19:09.511
Don't be silly.

00:19:12.551 --> 00:19:14.711
Mr. Zhou,
as Yiaiwan's legal representative,

00:19:14.711 --> 00:19:16.791
we should absolutely
think of our client.

00:19:17.071 --> 00:19:19.271
However, many Yiaiwan employees

00:19:19.271 --> 00:19:20.432
are watching this case.

00:19:21.271 --> 00:19:22.551
If Yiaiwan could

00:19:22.551 --> 00:19:24.711
offer Zhu Zhisheng compassion
and support,

00:19:25.031 --> 00:19:27.271
such as humanitarian compensation,

00:19:27.551 --> 00:19:29.872
it would both placate Zhu Zhisheng's mom

00:19:30.031 --> 00:19:31.551
and enhance corporate image.

00:19:31.711 --> 00:19:32.311
So who exactly

00:19:32.311 --> 00:19:34.152
should propose this to Yiaiwan then?

00:19:34.791 --> 00:19:35.192
Me?

00:19:35.592 --> 00:19:36.952
Mr. Song? Or Mr. Zhuang?

00:19:37.872 --> 00:19:38.432
Mr. Zhou,

00:19:38.912 --> 00:19:39.832
are you saying

00:19:39.952 --> 00:19:40.991
we can't suggest this?

00:19:41.152 --> 00:19:41.632
No.

00:19:41.952 --> 00:19:42.672
This approach

00:19:42.672 --> 00:19:43.991
should originate from Yiaiwan's

00:19:43.991 --> 00:19:44.912
PR department,

00:19:45.112 --> 00:19:46.311
not us lawyers.

00:19:52.592 --> 00:19:53.632
I understand you

00:19:54.071 --> 00:19:55.592
and admire your passion,

00:19:56.112 --> 00:19:57.192
but if you weren't blinded

00:19:57.192 --> 00:19:59.152
by your enthusiasm,

00:19:59.152 --> 00:20:00.071
you'd notice

00:20:00.551 --> 00:20:01.952
this proposal contains

00:20:02.112 --> 00:20:03.511
zero legal counsel.

00:20:03.832 --> 00:20:05.872
It's fundamentally a PR strategy.

00:20:06.471 --> 00:20:07.392
Here's the distinction

00:20:07.551 --> 00:20:09.152
between legal and PR roles.

00:20:09.152 --> 00:20:10.592
We lawyers

00:20:10.592 --> 00:20:12.031
deliver specialized legal advice,

00:20:12.751 --> 00:20:14.751
while PR professionals
provide PR solutions.

00:20:15.592 --> 00:20:16.152
Is that clear?

00:20:20.152 --> 00:20:20.672
Sorry.

00:20:21.311 --> 00:20:23.192
I know I'm excluded from this case,

00:20:23.672 --> 00:20:24.872
so I won't step in.

00:20:25.231 --> 00:20:26.592
But may I ask one thing?

00:20:27.352 --> 00:20:28.832
Is demanding an apology impossible?

00:20:36.551 --> 00:20:37.632
I'll say it again.

00:20:38.511 --> 00:20:39.872
Lawyers do what they should do.

00:20:39.872 --> 00:20:41.112
PR does what they should do.

00:20:41.551 --> 00:20:43.031
Demanding apologies

00:20:43.711 --> 00:20:45.192
is not what a lawyer should do

00:20:45.192 --> 00:20:46.311
professionally.

00:20:46.912 --> 00:20:47.711
Serving clients

00:20:47.872 --> 00:20:50.152
without delivering sound legal counsel

00:20:50.152 --> 00:20:51.112
and expertise

00:20:51.432 --> 00:20:52.271
is disrespectful to

00:20:52.271 --> 00:20:54.311
the fundamental standards
of law practice.

00:20:56.511 --> 00:20:57.511
Unlike PR strategies,

00:20:57.991 --> 00:21:00.231
legal opinions demand greater certainty.

00:21:00.432 --> 00:21:01.592
When clients consult us,

00:21:02.112 --> 00:21:03.152
they expect

00:21:03.152 --> 00:21:04.511
definitive answers.

00:21:05.392 --> 00:21:05.952
Lawyers

00:21:06.311 --> 00:21:08.551
must take responsibility

00:21:08.711 --> 00:21:10.311
for our legal guidance.

00:21:10.952 --> 00:21:11.471
Understand?

00:21:15.192 --> 00:21:15.751
Mr. Zhou,

00:21:16.311 --> 00:21:17.791
thank you for explaining,

00:21:19.352 --> 00:21:20.791
but I have something to add.

00:21:21.031 --> 00:21:21.551
Go ahead.

00:21:24.152 --> 00:21:26.632
Chronic overtime is routine at Yiaiwan,

00:21:26.632 --> 00:21:28.071
and their imminent IPO is a fact.

00:21:28.352 --> 00:21:30.071
This legal dispute

00:21:30.112 --> 00:21:32.311
triggered a PR crisis for Yiaiwan.

00:21:32.432 --> 00:21:34.192
It risks prompting regulatory scrutiny

00:21:34.192 --> 00:21:36.912
during their IPO process.

00:21:37.231 --> 00:21:39.551
To avoid exorbitant costs and delays

00:21:39.751 --> 00:21:42.192
from future regulatory hurdles,

00:21:42.511 --> 00:21:44.912
offering employee compensation now

00:21:44.912 --> 00:21:45.832
is advantageous

00:21:45.832 --> 00:21:47.152
and worthwhile,

00:21:47.352 --> 00:21:48.791
benefiting the company overall.

00:21:50.071 --> 00:21:50.632
Excellent.

00:21:51.231 --> 00:21:52.231
You now grasp

00:21:52.392 --> 00:21:53.192
why Yiaiwan

00:21:53.192 --> 00:21:55.192
truly requires our legal involvement.

00:21:55.672 --> 00:21:56.352
Thank you.

00:22:01.791 --> 00:22:02.632
I'll take this call.

00:22:04.791 --> 00:22:05.192
Hello?

00:22:10.791 --> 00:22:11.271
What is it?

00:22:13.751 --> 00:22:14.632
Zhubao woke up.

00:22:17.991 --> 00:22:19.112
What exactly happened?

00:22:19.872 --> 00:22:22.112
Actually, Zhu Zhisheng woke up
the day before yesterday.

00:22:22.432 --> 00:22:23.991
Ms. Wang didn't let me tell you.

00:22:24.152 --> 00:22:25.952
But I know he wants to see you now.

00:22:26.551 --> 00:22:28.632
The dispute between Ms. Wang and Yiaiwan

00:22:28.791 --> 00:22:30.471
might be over now.

00:22:31.031 --> 00:22:33.192
Because my dad
privately gave 500,000 to her.

00:22:33.672 --> 00:22:35.152
Apart from medical expenses,

00:22:35.551 --> 00:22:37.432
the remaining money
counts as compensation.

00:22:38.031 --> 00:22:39.592
Your dad? Privately?

00:22:41.912 --> 00:22:44.152
My dad is Zhu Zhisheng's
direct department head.

00:22:44.471 --> 00:22:45.751
My dad wants me to join Yiaiwan

00:22:45.751 --> 00:22:47.231
right after graduation.

00:22:47.511 --> 00:22:49.471
So he frequently had Zhu Zhisheng

00:22:49.471 --> 00:22:51.471
tutor me on my graduation project.

00:22:51.872 --> 00:22:53.031
Zhisheng helped me after work

00:22:53.231 --> 00:22:54.711
with my project, then return

00:22:54.912 --> 00:22:56.231
to the office to work overtime.

00:22:57.392 --> 00:22:58.231
So that's how it was.

00:22:59.031 --> 00:23:00.112
I threatened my dad.

00:23:00.271 --> 00:23:01.352
If he didn't pay Zhisheng,

00:23:01.511 --> 00:23:02.991
I'd expose this scandal.

00:23:03.271 --> 00:23:04.912
A corporate executive scandal

00:23:05.152 --> 00:23:06.912
wouldn't be good for their IPO.

00:23:08.511 --> 00:23:09.311
Thank you.

00:23:09.751 --> 00:23:10.952
Don't. It's my fault.

00:23:11.592 --> 00:23:13.592
Nothing happened
between Zhu Zhisheng and me,

00:23:13.872 --> 00:23:16.672
but I know you still got hurt.

00:23:17.112 --> 00:23:18.672
Thanks for protecting my feelings.

00:23:20.231 --> 00:23:20.872
Not at all.

00:23:22.112 --> 00:23:23.711
My dad agreed to pay

00:23:24.271 --> 00:23:25.711
not just because I threatened him.

00:23:26.311 --> 00:23:28.271
He made me agree to a deal.

00:23:29.192 --> 00:23:30.872
I can never see Zhu Zhisheng again.

00:23:35.711 --> 00:23:36.991
He's waiting for you upstairs.

00:23:37.392 --> 00:23:38.031
Go ahead.

00:23:39.791 --> 00:23:40.271
Thank you.

00:23:46.568 --> 00:23:50.664
(Neurosurgery)

00:23:57.031 --> 00:23:58.511
Zhubao, how are you?

00:23:59.071 --> 00:23:59.912
Xiaoyu.

00:24:00.071 --> 00:24:00.791
Careful.

00:24:00.991 --> 00:24:02.392
The doctor said you need to rest.

00:24:04.872 --> 00:24:05.471
Xiaoyu.

00:24:07.192 --> 00:24:07.711
Zhubao.

00:24:08.551 --> 00:24:09.271
I've decided.

00:24:11.031 --> 00:24:11.632
I'm staying.

00:24:12.231 --> 00:24:13.832
I'll stay in Hangzhou for you.

00:24:15.311 --> 00:24:16.592
Let's start over completely.

00:24:18.271 --> 00:24:20.432
You used to take care of me.
From now on,

00:24:20.751 --> 00:24:21.791
I'll take care of you too.

00:24:25.471 --> 00:24:26.216
You don't have to.

00:24:27.912 --> 00:24:28.432
Xiaoyu.

00:24:29.352 --> 00:24:30.071
It was my fault.

00:24:31.392 --> 00:24:32.231
I made a mistake.

00:24:33.751 --> 00:24:35.551
What do you mean?

00:24:39.112 --> 00:24:40.912
Xiaojing told me

00:24:43.192 --> 00:24:45.192
nothing happened between you two.

00:24:45.392 --> 00:24:46.471
You just clicked with her.

00:24:46.832 --> 00:24:48.192
Is that true, Zhubao?

00:24:50.471 --> 00:24:51.152
I'm sorry.

00:24:52.471 --> 00:24:53.031
Xiaoyu.

00:24:54.311 --> 00:24:55.432
I actually...

00:24:56.991 --> 00:24:57.832
The truth is,

00:24:57.912 --> 00:24:58.872
I have feelings for her.

00:25:00.511 --> 00:25:01.592
I drank that night

00:25:02.751 --> 00:25:03.912
because I wanted to confess.

00:25:13.751 --> 00:25:14.352
Is that so?

00:25:16.071 --> 00:25:17.352
At first, I didn't realize,

00:25:18.311 --> 00:25:20.271
but after spending time with her,

00:25:21.031 --> 00:25:22.192
I slowly realized

00:25:23.471 --> 00:25:24.352
how I looked at her

00:25:24.352 --> 00:25:25.952
reminded me of seeing you at 18.

00:25:30.592 --> 00:25:32.231
I know this sounds terrible,

00:25:33.551 --> 00:25:34.711
but Xiaoyu, you know what?

00:25:35.031 --> 00:25:35.912
I desperately wish

00:25:35.912 --> 00:25:37.872
we could go back to the past.

00:25:38.432 --> 00:25:39.352
But now...

00:25:40.231 --> 00:25:41.432
We can't go back.

00:25:43.632 --> 00:25:44.711
I messed it up.

00:25:46.991 --> 00:25:48.352
I didn't know how to tell you.

00:25:53.632 --> 00:25:54.112
I know.

00:26:08.872 --> 00:26:09.872
These earrings

00:26:10.392 --> 00:26:12.872
were my eighteenth birthday gift
from you.

00:26:32.392 --> 00:26:33.271
Do you regret it?

00:26:34.672 --> 00:26:35.192
No.

00:26:39.511 --> 00:26:41.071
Over these four years,

00:26:41.791 --> 00:26:43.071
you've been my best lover

00:26:43.872 --> 00:26:45.112
and closest friend.

00:26:47.152 --> 00:26:48.912
We've been through so much together.

00:26:49.912 --> 00:26:51.352
All your care for me was genuine.

00:26:54.471 --> 00:26:55.352
And don't worry

00:26:55.352 --> 00:26:56.912
about me being heartbroken.

00:26:57.231 --> 00:26:59.071
I'll be swamped with work.

00:27:00.432 --> 00:27:02.991
When I return to Beijing, I'll work hard

00:27:03.551 --> 00:27:05.231
and become an excellent lawyer.

00:27:06.152 --> 00:27:06.632
You

00:27:06.952 --> 00:27:08.352
rest well and recover fully.

00:27:09.551 --> 00:27:10.071
I'm leaving.

00:27:12.872 --> 00:27:13.471
Xiaoyu.

00:27:16.471 --> 00:27:18.231
Th-Thank you.

00:27:20.511 --> 00:27:21.751
I wish you a bright future.

00:28:40.832 --> 00:28:41.471
Jiatong.

00:28:42.632 --> 00:28:43.672
How are you, Xiaoyu?

00:28:43.672 --> 00:28:44.711
Did you cry?

00:28:45.711 --> 00:28:46.711
Not at all!

00:28:49.112 --> 00:28:51.991
Yan Fei is picking you up. Mr. Zhou
and I will see you at the airport.

00:29:10.352 --> 00:29:11.791
Jiatong, you know what?

00:29:12.271 --> 00:29:15.632
Yan Fei drove a convertible
to pick me up.

00:29:18.711 --> 00:29:20.791
(Ren Jiatong)
Miss Yan has plenty of connections.

00:29:21.031 --> 00:29:23.071
Why did it take you so long to come out?

00:29:23.672 --> 00:29:25.751
You didn't get back together
with him, did you?

00:29:26.352 --> 00:29:27.432
If you did,

00:29:27.432 --> 00:29:28.711
I'd throw you into the West Lake

00:29:28.711 --> 00:29:29.912
to sober you up!

00:29:30.071 --> 00:29:30.791
You're a lawyer.

00:29:30.791 --> 00:29:32.471
How can you resort to violence?

00:29:32.711 --> 00:29:33.672
Can we do it

00:29:33.711 --> 00:29:34.952
in a gentle way?

00:29:36.352 --> 00:29:37.872
What way I use

00:29:37.912 --> 00:29:39.551
is none of your concern.

00:29:39.991 --> 00:29:42.751
I guarantee to get Guo Xiaoyu safely
to the airport

00:29:42.751 --> 00:29:44.112
and finish the task you assigned.

00:29:45.912 --> 00:29:46.952
I'll hang up now.

00:29:46.952 --> 00:29:47.952
See you at the airport.

00:29:57.288 --> 00:30:00.392
(Delete Contact: Zhubao)

00:30:00.991 --> 00:30:01.471
Deleted.

00:30:02.711 --> 00:30:03.511
Here you go.

00:30:04.751 --> 00:30:06.432
I even made a bet with Ren Jiatong.

00:30:06.511 --> 00:30:08.432
I bet you wouldn't
get back together with him.

00:30:10.872 --> 00:30:11.711
I would,

00:30:12.271 --> 00:30:13.991
but you'd thrown me into the West Lake.

00:30:15.672 --> 00:30:16.711
He dumped me.

00:30:26.392 --> 00:30:28.271
So I have no other choice now.

00:30:29.192 --> 00:30:29.872
I've decided.

00:30:30.511 --> 00:30:32.392
I'm going back to Beijing
to keep fighting.

00:30:34.952 --> 00:30:35.551
Good for you!

00:30:36.832 --> 00:30:37.271
Let's go.

00:30:54.872 --> 00:30:56.071
Ms. Bai, this legal opinion

00:30:56.071 --> 00:30:57.311
needs your final review.

00:31:03.192 --> 00:31:03.832
Well done.

00:31:04.791 --> 00:31:05.511
It's good.

00:31:07.031 --> 00:31:08.311
While the others are away,

00:31:08.311 --> 00:31:09.031
you've done great.

00:31:09.592 --> 00:31:11.192
I know you've handled many tasks

00:31:11.192 --> 00:31:12.471
and completed them excellently.

00:31:13.152 --> 00:31:13.912
Thank you, Ms. Bai.

00:31:14.352 --> 00:31:16.632
Hard work always gets noticed.

00:31:17.271 --> 00:31:18.511
I'll keep striving.

00:31:21.832 --> 00:31:23.872
Ms. Bai, this pen case is exquisite.

00:31:23.991 --> 00:31:24.872
Is this pen good?

00:31:25.751 --> 00:31:27.432
A friend gave it to me.
Haven't tried yet.

00:31:28.192 --> 00:31:29.912
I've seen this in magazines before.

00:31:29.912 --> 00:31:30.952
Couple-themed pens.

00:31:31.432 --> 00:31:32.112
It's a pair.

00:31:32.432 --> 00:31:34.192
One honors Queen Victoria,

00:31:34.192 --> 00:31:35.751
the other honors Prince Albert.

00:31:35.991 --> 00:31:37.031
For their legendary love.

00:31:39.271 --> 00:31:39.991
Really?

00:31:42.112 --> 00:31:43.152
I had no idea.

00:31:51.471 --> 00:31:51.912
Look.

00:31:52.912 --> 00:31:55.271
This is definitely the pen
Mr. Song uses.

00:31:55.912 --> 00:31:57.592
It's exactly
one of the couple-themed pens

00:31:57.592 --> 00:31:58.832
Huang Yue mentioned.

00:31:59.432 --> 00:32:00.952
My photographic memory never fails.

00:32:00.952 --> 00:32:01.832
I'm certain.

00:32:01.832 --> 00:32:02.551
It's the one.

00:32:03.192 --> 00:32:03.832
Calm down.

00:32:05.432 --> 00:32:06.751
Mr. Song does use this pen.

00:32:07.112 --> 00:32:09.031
But that doesn't logically prove

00:32:09.031 --> 00:32:11.152
that Ms. Bai has the matching one.

00:32:11.152 --> 00:32:12.192
Why not?

00:32:13.152 --> 00:32:14.551
I've seen this pen too.

00:32:14.592 --> 00:32:16.231
Even the case is identical.

00:32:16.511 --> 00:32:16.952
I told you.

00:32:17.271 --> 00:32:19.551
And the scarf
Mr. Song gave Ms. Bai last time

00:32:19.632 --> 00:32:20.872
was sprayed with perfume.

00:32:20.952 --> 00:32:23.031
Ms. Bai's signature fragrance.

00:32:23.711 --> 00:32:24.991
Now matching pens.

00:32:25.152 --> 00:32:26.592
No wonder they're your idols.

00:32:26.791 --> 00:32:28.071
They're perfect for each other.

00:32:29.751 --> 00:32:30.952
Aren't they together?

00:32:31.751 --> 00:32:32.952
I don't think so.

00:32:33.952 --> 00:32:35.791
Whether the scarf or the pens,

00:32:36.112 --> 00:32:37.912
Mr. Song's thoughtful enough.

00:32:38.192 --> 00:32:39.632
But I feel

00:32:40.352 --> 00:32:41.392
Ms. Bai seems hesitant.

00:32:42.112 --> 00:32:43.672
Logically, there are no barriers

00:32:43.672 --> 00:32:45.192
between them.

00:32:45.271 --> 00:32:46.071
So what?

00:32:46.311 --> 00:32:47.192
There were, maybe.

00:32:47.672 --> 00:32:49.791
Ms. Bai, a capable idol of mine,

00:32:49.791 --> 00:32:51.192
doesn't take a step.

00:32:51.192 --> 00:32:51.912
It means

00:32:52.672 --> 00:32:54.471
she was deeply hurt before.

00:32:54.471 --> 00:32:55.632
A crisis of trust emerged.

00:32:56.311 --> 00:32:57.112
Once you

00:32:58.192 --> 00:32:58.791
lose trust

00:32:59.352 --> 00:33:00.311
from a woman,

00:33:01.432 --> 00:33:02.672
it becomes hard to restore it.

00:33:05.511 --> 00:33:06.592
I understand this well.

00:33:09.071 --> 00:33:11.112
But what exactly happened back then?

00:33:11.112 --> 00:33:12.271
It destroyed the trust.

00:33:13.632 --> 00:33:14.511
Could it be

00:33:14.751 --> 00:33:16.791
that Mr. Song cheated?

00:33:18.152 --> 00:33:18.912
Impossible.

00:33:18.912 --> 00:33:20.392
Mr. Song isn't that kind of person.

00:33:20.912 --> 00:33:21.711
But I guess

00:33:21.711 --> 00:33:22.711
both of them

00:33:22.912 --> 00:33:24.672
back then prioritized staying at Jun An

00:33:25.311 --> 00:33:26.872
as their most important goal.

00:33:28.231 --> 00:33:29.711
At least, one of them did.

00:33:30.471 --> 00:33:31.952
So they missed their chance.

00:33:33.672 --> 00:33:35.751
That might be the case.

00:33:50.791 --> 00:33:51.632
My driver's here.

00:33:51.672 --> 00:33:52.392
I give you a lift?

00:33:52.872 --> 00:33:53.912
I'll just grab a cab.

00:33:54.152 --> 00:33:54.751
I live far.

00:33:54.872 --> 00:33:56.552
Rush-hour traffic.
Don't take the long way.

00:33:56.672 --> 00:33:58.271
How far could it be? Come with us.

00:33:58.352 --> 00:33:59.311
Exactly, Mr. Zhou.

00:33:59.311 --> 00:34:01.432
You'd have to queue forever for a taxi!

00:34:01.872 --> 00:34:03.511
Dragging your luggage would be a hassle.

00:34:03.632 --> 00:34:06.280
It's fine. All of you, get home safe.
Text me when you're home.

00:34:08.432 --> 00:34:09.071
Bye, Mr. Zhou.

00:34:12.111 --> 00:34:13.671
Mr. Zhou took care of us on this trip.

00:34:13.671 --> 00:34:14.991
He must have been exhausted.

00:34:15.511 --> 00:34:17.151
He probably wants to leave quickly.

00:34:18.352 --> 00:34:20.432
But we learned so much from Mr. Zhou.

00:34:20.872 --> 00:34:21.832
He always claimed before

00:34:21.832 --> 00:34:23.511
he became a junior mentor for the bonus,

00:34:23.712 --> 00:34:26.272
but he was genuinely teaching us.

00:34:26.432 --> 00:34:27.912
He's seriously saving up money.

00:34:28.312 --> 00:34:30.832
He asked me about housing prices
in Hangzhou before.

00:34:30.912 --> 00:34:32.671
He plans to settle down in Hangzhou.

00:34:32.912 --> 00:34:33.591
Hangzhou?

00:34:52.151 --> 00:34:52.432
Here.

00:34:52.912 --> 00:34:53.952
Thanks.

00:35:07.392 --> 00:35:08.591
We're not away that long,

00:35:08.752 --> 00:35:10.912
yet it feels like centuries have passed.

00:35:25.031 --> 00:35:26.551
We haven't been back for days.

00:35:26.712 --> 00:35:27.792
We have no time to clean.

00:35:27.792 --> 00:35:28.631
It's all dusty.

00:35:29.031 --> 00:35:29.792
Don't lie down yet!

00:35:36.872 --> 00:35:38.191
Everything seems the same,

00:35:38.471 --> 00:35:40.191
yet fundamentally, nothing's the same.

00:35:41.792 --> 00:35:42.432
Jiatong.

00:35:45.071 --> 00:35:45.952
Well,

00:35:46.591 --> 00:35:48.511
would we ever end up like them?

00:35:48.872 --> 00:35:50.631
Blend in with the light
and be with the dust.

00:35:55.071 --> 00:35:56.712
Seriously? You're a law student,

00:35:56.712 --> 00:35:57.952
not studying statutes or cases,

00:35:58.312 --> 00:35:59.392
but reading Tao Te Ching?

00:36:00.832 --> 00:36:01.352

00:37:01.352 --> 00:37:02.511

(We've always been here.)

00:37:32.712 --> 00:37:34.151
(Always here.)

00:37:49.392 --> 00:37:50.111
What?

00:37:51.191 --> 00:37:51.991
What's wrong?

00:37:55.312 --> 00:37:55.952
Nothing.

00:37:58.671 --> 00:38:00.671
I'm just a little touched.

00:38:17.471 --> 00:38:19.591
I'm usually very strong.

00:38:21.191 --> 00:38:22.912
But whenever those closest to me

00:38:22.912 --> 00:38:24.511
care about me,

00:38:25.792 --> 00:38:26.872
I feel aggrieved.

00:38:33.912 --> 00:38:34.752
Jiatong.

00:38:35.671 --> 00:38:36.551
Thank you all.

00:38:42.151 --> 00:38:43.671
Xiaoyu, open the door quickly!

00:38:43.952 --> 00:38:44.591
I'm exhausted.

00:38:58.511 --> 00:38:59.792
- Why are you all here?
- Xiaoyu!

00:38:59.792 --> 00:39:00.471
We came together.

00:39:08.352 --> 00:39:09.191
Get moving now,

00:39:09.191 --> 00:39:10.511
and you won't overthink anymore.

00:39:20.591 --> 00:39:22.111
First time I've seen you so flustered.

00:39:22.432 --> 00:39:24.031
Just didn't expect it in the kitchen.

00:39:24.511 --> 00:39:25.631
Need help?

00:39:26.111 --> 00:39:26.471
No.

00:39:29.031 --> 00:39:29.471
Fei.

00:39:30.031 --> 00:39:32.392
What was this used for before?

00:39:32.471 --> 00:39:33.352
Why do you care?

00:39:35.111 --> 00:39:35.631
Fine.

00:39:36.631 --> 00:39:37.511
Housekeeping pro.

00:39:46.272 --> 00:39:47.752
What made you guys suddenly think of

00:39:47.752 --> 00:39:48.872
helping me clean today?

00:39:50.832 --> 00:39:52.111
Thanks to Jiang Chen.

00:39:52.232 --> 00:39:53.752
He kept asking when the flight landed.

00:39:53.792 --> 00:39:55.232
He insisted on bringing us

00:39:55.232 --> 00:39:56.471
all together here

00:39:56.471 --> 00:39:57.191
when we were free.

00:39:57.232 --> 00:39:58.432
Surprisingly,

00:39:58.471 --> 00:39:59.352
while we were away,

00:39:59.352 --> 00:40:01.511
Jiang Chen missed me most.

00:40:04.111 --> 00:40:05.471
Wait a minute.

00:40:06.432 --> 00:40:07.392
You came to my home

00:40:07.392 --> 00:40:10.272
not just for me, right?

00:40:12.991 --> 00:40:14.111
Can you say it?

00:40:14.272 --> 00:40:15.352
Is this appropriate?

00:40:15.352 --> 00:40:16.752
I came only to see you.

00:40:17.551 --> 00:40:19.712
Today's star is only you.

00:40:19.832 --> 00:40:20.671
Cheers.

00:40:20.912 --> 00:40:22.392
Welcome back to the team. Cheers!

00:40:22.471 --> 00:40:23.631

00:40:23.631 --> 00:40:24.191

00:40:45.232 --> 00:40:46.312
That's all

00:40:46.312 --> 00:40:47.872
about our business trip to Hangzhou.

00:40:48.872 --> 00:40:50.151
Please share your thoughts.

00:40:50.432 --> 00:40:51.071
Let's discuss.

00:40:57.471 --> 00:40:59.551
Mr. Song, Ms. Bai, Mr. Zhou.

00:41:00.151 --> 00:41:01.071
I used illness

00:41:01.071 --> 00:41:02.432
as a pretext

00:41:02.432 --> 00:41:03.952
to take leave for Hangzhou.

00:41:04.471 --> 00:41:05.712
I apologize for that.

00:41:08.071 --> 00:41:08.511
Mr. Zhou.

00:41:10.111 --> 00:41:11.591
Was her leave procedure compliant?

00:41:12.272 --> 00:41:12.752
Sure.

00:41:13.031 --> 00:41:14.591
Guo Xiaoyu applied for personal leave.

00:41:14.712 --> 00:41:16.832
No fake medical certificates
submitted for sick leave.

00:41:16.872 --> 00:41:18.151
It followed our firm's rules.

00:41:18.191 --> 00:41:19.272
She promptly reported

00:41:19.272 --> 00:41:20.191
the conflict to me.

00:41:21.511 --> 00:41:22.071
Xiaoyu.

00:41:22.432 --> 00:41:23.111
Don't worry.

00:41:23.551 --> 00:41:24.232
Our firm

00:41:24.232 --> 00:41:25.671
doesn't forbid taking leave.

00:41:25.912 --> 00:41:26.991
Just comply with the rules.

00:41:28.272 --> 00:41:29.471
Ms. Bai, your thoughts?

00:41:29.792 --> 00:41:30.511
I agree.

00:41:33.031 --> 00:41:33.952
Thank you all.

00:41:33.952 --> 00:41:35.232
I'll work harder from now on.

00:41:36.671 --> 00:41:38.071
Additionally, let's see

00:41:38.071 --> 00:41:39.151

00:41:39.591 --> 00:41:40.591
Guo Xiaoyu sat out

due to a conflict.

00:41:42.151 --> 00:41:44.792
Ren Jiatong and Yan Fei excelled
in Hangzhou.

As Mr. Zhou mentioned,

00:41:49.952 --> 00:41:51.952
your performance was outstanding.

00:41:51.952 --> 00:41:53.591
Remarkable for your experience level.

00:41:53.752 --> 00:41:55.392
You clearly identified

00:41:55.551 --> 00:41:56.392
why Yiaiwan

00:41:56.392 --> 00:41:57.591
must have our firm

00:41:57.591 --> 00:41:59.232
send lawyers to Hangzhou.

00:41:59.591 --> 00:42:00.952
You provided a solution.

00:42:01.272 --> 00:42:03.112
It balanced the interests
of multiple parties.

00:42:03.432 --> 00:42:03.991
Pretty good.

00:42:04.312 --> 00:42:04.872
Ms. Bai.

00:42:04.952 --> 00:42:06.392
You rarely praise someone so much.

00:42:06.872 --> 00:42:07.792
I'm jealous.

00:42:09.031 --> 00:42:09.712
Thanks, Ms. Bai

00:42:09.712 --> 00:42:10.511
and Mr. Song.

00:42:10.792 --> 00:42:11.832
I'll keep working hard.

00:42:12.952 --> 00:42:13.511
What's more,

00:42:13.511 --> 00:42:16.232
the three members in Beijing
verified the business address.

00:42:16.232 --> 00:42:17.031
They did well.

00:42:17.432 --> 00:42:19.111
