I...

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:39.450
I actually thought

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:42.000
maybe it was because
we fell out of love.

I just think I'm ridiculous.

00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:18.670

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:19.640
I'd found true love.

Yes.

I'm done dwelling on it.

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:53.200
That heartless Wu Fu.

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:55.490
Better forget him quickly.

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:57.266
We have everything we need.

00:17:57.288 --> 00:17:58.730
Why not live a new life?

00:17:58.910 --> 00:17:59.810
Dump him!

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:01.320
Start a new life!

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:02.700
Start a new life!

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:04.640
- Start a new life!
- A new life!

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:46.090
Sister.

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:51.200
You made this?

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:53.680
Millet porridge.

00:19:55.044 --> 00:19:56.177
It's good for the stomach.

00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:57.470
It'll make

00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:58.933
people with a hangover feel better.

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:02.810
Who has a hangover?

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:18.870
How did you know

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:19.730
this works?

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:22.820
Because whenever my uncle got drunk,

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:23.970
my aunt would make this.

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:27.530
Sister, have a seat first.

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:29.200
I'll serve you some porridge.

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:11.090
Did your uncle use to drink a lot?

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:14.920
Did he cause trouble when drunk?

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:21.530
He was fine at home.

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:23.330
At most,

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:24.290
a few arguments.

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:26.530
But sometimes outside,

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:28.050
he'd anger others.

00:21:29.333 --> 00:21:31.222
Then they'd come to settle it at home.

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:36.330
Did they ever bully you?

00:21:42.688 --> 00:21:44.160
What do you do if someone bullies you?

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:46.330
Fight back.

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:51.160
I didn't expect you to be so feisty.

00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:58.190
I've endured it before.

00:21:58.190 --> 00:21:58.880
But...

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:01.770
If you don't fight back,

00:22:01.777 --> 00:22:03.400
it's not just your body that hurts,

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:04.840
but your heart suffers too.

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:20.360
You're back.

00:22:22.177 --> 00:22:23.288
What are you doing here?

00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:24.600
This is still my home.

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:25.970
Why can't I come?

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:40.800
(Preconception Preparation Encyclopedia)

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:50.570
What are you doing?

00:22:57.580 --> 00:22:58.160
Cen Jin.

00:22:58.430 --> 00:22:58.920
Cen Jin.

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:01.840
Stop making a scene.

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:03.360
Don't touch me!

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:13.920
Jin.

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:15.630
Let me explain.

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:16.670
It's not what you think.

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:17.730
Don't call me Jin.

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:19.377
You don't have the right
to call me that.

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:21.680
Give me the phone.

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:23.490
Delete it.

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:24.670
Go away!

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:25.950
Are you crazy?

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:26.880
You're the crazy one!

00:23:28.888 --> 00:23:30.360
I've already contacted the lawyer.

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:31.920
He's already recorded it.

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:33.150
Snatching my phone now

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:34.000
won't change anything.

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:36.177
If you want everyone to see it,
go ahead and try.

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:45.250
Jin...

00:23:46.533 --> 00:23:48.600
We're already preparing
for a divorce agreement.

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:50.490
I swear

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:52.955
I never did anything to betray you

00:23:52.977 --> 00:23:54.600
before our relationship fell apart.

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:55.440
Believe me.

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:57.290
We're not even divorced yet,

00:23:57.688 --> 00:23:59.300
and you've already brought another woman

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:01.133
to live in the marital home I chose.

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:02.440
What do you take me for?

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:04.880
Aren't you
afraid of the legal consequences?

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:08.150
What do you want?

00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:09.688
Didn't you want to talk about divorce?

00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:12.440
Let's go through everything one by one.

00:24:13.266 --> 00:24:14.880
Including the reason for the divorce

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:17.160
and who's at fault.

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:24.120
Yes.

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:27.010
I admit I made mistakes,

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:29.770
but I've done everything I should.

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:31.470
I wanted to save our marriage,

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:32.840
but it couldn't be helped.

00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:35.400
So I want to move forward.

00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:37.050
Move forward?

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:39.970
You sure moved far enough.

00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:42.010
You even have a child now.

00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:45.600
And you still have the nerve
to say that to me?

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:46.810
You...

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:48.600
Don't you have nightmares at night?

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:55.511
Wu Fu. I've been with you
for so many years.

00:24:56.155 --> 00:24:57.260
Only today did I realize

00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:58.640
how fake you really are.

00:24:59.066 --> 00:25:01.010
You're the one
who betrayed our relationship,

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:02.390
yet you still pretend

00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:03.630
you're the victim

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:05.400
and act all righteous,
talking about divorce.

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:07.630
You made me feel

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:09.010
like losing the baby was my fault.

00:25:09.377 --> 00:25:10.749
And then you just stand there,

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:12.822
watching me suffer
and making me reflect.

00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:14.060
Yet you

00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:15.160
already have a child.

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:16.770
Wu Fu.

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:18.600
You're truly shameless.

00:25:32.977 --> 00:25:34.420
(Divorce Agreement)
New agreement.

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:35.777
You walk away empty-handed.

00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:38.530
Or I'll have my lawyer sue you

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:40.730
and ruin your reputation.

00:25:48.333 --> 00:25:50.200
Pay back the previous mortgage payments

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:51.730
for the Pearl River house.

00:25:52.466 --> 00:25:53.711
I'll give up the house.

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:55.810
It's dirty.

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:20.010
Li Wu.

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:23.490
Sister.

00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:27.600
Why are you here instead of home?

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:34.290
I...

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:35.920
Let's go.

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:36.920
Go home.

00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:10.010
Hurry and wash your face.

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:11.120
It's so hot.

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:12.640
Why wait for me outside?

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:22.120
Come here.

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:34.300
(To delete number one,)

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:35.290
(please press one.)

00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:36.640
(To delete all,)

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:38.010
(please press two.)

(Delete user...)

(Enter unlock info.)

00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:55.120
It's done.

00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:58.770
The door code from now on is

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:00.570
160903.

00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:03.010
It's today's date.

00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:04.770
Do you remember it?

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:11.600
I'll be busy the next few days.

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:13.770
If I can't pick you up on weekends,

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:15.440
go home by yourself.

00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:21.680
Okay.

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:26.000
Do you want to try it?

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:40.490
Incorrect password.

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:43.640
Why are you here?

00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:46.770
What?

00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:47.400
Li Wu.

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:48.577
Stop messing around.

00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:03.360
Hello? This is reception.

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:05.920
I'm...

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:09.160
The guest of room 2012.

00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:12.260
I'd like to ask

00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:13.250
who booked

00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:16.600
this room last night?

00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:18.190
Sir, please wait.

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:19.330
We'll check for you.

00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:22.150
It was a woman named Cen Jin

00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:23.400
who booked the room for you.

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:24.870
Speaking of, your friend's ID

00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:25.920
is still at the reception.

00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:29.120
Well...

00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:30.440
Pass it to me.

00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:31.540
Okay.

00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:32.780
I'll have a colleague

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:33.730
bring it up for you.

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:34.970
No need.

00:30:35.355 --> 00:30:36.840
I'll go downstairs and get it myself.

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:41.220
(Cen Jin)

00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:44.290
She brought me here last night?

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:45.150
Sorry.

00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:46.630
I wasn't on duty last night.

00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:47.970
Do you need me to ask for you?

00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:49.290
No, thanks.

00:30:58.430 --> 00:30:58.990
This version

00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:00.190
is Tongchen's

00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:01.360
final draft.

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:02.600
By the way, Jin,

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:04.230
we brainstormed

00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:05.666
Huanyu Technology's creative plan

00:31:05.711 --> 00:31:07.870
and came up with a few new ideas.

00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:09.050
The updated version is synced.

00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:10.300
Okay.

00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:11.330
I'll check it later.

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:13.150
No rush

00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:14.050
on the new project.

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:15.530
You can leave work early today.

00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:17.630
Thanks, Jin.

00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:18.250
Bye.

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:19.290
Bye.

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:26.810
Come in.

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:28.910
Jin, there's a company info change.

00:31:28.910 --> 00:31:30.020
Admin said

00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:30.820
they need your

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:32.470
and Ms. Shen's original ID

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:33.490
and a copy.

00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:34.920
Okay.

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:52.120
Hello.

00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:53.580
Please show your ID.

00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:54.120
Okay.

00:31:54.355 --> 00:31:55.800
Please help me book a room first.

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:57.780
I'll leave my ID here
for registration. I'll pick it up later.

00:31:57.780 --> 00:31:58.250
Okay.

00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:06.330
Wait a moment.

00:32:06.355 --> 00:32:07.666
I'll make a call to check.

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:14.440
Hello?

00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:16.470
I sent someone to the hotel last night

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:18.470
and forgot my ID at the reception.

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:19.580
Could you help me find it?

00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:20.400
My name is Cen Jin.

00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:21.580
Madam, one moment.

00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:22.640
We'll check for you.

00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:24.150
We'll only need one room.

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:26.150
Madam, your ID was taken

00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:27.580
by the guest in room 2012.

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:28.580
He said he's your friend

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:29.530
and will hand it to you.

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:30.390
How could you

00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:31.190
give my ID

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:32.160
to someone else?

00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:33.020
Sorry.

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:34.290
I thought you knew each other.

00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:35.230
The guest said

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:36.020
he would meet you

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:37.020
and pass it to you.

00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:38.050
That's why we...

00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:39.640
I can't contact him directly.

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:40.810
Help me get it back.

00:32:40.977 --> 00:32:43.177
I'll give you an address.
I'll pay when it's delivered.

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:44.490
Okay.

00:32:44.670 --> 00:32:45.533
Really sorry, Ms. Cen.

00:32:45.533 --> 00:32:46.770
We'll contact him immediately.

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:48.640
Okay.

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:06.680
Hello?

00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:08.600
Hello, is this Mr. Li?

00:33:08.910 --> 00:33:09.630
This is

00:33:09.630 --> 00:33:10.810
Wuxing Hotel's reception.

00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:12.540
Ms. Cen Jin wants us

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:14.260
to send her ID.

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:15.540
Could you please provide

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:16.430
your address?

00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:17.666
We'll send someone to pick it up.

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:19.390
You didn't tell her

00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:20.533
I'd deliver it personally?

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:21.390
I did,

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:22.740
but she said

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:24.190
it's inconvenient to contact you

00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:25.680
and wants us to send it.

00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:28.570
Don't bother.

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:30.430
Mr. Li, well...

00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:31.840
I will contact her personally.

00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:33.840
This matter is between us.

00:33:34.866 --> 00:33:36.444
We won't hold the hotel accountable.

00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:40.090
That's all.

00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:56.150
(Your ID is with me.)

00:33:56.150 --> 00:33:57.600
(Come pick it up when you're free.)

00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:08.850
(No need.)

00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:10.200
(Just deliver it to me.)

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:16.280
Sister.

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:18.680
I really

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:21.800
hate you.

00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:37.530

Why are you suddenly resigning?

00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:07.050
Because I'm getting a divorce.

00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:09.200
That's so sudden.

00:40:13.466 --> 00:40:15.620
You don't have a cooling-off period
with your husband.

00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:17.377
You don't have one
with the company either?

00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:19.050

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:22.800

Three days.

You tore that scumbag apart,

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:34.120
made him divorce with nothing,

00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:36.800
and got out of a lousy job.

00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:38.280
