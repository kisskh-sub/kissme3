00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:40.540
You've been working very hard.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.020
Right!

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.500
Come on!

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.820
I love drinking your wine.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.900
All the teams.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.700
Yeah.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.140
Let's stand up.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.940
I feel like…

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:59.740
Right, Mr. Wang?

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.580
Here, let me toast you.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.780
It's mutual.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:07.380
They've

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.900
helped you too.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.340
Where were we?

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.340
You were on the phone for so long.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.940
Sorry.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.100
You're the star of tonight!

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.620
Did I miss anything?

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.900
Well, not really.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.620
Alright, I'll take this one.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.460

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.220

Take it slow.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.380
Take your time. Drink some water.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:45.300
Exactly!

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.660
I'm happy about this big thing.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.660
It's okay.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:59.180
You two...

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.780

It's tasty tonight.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.820
Great.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.860
Of course!

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:09.860
Take your time with the drinks.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:30.940
Although Le doesn't have a mother,

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.260
what he lacks the least

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:35.300
is love.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.180
Even though I've never met my mom,

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.420
I carry her in my mind.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.620
She was the kind of person
who shone brightly.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.340
Have you been happy all these years

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:54.700
without a mom?

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.700
I think I've been pretty happy.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.780
But it's not like I don't have a mom.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.940
She's just

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.340
supporting me in a different way.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.300
I'm used to it.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:08.500
I love her so much.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:10.780
Ms. Wen loves you very much.

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:12.380
She is very good.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.020
Is there something you haven't told me?

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.300
What we had is in the past.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:19.420
It's over.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:16.180

What are you looking at?

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:15.220
Enjoying my photos.

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:16.780
I sent them to you yesterday,

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:17.820
but you didn't say a word.

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:19.620
I'm sorry.

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:20.620
What photos?

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:22.780
Never mind.

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:24.860
You wouldn't say anything nice.

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:26.460
I sent them to Ms. Tan.

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:28.060
And she told me I looked cool.

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:31.220
You sent them to Ms. Tan?

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:32.580
Yes.

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:33.660
I have her phone number.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:37.460
Dad,

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.340
when you get married,

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:41.540
will Ms. Tan come?

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:45.980
Do you want her to come?

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:49.580
You like her?

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:53.380
I wouldn't say it's like.

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:55.300
We're just like-minded.

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:56.700
She's one of my buddies.

00:12:58.700 --> 00:12:59.060
I'll think about it.

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:02.100
Dad!

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:05.820
I've read your article from yesterday.

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:09.060

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:10.380
That's awesome.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:12.540
Something I can brag about for a while.

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:13.540
Where did you read it?

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:14.380
On a phone?

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:16.340
Never mind where I read it.

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:17.660
Listen,

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:19.380
stay low-key.

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:21.220
You're outstanding.

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:22.420
How can I stay low-key?

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.180
How do you know Feng Rui?

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:44.740
You've known each other
for a long time, right?

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:47.780
We were each other's first love.

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:55.260
When I was chatting with her earlier,

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.060
I asked how you met,

00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:58.460
and she said

00:14:58.820 --> 00:14:59.740
you were each other's first love.

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:05.780
I heard Ms. Tan got injured.
Did you know?

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:10.020
Yes. I was there.

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:12.340
Is it serious?

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:14.380
Probably not.

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:15.780
She's already in the hospital.

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:20.100
Ms. Tan.

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:20.700
Where?

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:22.500
The one dancing in the back here.

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:27.020
Is this a collaboration
with the ballet school?

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:29.300
Possibly.

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:30.860
Come on.

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:32.240
Have some fruit.

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:33.140
Try some of this.

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:34.020
Thank you.

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:54.700
Be careful.

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:05.060
Quite a big company.

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:07.340
Located in this area,

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:09.140
the rent must be high.

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:10.500
It's just fine.

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:12.420
I planned to rent two floors,

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:14.340
but the lease for the upper floor
hasn't expired yet,

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:16.100
so I'll make do with this for now.

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:19.860
Making money is important,

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:22.260
but now, for me,

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:25.580
happiness matters most.

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:29.980
For example,

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:32.540
being with you right now.

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:37.900
As the owner

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:39.580
of a big company,

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:42.180
aren't you busy?

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:45.860
Well, a big company.

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.620
A company is like

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:50.780
gears arranged in order.

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:52.060
If I'm not there,

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:52.620
it won't run.

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:54.380
How long can it last then,

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:55.100
right?

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:56.900
But

00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:59.140
if I get busy,

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:01.420
you might not see me for a long time.

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:03.780
That's okay.

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:05.980
If you're very busy,

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:07.180
I can come and help you.

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:08.700
Help me?

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:10.740
How?

00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:12.300
Look,

00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:14.220
while I might not know business,

00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:15.740
I've got good people skills.

00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:18.420
If you've got good people skills,

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:19.580
you'll always have customers.

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:25.820
I didn't notice this about you before.

00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:28.180
Are you interested in doing business?

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:31.540
Yeah.

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:34.540
And I just told you

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:36.260
I love making money the most.

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:40.140
Great!

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:42.100
Then work hard.

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:43.940
Okay, Ms. Zhuang.

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:44.420
I understand.

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:45.860
I'll go back to school right now.

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:47.380
See you in a bit.

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.400
[Tan Siting]

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.720
[Wen Peiyan]

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:21.680
[Cygne, An Excellent Domestic Winery,
Brews Unique Fine Wines]

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:24.380
Sir,

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:26.060
take a look at this form.

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:26.420
Okay.

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:27.380
I'll get back to my work.

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:27.620
Okay.

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:29.620
The quantity you wanted.

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:30.460
Not bad.

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:32.220
It has a sweet aftertaste.

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:34.420
If you think it's fine, let's buy some.

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:36.460
How do you two

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:37.460
find the wine?

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:38.900
This wine is good.

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:39.620
Glad you like it.

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:40.620
It has a lingering aftertaste.

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:42.020
Great.

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:43.420
Well,

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:44.740
if there's no problem,

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:46.420
I'll send it to the address

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:47.300
you provided as usual.

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:47.980
Okay.

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:48.980
Thank you.

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:49.940
Alright, then.

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:50.940
We'll be going now.

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:51.860
We're leaving first.

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:52.300
Wait a moment.

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:52.740
I'll buy two bottles.

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:54.140
We'll taste them later.

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:54.780
Okay.

00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:55.020
Thank you.

00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:55.700
Is this a gift?

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:56.140
Yes.

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:56.700
This is…

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:57.060
Thank you.

00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:57.980
A gift for you.

00:18:58.460 --> 00:18:58.980
Thank you.

00:18:58.980 --> 00:18:59.940
We'll be going now.

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:01.020
Let me see you out.

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:01.980
Okay.

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.380
Thank you. Take care.

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:05.820
Okay.

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:07.260
Ms. Tan.

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:07.980
Is Mr. Feng in?

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:09.060
He's inside.

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:09.980
I need to see him now.

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:12.260
Mr. Feng,

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:13.580
waiting for your order contract.

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:14.260
Okay, ASAP.

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:14.740
Okay.

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:15.180
Feng Rui,

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:16.380
I have something urgent.

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:19.140
Qi, please see the guests out.

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:19.580
Okay.

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:20.780
Mr. Feng, I'll be going now.

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:21.060
Alright.

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:22.020
This way, please.

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:25.540
Who took this photo? Where was it taken?

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:26.900
Look here.

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:27.820
This is my dad.

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:31.660
Where did you find this photo?

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:33.180
Peiyan's Moments.

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:43.260
Duoji.

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:44.580
I...

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:45.940
I have an impression.

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:50.020
When we were distributing

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:52.020
at the winery's office door,

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:54.220
he seemed to come by driving a car.

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:56.700
Can

00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:57.540
you…

00:19:58.060 --> 00:19:59.220
But he didn't say anything.

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:00.380
Just dropped off the stuff and left.

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:00.820
So...

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:02.180
I...

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:03.660
I'll call and ask.

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:04.380
Okay.

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:04.700
Thanks.

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:13.780
Wait, I'll sign and confirm.

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:18.660
Take a look.

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:20.620
Mr. Feng?

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:21.660
Duoji.

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:22.140
Yes.

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:23.580
Let me ask you something.

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:25.780
I just sent you a photo.

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:27.540
I'm looking for

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:28.500
the person in the photo.

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:30.060
Do you remember?

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:30.860
When we were distributing supplies

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:32.420
at the winery,

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:35.380
a middle-aged man drove and helped.

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:37.420
He hardly spoke.

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:39.740
And he left after he put things down.

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:43.900
A middle-aged man?

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:45.860
Kind of remember. Why?

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:47.460
Could you find him?

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:49.060
That person...

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:50.620
I need to contact the station.

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:51.140
Mr. Feng,

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:52.060
I'll call you back later.

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:52.540
Okay.

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:53.020
The sooner, the better.

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:54.100
Alright.

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:55.060
Waiting for your call.

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:55.540
Okay.

00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:58.420
How is it? Can he find him?

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.140
He's helping. Might take some time.

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:02.180
Why

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:04.340
don't you have a seat?

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:05.260
Okay.

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:05.620
Wait a moment.

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:19.940
I'll get you a glass of water.

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:21.220
No need, I'm not thirsty.

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:22.500
Thanks.

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:38.020
He's calling.

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:40.300
Just a second.

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:42.060
Duoji.

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:43.380
Mr. Feng,

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:46.980
that person did do

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:47.940
some transport work for us.

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:51.020
Can you find his contact information?

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:52.900
He didn't leave

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:54.340
any contact details.

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:56.300
Those at the station

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:57.300
don't speak much Chinese,

00:21:57.580 --> 00:21:58.500
so they didn't pay attention.

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:00.900
Is it possible he's still there?

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:03.740
I can't guarantee that.

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:06.100
I'll try to keep an eye out for it.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:07.660
I'll call you if I find out anything.

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:08.580
Okay.

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:09.900
Please help me find him.

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:11.900
Alright. I will.

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:12.820
Okay, thanks.

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:15.460
I knew it wouldn't be so easy.

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:18.620
I want Duoji's current phone number.

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:21.500
I'll go over there now

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:22.500
and contact him.

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:23.100
Now?

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:24.220
Yes, now.

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:25.860
You haven't confirmed anything.

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:26.900
If you go over there now,

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:28.740
you'll search like a headless chicken.

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:30.020
But as they search like this,

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:31.100
what if they overlook him?

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:33.380
I finally got some news about my dad.

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:35.140
Don't worry,
he's sent people to look for him.

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:36.900
Once they find a clue, you can go over.

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:38.460
No. I really...

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:40.260
With just a photo,
I fear they'll miss him!

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:40.580
Because

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:41.940
that's my father!

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:43.140
I'd recognize him at a glance.

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:44.060
Please calm down.

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:47.420
How, Feng Rui?

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:48.940
It's been 12 years.

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:50.740
This isn't about you.

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:55.220
Finally, there's a clue.

00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:57.740
I've had this dream so many times.

00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:58.020
In...

00:22:58.900 --> 00:22:59.500
In my dreams,

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:01.180
I always find my dad.

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:02.020
But in the end?

00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:03.380
Nothing.

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:05.380
Now I've finally got news.

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:06.220
And you tell me to calm down.

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:07.700
Tell me,

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:08.740
how am I supposed to be calm?

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:13.860
I'm sorry.

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:19.060
My apologies.

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:19.700
It's alright.

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:26.260
How is he now?

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:31.340
He...

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:33.180
He's doing very well.

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:38.700
Okay.

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:39.420
Don't worry.

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:52.140
So

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:53.340
your father has been in Hongyuan County,

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:54.620
in Sichuan's Aba Prefecture.

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:55.460
I think so.

00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:59.220
Now we can't get by without a phone.

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:00.820
Let alone contacting people,

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:02.460
even buying things,

00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:04.220
we need our phone to pay.

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:06.340
But the telecom company

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:08.300
can't find his usage history.

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:10.020
So, most likely,

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:12.220
he's in a completely isolated

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:14.220
and self-sufficient environment.

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:15.180
I think so.

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:18.100
So I'd like to ask for some time off.

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:19.660
I'm going to go over there.

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:21.340
Alright.

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:23.580
Decide these things for yourself.

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:25.900
Prepare everything you need

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:26.500
before you set off.

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:27.460
Remember

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:30.540
to let us know
you're safe while traveling.

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:31.420
If anything comes up,

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:33.020
contact me right away.

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:33.900
I know.

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:35.460
Ms. Tan.

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:36.300
Ms. Wei.

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:39.420
Ms. Tan,

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:42.940
I'd like to treat you and Uncle Wang
to dinner tonight.

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:44.980
If he hadn't invited Ms. Dong,

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:46.660
my foot wouldn't have healed
in a short time.

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:48.020
I wanted to thank you.

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:50.700
Sure.

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:53.620
Yufan, can I join you?

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:55.420
I haven't seen Uncle Wang in ages.

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:56.780
Of course.

00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:58.100
And if you hadn't tipped us off,

00:24:58.100 --> 00:24:59.100
he wouldn't have come.

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:00.900
See you tonight.

00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:02.620
Alright.

00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:03.380
This one.

00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:04.620
We're not picking it.

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:05.780
We're picking...

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:08.620
Look, I like this one of Ms. Wen.

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:09.940
How happy her smile is!

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:11.020
I smiled happily,

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:11.580
right?

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:13.220
Pick one of my handsome photos.

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:13.860
You...

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:15.540
So great!

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:16.180
Looks great.

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:17.220
This one of yours is good.

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:18.700
Put this one in the living room.

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:19.260
This one works too.

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:20.620
That won't do.

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:21.660
This one.

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:22.700
You keep thinking about...

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:23.180
You're back.

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:24.780
Mom.

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:25.260
Rui,

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:26.180
welcome back.

00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:27.500
Look.

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:28.420
Which one?

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:29.820
Rui,

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:31.540
come here and choose.

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:33.020
This one's okay.

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:34.940
Is this one good?

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:35.900
I think this one...

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:36.980
Look how your dad's smiling.

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:38.740
It's a bit unnatural.

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:39.540
Right, it's not quite right.

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:40.260
Isn't it?

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:40.660
This one.

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:40.820
Right.

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:42.780
I'm not a huge fan of this one.

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:43.700
Which one do you like?

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:47.300
This one.

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:48.300
This one.

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:50.140
I feel like

00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:50.380
this one.

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:50.780
No.

00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:51.140
This one.

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:52.180
This is the one.

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:53.580
Yes, this one.

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:53.900
This one.

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:55.220
Rui,

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:56.100
look!

00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:57.540
How about

00:25:57.780 --> 00:25:59.140
putting this one in your bedroom?

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:00.940
Mom,

00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:04.100
nobody hangs wedding photos these days.

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:04.940
Thanks.

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:07.620
But Rui is right.

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:08.180
Nowadays,

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:09.940
it's not that popular anymore.

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:12.140
I like hanging things on the wall!

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:14.500
Pick one of my coolest

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:15.380
and biggest photos

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:16.980
and hang it up in the living room.

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:18.700
So as soon as any guest comes in,

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:19.980
they'll see me first.

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:21.180
Alright.

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:21.740
Let's

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:24.220
hang your photo on the wall, okay?

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:24.660
Okay.

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:26.420
We've got to pick one.

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:28.060
If we must do it.

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:28.820
This one, then.

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:29.300
It's settled.

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:31.940
How's that?

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:32.900
I think it works.

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:33.340
Not bad.

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:35.460
Yan,

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:37.500
are you free on Friday?

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:38.980
Nothing much is going on.

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:40.380
Rui,

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:41.540
are you free

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:42.780
on Friday?

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:44.340
On Friday?

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:45.580
I think so.

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:48.020
Good.

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:48.540
It's settled then.

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:49.740
I had someone look it up.

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:51.940
That day is auspicious.

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:53.940
Go register your marriage.

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:56.220
How about it, Yan?

00:26:58.420 --> 00:26:58.740
Sure.

00:26:59.140 --> 00:26:59.420
Rui?

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:01.700
Mom.

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:02.260
Alright.

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:03.740
It's decided.

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:06.060
Great.

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:39.500
It's so beautiful.

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:41.660
The girl dancing ballet on it

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:43.020
is just like Yufan.

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:44.140
She's also Ms. Tan.

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:45.540
She's also you,

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:48.020
and all the girls who love ballet.

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:50.260
Thank you for the gift.

00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:52.420
If you hadn't invited Dr. Dong,

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:54.500
I might not have been able to
make it to the match.

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:55.660
You're too kind.

00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:57.820
Everything happens for the best.

00:27:58.620 --> 00:27:59.900
Like Ms. Tan,

00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:01.140
you were born

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:02.500
to be a ballerina.

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:04.940
So continue to strive and do better.

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:07.220
I look forward
to your greater achievements.

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:09.740
Ms. Tan is my role model.

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:11.980
Keep working hard.

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:14.780
Yufan, I'll learn from you.

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:18.420
Choosing ballet, you must persevere

00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:19.460
and keep going,

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:20.020
understand?

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:22.340
How have you been lately?

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:24.140
As the competition is over,

00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:25.820
things should be more relaxed.

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:29.140
I'm going to Hongyuan County

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:30.980
in Sichuan's Aba Prefecture.

00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:34.060
I asked Ms. Zhuang for leave today.

00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:34.860
Ms. Tan,

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:36.100
why are you going there?

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:39.020
Is it about your dad?

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:39.780
Yes,

00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:41.620
someone saw him there.

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:43.020
So, I must rush there.

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:45.180
Is that person reliable?

00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:46.220
Yes.

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:48.740
It's the vineyard

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:50.380
of Feng Rui's winery.

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:52.020
My dad was there days ago.

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:54.380
When are you going?

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:54.860
Tomorrow.

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:55.980
So soon?

00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:58.380
I got the news today.

00:28:58.380 --> 00:28:59.980
I'm worried that if I'm late,

00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:01.220
I'll miss him again.

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:02.820
Are you going alone?

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:03.860
Yes.

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:04.820
Don't worry.

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:05.980
I'll be fine on my own.

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:07.860
Ms. Tan,

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:09.220
if you're going there,

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:11.300
help take some throat lozenges
to Old Sir.

00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:12.900
He caught a chill

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:15.420
from staying up all night.

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:17.340
After coming here,

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:19.380
I found some throat lozenges

00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:21.980
and planned to take them to him
in the summer,

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:24.020
but since you're going,

00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:25.660
could you please take them to him now?

00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:26.900
Sure.

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:28.900
Ms. Tan, if you're going there,

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:30.380
how will you deal with the language barrier?

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:31.900
It's okay.

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:33.580
When I went there before,

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:34.940
I met a local friend.

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:36.460
He can be my guide

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:37.620
and help with translation.

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:39.740
That's good.

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:41.140
Ms. Tan,

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:43.300
we're seeing you off today.

00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:44.660
We wish you

00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:46.420
a safe journey tomorrow.

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:47.340
Thank you.

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:48.180
Hope you'll find your dad soon.

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:02.260
Alright,

00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:03.940
I'm done.

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:06.460
Me too.

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:07.500
Take your time eating.

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:09.020
Wait. I'll take care of it.

00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:10.460
Whoever finishes last washes the dishes.

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:14.740
Alright.

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:15.940
Eat slowly.

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:17.140
Eat slowly.

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:18.820
I was teasing you.

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:23.780
Leave it there.

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:24.580
I'll put it right here.

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:28.300
Have some vegetables.

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:33.540
Peiyan, are you free later?

00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:35.660
Let's go out for a bit.

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:42.300
Let me finish this.

00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:44.780
Yan,

00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:46.100
go on out.

00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:46.900
I'll clean up.

00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:47.580
Just leave it there.

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:49.420
Okay.

00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:53.820
Go ahead.

00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:48.180
Peiyan…

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:49.180
Do you know?

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:52.900
Le has made great progress
in his studies lately.

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:54.620
Seems your mom is right

00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:56.500
not to send him to the training center.

00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:58.500
He's about to start middle school soon,

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:00.060
so he can put aside

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:01.540
the piano for a while.

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:03.300
But

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:05.340
he's a bit unhappy

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:07.180
because he couldn't play with his Legos.

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:08.460
But he can play

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:10.700
with them again after some time.

00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:17.700
You've been very busy lately.

00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:21.020
We should thank

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:23.220
Ms. Lin.

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:26.380
Because of her wonderful articles,

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:28.980
Cygne is known to more people.

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:31.660
Have you got a lot of orders recently?

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:33.820
Yes.

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:37.060
We've had more orders than before.

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:46.380
Le and I made a bet.

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:48.780
I found a cake shop

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:50.900
with incredibly delicious cakes.

00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:52.340
One of the cakes

00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:55.220
without cream is amazing.

00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:56.740
Le said you don't like it,

00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:58.500
but I said you do.

00:32:58.500 --> 00:32:59.100
If there's a chance...

00:32:59.100 --> 00:32:59.740
Peiyan,

00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:01.980
actually...

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:04.060
We should break up.

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:16.100
We've known each other

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:18.900
for four or five years now.

00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:22.300
So many times,

00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:24.260
I've wondered

00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:25.380
what

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:27.020
our relationship is.

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:30.260
Am I Le's teacher,

00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:32.940
your normal friend,

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:35.980
or a soulmate?

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:40.740
But why even try to figure it all out?

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:41.700
Actually,

00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:44.900
as long as I'm by your side

00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:46.780
and taking good care of Le,

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:50.140
I feel quite happy.

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:56.740
When you agreed in the car

00:33:57.940 --> 00:33:59.180
that day to give us a try,

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:01.980
I really didn't expect that.

00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:07.860
And during this time

00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:09.980
of preparing for the wedding,

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:14.260
it's been my happiest moment.

00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:20.940
But I can sense

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:23.900
that you're unhappy,

00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:24.980
right?

00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:28.860
So, I've been thinking,

00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:30.780
if it weren't for Le,

00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:32.260
would we

00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:35.700
even be at this point?

00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:46.180
That person is Tan Siting, right?

00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:57.940
She's Le's real mother.

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:10.580
Sometimes, a woman's intuition

00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:13.180
is terrifyingly accurate.

00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:16.180
No wonder

00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:18.660
every time I look into Le's eyes,

00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:20.700
I always feel like

00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:23.540
I can see her shadow.

00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:31.180
I

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:32.980
don't want

00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:35.020
to keep deceiving you,

00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:37.380
or deceiving myself.

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:38.900
It's unfair to you.

00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:41.660
I don't want to continue this mistake.

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:52.500
So, before the invitations are sent out,

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:53.980
it's not too late for everything.

00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:55.820
We can cut our losses in time.

00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:07.740
I feel like a weight has been lifted.

00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:10.740
Don't worry,

00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:13.460
we're adults.

00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:16.580
Nobody will die without someone else.

00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:18.460
It's been a long time

00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:19.660
since I've taken a break.

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:21.660
I want to give myself

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:23.740
a short vacation.

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:26.340
Ms. Wei has been asking me for a while.

00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:34.940
Thank you.

00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:38.420
Even though I know

00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:40.500
you don't like it when I thank you,

00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:45.300
I do want to thank you.

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:49.980
And every time I've thanked you,

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:51.820
it was from the bottom of my heart.

00:37:58.900 --> 00:37:59.340
Thank you.

00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:09.300
The breeze here feels so nice.

00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:12.180
I want to be alone for a little while.

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:13.620
You can go ahead.

00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:17.540
I'll stay here with you.

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:21.540
Give me some space.

00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:23.220
Besides, if you go back late,

00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:26.980
your mom and Le will worry about you.

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:28.420
Please, go.

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:37.460
Hurry!

00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:42.420
Hello.

00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:49.500
I thought I told you what to do.

00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:52.180
About this,

00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:53.940
go to Mr. Tang.

00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:07.340
Tomorrow, I'm heading somewhere far.

00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:13.260
For work?

00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:20.180
To find someone.

00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:24.260
Will you come back?

00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:33.300
Of course, I'll be back.

00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:38.940
Will you be gone for long?

00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:40.660
What about my dad's wedding?

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:41.980
You won't miss it, will you?

00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:50.580
Seems I'll have to miss it.

00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:00.380
But I'll bring you a gift
when I get back.

00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:03.940
Well, take care.

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:04.660
Come back soon.

00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:09.940
Okay.

00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:11.940
Let's meet when I'm back.

00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:14.100
Alright.

00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:14.660
See you then.

00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:57.380
The latest version of this game

00:41:57.420 --> 00:41:58.460
has been sent to your email.

00:41:58.500 --> 00:41:59.940
Please check if changes are needed.

00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:01.260
I'll communicate with the team.

00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:02.700
Okay, that's all.
