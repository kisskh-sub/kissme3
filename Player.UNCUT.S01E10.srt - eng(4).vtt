00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.360
- (Previously on "Player")
- Goodbye, Ploy.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.000
How about finding someone new?

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.880
I ran into Bee the other day.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.640
But last time, she really did a number on Pun.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.640
You’ve really changed.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.080
Wanna come to the restroom with me?

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.080
I’m just bored.
I wanted to find something to do about it.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.120
Ploy.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.800
Getting with someone else
just to forget another.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.400
No matter how much you try to fill it,
it’ll never be enough.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.200
Kiss me now.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.960
I feel like
I’m being used right now.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.840
I just want you to be clear about it.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.840
Leaving things like this only hurts both of you.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.680
I know you got close to me
to find out about Phetai.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.520
I just wanted you to know

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.720
that I love you, Ploy.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.960
What we had was never real.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.400
It was never real from the start.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.080
I’ve had enough of being betrayed.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.000
(2 months later)

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.160
"Nice pick."

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.680
"This is my all-time favourite."

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.440
"I’m not free yet."

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.000
"Well, you didn’t show up that day."

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.200
“Is it the same again?”

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.440
“If it is, I think we’ve already talked about this.”

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.200
Let me think about it again

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.640
whether I can meet you or not.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.280
So, which girl have you caused trouble with this time?

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.440
There’s some girl from New York looking for you.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.039
Her name’s Pun.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.960
That’s it.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.920
♫ You act so calm and cool
as you’re stepping close to me ♫

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.600
♫ You come around so endlessly,
I know what’s on your mind, you see ♫

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.120
♫ You play it off each time our eyes collide ♫

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.000
♫ But your gaze betrays the truth you try to hide ♫

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.320
♫ The closer we become ♫

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.480
♫ The more my heart’s undone ♫

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.480
♫ It trembles more each time we meet as one ♫

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.079
♫ Game for your love ♫

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.760
♫ But I’m a pro player, baby ♫

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.880
♫ I wish you’d slip and show your heart to me ♫

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.200
♫ But somehow, I can always see it clearly ♫

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:08.480
♫ I try so hard to hold my heart inside
But in the end, I can’t stop loving you so right ♫

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.960
♫ Game Over ♫

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.320
“Thanks, Ploy.”

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.880
"I’ll pay you back as soon as I can."

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.560
And don’t forget what I asked for, alright?

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.720
Mm, sure. That’s easy.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.880
Uh… Ploy…

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.240
"Why"

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.160
do you have to make this so complicated?

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.079
"I…"

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.520
"I just don’t get why you want me to…"

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.600
"lie to Pun"

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.920
"about the day I’m supposed to pay it back."

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.800
Something urgent came up.
I have to go.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.440
Are you outside?

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.480
Wherever you are, Pun’s on her way to you.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.480
How I know doesn’t matter.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.800
But you should tell me now

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.800
what’s really going on between you and her.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.960
Then just give her the money back.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.279
End it clean. I’ll transfer it to you.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.519
But I need one thing from you

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.640
You have to pay Pun back

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.800
on the exact day and time I tell you.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.120
"What do you want to eat in Hong Kong?"

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.440
Anything’s fine.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:32.720
Oh, wait a sec.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.360
“Hello? Pun, right?”

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.880
Who's this?

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.760
“Your soon-to-be husband, of course.”

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.480
Phetai?

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.360
"Why do you want me to stall Pun?"

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.600
What are you thinking, Ploy? Can you just tell me?

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.960
It’s none of your business.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:55.760
Ploy.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.280
Come on, I know how you feel about her.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.400
I just don’t get why you have to make it such a mess.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.520
"If you knew from the start,
why didn’t you just talk it out and sort it then?"

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.520
"Two of you wouldn’t be fighting like this now."

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.120
No matter what, it was always going to end like this.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.320
Ploy.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.120
If this is how you see it,

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.680
why didn’t you just end it
when you knew Pun was digging into things?

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.560
What were you waiting for?

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:26.720
That’s it.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.440
"Head straight to the studio after this, Jay."

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.640
You’ve got an interview at five.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:48.960
Pass me the lipstick, please.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.760
So what’s happening with the wedding?

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.600
Given up on it?

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.680
No, not at all.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.560
These past two months,
Prang and I have been really busy.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.600
And she’s stressed about Pun too.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.440
If I ask her now, it’ll just kill the mood.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.320
But honestly, if you asked her,

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.120
it might even make her feel better.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.560
I don’t want to risk it.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.800
Feeling a bit hurt, are you?

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.360
I get it.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.480
Prang’s busy and stressed.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.320
Pun’s situation matters too.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.360
But every day I go home
I barely talk to her.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.200
Every time I ask how she is.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.680
She doesn’t want to talk to me.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.240
She says talking will just drag her down.

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:48.720
So what am I supposed to do?

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.240
Take it easy.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.480
Take it easy.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.400
I worry about her, you know.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.440
A lot.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.840
But I’m tired too.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.000
Thank you.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.720
If Pun has any problems,

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.560
please let me know.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:20.600
Thank you.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.240
Phe?

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.159
Mm.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.240
She still hasn’t called back?

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.400
Not yet.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.240
Prang, I think you should give Pun some space.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.400
Let her breathe a bit.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.320
Once she’s got her head straight, she’ll call you.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.680
But it’s been a few months, Jay.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.320
I know you’re worried about her.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.520
But she’s not a kid anymore.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.160
You’ve got to let go.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.800
I just want to talk to Pun
and sort things out. That’s all.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.120
But she’s not ready to talk, Prang.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.320
Try seeing it from her side.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.680
She just doesn’t want you
to be disappointed about the money.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.760
The more you push,
the more you’ll drive her away.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.440
It’s not about the million baht at all, Jay.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:44.080
Okay, Prang.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.160
You really don’t understand me.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.560
I’m sorry then.

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.080
Wait.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:13.400
What’s wrong?

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.520
I’m going to the gym.

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:19.640
Jay.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.320
Jay!

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.400
"Chatr, my love…"

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.080
Did you know sometimes even flowers have a heart?

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:43.760
A flower

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.920
that can only stay still,

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.520
never getting close to anyone,

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.520
using nothing but its own scent

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.720
to lure in passing insects.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.640
And one day,

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.640
when that flower meets a butterfly

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.440
that comes to sip its nectar,

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.880
the flower doesn’t think much of it.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.040
It simply assumes

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.800
it’s just another creature dropping by.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.240
But why is it…

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.960
why is it that when that butterfly flies away

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.160
and never comes back,

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.560
the flower...

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.520
suddenly finds itself missing it?

00:10:58.760 --> 00:10:59.960
Maybe

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:04.240
it was enchanted by its beauty

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.880
no other butterfly could match.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.760
But by the time the flower realizes that…

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:25.640
that butterfly

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.960
has already flown away for good.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.600
This little flower

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.560
misses that butterfly so terribly.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.480
Misses it so much

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.920
its petals have started to wilt

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.840
and no one comes near it anymore.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.120
- Ploy! Ploy!
- Ploy!

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.800
- Ploy! Ploy!
- Ploy!

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.240
Please! Help her.
Someone grab an inhaler. Quick!

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.800
- The inhaler. Hurry! Ploy!
- Miss Ploy? Miss Ploy!

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.320
Ploy. Are you alright?

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.920
(”The Deviana”)

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.480
"Ploy. Please tell me I’m wrong about this."

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.080
"Lucky me,"

00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.880
I saw your story today, Ploy.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.200
Otherwise I’d have missed all the fun.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.520
Why is it so tense today?

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.000
Who made you so mad?

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.240
Why did you stop?

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.920
Just go, Pinky. I’m not in the mood.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.240
- Huh?
- Just go.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.800
What the…

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:10.280
(”Dream: I’ve just arrived in Hong Kong.
See you soon.”)

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:44.640
How are you feeling?

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:53.400
Better now.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:55.640
Thanks.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.480
I brought you some rice porridge.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.400
Do you want to eat now?

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:03.960
I’ll eat it myself.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.200
You can head back, Prang.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.400
Have you spoken to Pun at all?

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.320
There’s nothing to talk about.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:25.000
But you still ask Phe about her.

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.640
I talk to Phe too, you know.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.280
I’m sorry, okay?

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:39.480
For dragging you into this mess.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.400
I’m not sure I’m the one

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.120
you should apologize to.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:54.320
Then who?

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:57.080
Pun?

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.440
The one who lied to me,

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.200
used me over and over for months.

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.280
As bad as each other.

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.880
You lied to Pun too, didn’t you?

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:22.120
Stop acting like the victim.

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.280
If you weren’t like this right now,

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.600
I’d probably slap you.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.040
Go on then. Don’t hold back.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.400
This is from me as Pun’s sister.

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:02.120
And this

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.319
is from me as someone who sees you as family.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.040
You’ve never been like this before.
Do you realize that?

00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:21.680
Not just now,

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:23.599
but all this time.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.480
Normally, if someone tried to
take advantage of you,

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:32.200
you’d cut them off straight away.

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.400
So why now?

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:37.240
Why?

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:42.280
Why have you let the whole thing
with Pun drag on this long?

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:46.360
I haven’t ‘let’ anything.

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:48.960
It’s like you’ve once said.

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:54.080
If someone plays games with you, you play back.

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.360
If she takes advantage, I get even.

00:17:58.720 --> 00:17:59.920
It’s fun, isn’t it?

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.520
Why put yourself through this, Ploy?

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:29.960
Doesn’t it hurt?

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.120
You okay, Prang?

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:14.080
I’m okay.

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.160
(”Pun”)

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.360
Don’t call her.

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:32.400
Are you really not going to talk to me?

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:36.720
What, Jay?

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:40.080
The other day you wouldn’t even talk to me.

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:51.640
I get it.

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:53.840
You’re stressed about Pun.

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.760
But it’s been over a month now.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.920
When are you going to be yourself again?

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.280
Do you even realize

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:05.640
we barely spend time together?
Even when we’re together, we hardly talk.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.120
I want to help you, Prang.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.840
But you won’t let me in.

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:21.680
I’m tired.

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:32.880
I feel like

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.600
I’m on the outside.

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:47.880
I’m sorry.

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:53.000
I didn’t mean to make you feel that way.

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.600
I’m sorry for not thinking it through

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.720
and forgot about how you felt.

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:15.440
You’re free this Saturday, right?

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:20.760
Then, shall we go out?

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.280
My treat.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:25.760
Where?

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:30.400
Smile first, then I’ll tell you.

00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.240
(”Best”)

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:09.640
Yes?

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:11.480
"Ploy…"

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.880
Pun is really taking it hard.

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.280
Do you really feel nothing for her?

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:23.000
"Shame, really. I’ve been rooting for you."

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:27.080
But anyway, just giving you a heads-up.

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:30.240
Pun’s meeting up with Bee today.

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.320
She’s her first kiss.

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:37.000
"If you’re starting to cave,
you can always come take a look."

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:11.800
Two, please.

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.040
Took you long enough, Ploy.

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.080
They’re already in the bathroom together.

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:32.200
I’m here to have a drink,
not because of Pun.

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:35.560
You can see I’m with someone.

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.680
Obviously, you’re trying to make her jealous.

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:44.240
Are you going after them?

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:47.120
And is she drunk?

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:50.360
Pun? I don’t think so.

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:54.080
Then she knows exactly what she’s doing.

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:48.160
Ploy?

00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.560
Yes? What is it?

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:03.360
About that night,

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.360
Nothing happened between Pun and me.

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:10.760
I don’t need to know.

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:13.120
But thanks for telling me.

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:19.760
If you can’t let it go,
why not talk to her first?

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:22.000
This has nothing to do with you.

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:24.880
It does, actually.

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:28.880
I was dragged into this to make you jealous.

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:30.600
Sure.

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:32.560
I can tell.

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.240
Are you finished?

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:36.720
Then may I…

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.400
If you can see it that clearly,

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:41.200
then you already know

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.720
that she loves you, don’t you?

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:53.320
That girl, she’s really been through it.

00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:58.360
I hurt her once too, you know.

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:01.520
Thought she’d sworn off love after that.

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:08.400
I’ve no idea what you two argued about

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.120
but from what I can see,

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:15.680
you both still care.

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:19.560
There’s no point staying angry.

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:21.960
You’ll only hurt yourselves.

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:26.440
That’s all I wanted to say.

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:30.680
Good luck.

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:54.400
"Why put yourself through this, Ploy?"

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.000
"Doesn’t it hurt?"

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:36.360
Best,

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.680
can you check something for me?

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.400
Make sure Pun gets back safely.

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.040
"I’m sorry."

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.360
"Get out."

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:55.600
I’ve had enough of being betrayed.

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:06.600
(”Pun’s hug”)

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:09.920
"This bottle will be one of a kind."

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:12.280
When you wear this one,

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:15.720
you’ll see my aura,

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:17.760
hugging you tight.

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:28.520
It’ll fade away.

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:32.360
It’ll fade away.

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:35.600
It’ll fade away.

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:52.480
It’ll fade away.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.120
It’ll fade away.

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:04.040
It’ll fade away, eventually.

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:08.800
It’ll fade away, eventually.

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:36.320
"Wow!"

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:39.600
You booked out the whole cinema?

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:42.560
It’s been ages since we spent time like this.

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.640
Just being with you,

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:49.400
that’s enough to make me happy.

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.640
And honestly, I thought

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:56.160
you might’ve forgotten about me.

00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:58.040
I’m sorry.

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:01.400
that I made you feel that way.

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:07.920
I want to be someone you can rely on, Prang.

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:10.240
I want to be by your side.

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:13.840
Well…

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:17.640
There's something I want to tell you.

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:21.000
Before this, I tried…

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:21.800
(phone vibrating)

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:22.880
Wait…

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:25.920
Hello?

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:30.080
Oh, sure. I’ll call you back.
One moment.

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:31.200
Okay.

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:34.680
What happened?

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:36.400
Urgent work.

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:37.840
Well,

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:40.680
I need to take this for a bit. I’ll be quick.

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:43.080
Can’t your manager handle it?

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:45.320
Not this one. I have to do it myself.

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:47.760
I won’t be long. Please wait for me?

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:50.080
Prang…

00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:58.640
(sighs)

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:01.320
You said we’d spend time together.

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:23.080
You like surprises, don’t you?

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:34.120
Jay.

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:35.360
Jay!

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:38.880
(phone ringing)

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:43.640
Yes, Jae Ang.

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:45.600
Yeah,

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:47.520
Jay’s here.

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:37.200
"She’s been planning this since sports day?"

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:39.800
I had no idea.

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:41.200
Yeah.

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:43.160
But it fell apart every single time.

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:44.360
(sighs)

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:50.080
Jae Ang,

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:53.480
I think I need your help.

00:34:10.199 --> 00:34:11.440
Will you marry me?

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:12.040
We almost didn’t make it here.

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:18.200
I’m really sorry, Prang.

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:21.360
For everything.

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.040
And thank you so much.

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:29.360
I wouldn’t become who I am without you.

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:34.280
I’m sorry too.

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:38.560
For not giving you enough attention before.

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:46.280
I’ll do better I promise.

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:57.840
I love you so much, Prang.

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:01.840
And I love you just as much.

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:45.760
Ready to go to the honeymoon suite?

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:50.560
We’re not even married yet.

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:53.120
It’s the twenty-first century.

00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:54.680
No one cares.

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:57.320
Shall we?

00:36:59.040 --> 00:36:59.800
Alright.

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:11.520
Why bring me back to school?

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:16.400
Do you remember this spot, Ploy?

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:19.520
It’s where we first met.

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:24.720
What is it?

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:32.480
You disappeared after Hong Kong.

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:35.880
Because there’s nothing left to talk about.

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:38.320
Ploy.

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:45.320
What do you want?

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:50.560
You.

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:54.640
Don’t you miss me at all?

00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:58.760
It’s over, Dream.

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:01.880
It really is.

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:04.520
And I never missed you. Not once.

00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:12.440
So everything you did

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:15.000
being sweet one moment and cold the next,

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:17.160
acting like you cared about me,
then shutting me out.

00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:22.360
All of that was just to see
how Pun really felt, right?

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:24.800
Right?

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:31.120
Thought so.

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:35.400
Heard it didn’t end well, though.

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:38.680
That’s none of your business.

00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:42.840
Did she scam you or something?

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:45.800
What rubbish. Who told you that?

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:48.800
No one. Just saying.

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:50.120
Then stop saying it.

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:58.280
You getting angry

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:01.760
means it’s true, isn’t it?

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:05.880
I’m leaving.

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:12.760
Ploy.

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:15.480
Please give me another chance.

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:19.680
That girl wasn’t serious about you anyway.

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:23.280
The only one who really loves you

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:26.400
who’s stayed true to you is me.

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:35.360
Don’t talk to me about sincerity.

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:37.320
You’re the one who taught me,

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:40.280
you were the first person to show me

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:42.480
that no one in this world is truly sincere.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.960
And it’s always the person you trust most

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:50.400
who lies and betrays me

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.600
to get what they want.

00:39:58.240 --> 00:39:59.120
Ploy.

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:03.640
Ploy.

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:07.720
I’m sorry.

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:10.440
I never meant

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:14.600
to hurt you like this.

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:20.800
I forgive you, Dream.

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:24.680
But let’s not see each other again.

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:29.360
Ploy.

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:30.920
Ploy.

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:49.000
I still can’t believe she set up
a surprise like that.

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:51.600
I was shocked, nearly died.

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:54.320
Congrats.

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:55.760
Both of you.

00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:57.640
Thank you, Ploy.

00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:01.200
Come on. I didn’t even do anything.

00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:04.600
Ahem. Since we’re here already.

00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:07.920
Give us a blessing, Ploy.
Blow on our heads or something.

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:09.160
Oh, stop.

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:12.200
I’m not that old to be giving
wedding blessings, okay?

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:13.480
What?

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:15.000
Come on, Ploy.

00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:16.720
You’ve been a third wheel…

00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:22.080
supporting us the whole way.

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:23.800
Come on, give us a blessing.

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:25.600
Alright.

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:28.440
I wish the two of you

00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:32.960
all the love in the world.

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:36.240
May you stand by each other
through every moment of life.

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:38.920
And even if you’re apart,

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:43.000
may your hearts always remember
the love you share.

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:46.800
May you always be each other’s blessing.

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:50.760
Sathu!

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:52.680
Should we give her a slap?

00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:55.080
Yes, please. She’s been annoying me for ages.

00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:58.360
Hey, you just proposed to me, remember?

00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:10.400
How are you, Ploy?

00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:17.560
I’m alright.

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:22.120
You’re really not going to talk to Pun?

00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:30.640
I though I’ve already
talked to Prang about this.

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:33.000
Ploy…

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:34.640
Enough.

00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:36.560
It’s over.

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:39.880
But sometimes, when something’s over,

00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:42.000
it isn’t really the end.

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:44.440
Pun may have been wrong,

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:47.000
but as her sister,

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:48.920
I can see it

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:52.040
when she really loves something

00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:54.000
whether it’s art,

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:55.360
work,

00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:58.200
or a person.

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:01.440
I believe that

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:04.160
her love for you was real.

00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:08.040
So do I.

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:11.600
I don’t know

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:14.320
what real even means anymore.

00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:17.920
If you’re angry about what happened,

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:22.200
I don’t think Pun ever meant
to lie to you all the way through.

00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:26.520
Honestly, things got out of hand

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:29.080
because

00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:30.920
Pun’s stupid.

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:33.600
Well, it’s true.

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:37.240
When people are in love, everyone’s acts stupid.

00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:39.920
You’re stupid. Pun’s stupid.

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:41.640
Prang and I are stupid as well.

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:43.920
No one makes the right choices in love.

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:46.080
Exactly, like you.

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:49.360
Planning a proposal three, four times

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:50.640
and failing every time.

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:52.760
- Yes.
- That’s also... stupid.

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:55.680
How did we get here?

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:01.720
I...

00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:05.680
I want you to just try talking to her again.

00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:12.680
We all want to see you happy.

00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:15.760
So do I.

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:46.040
"The two people who deserve love
the most right now"

00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:49.640
are you and Pun.

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:56.120
"I really want both of you to be happy."

00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:11.040
Luckily, it hasn’t gone off yet.

00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:52.600
Pour the water and receive the blessing.

00:45:54.360 --> 00:46:05.280

(”Pailin Priyakorn”)

00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:08.680
Pailin.

00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:12.120
I miss you so much.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.280
Why don’t you ever come to me in my dreams?

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:18.080
Come visit me just once.

00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:22.560
Since you’ve been gone,

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:27.000
every day of my life

00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:30.480
feels empty and meaningless.

00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:34.360
I miss you so much it hurts.

00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:38.200
One day

00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:41.440
we’ll see each other again.

00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:46.560
Wait for me a little longer, Pailin.

00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:03.040
Mom, please don’t say things like that.

00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:05.440
Say what?

00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:09.520
Don’t say your life has no meaning.

00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:11.560
Or that you want to go be with her.

00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:15.640
And what would you know about how I feel?

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:17.320
What would you know

00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:20.200
about what it’s like for a mother to lose a child?

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:22.840
I don’t know.

00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:27.720
But please don’t say things like that in front of Uncle Chai.

00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:29.600
Why not?

00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:31.360
Who are you

00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:35.000
to tell me what I can or can’t say?

00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:39.720
You have Uncle Chai beside you.

00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:41.920
You still have Phe.

00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:44.120
- And you still have me…
- Because of you.

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.640
Because of you, isn’t it?
Pailin isn’t here because of you.

00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:55.560
Because of you.

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:02.560
Should I be the one who died instead?

00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:08.320
If the one who died is me,

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:11.600
things would have been better, right?

00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:14.880
How dare you speak to me like that!

00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:18.160
Ploy, come back here!

00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:21.840
For what?

00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:27.800
Or do you want me to die
right here in front of you?

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:29.960
Would that make you happy?

00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:33.360
Do you want me to die right here in front of you?

00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:34.280
Should I, then?

00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:35.000
Don’t.

00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:53.920
If I died,

00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:58.080
you wouldn’t be waiting for me to visit your dreams.

00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:02.680
You wouldn’t be waiting for the day you join me.

00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:10.480
If I died,

00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:14.480
you’d be glad, wouldn’t you?

00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:16.560
Glad to hear it

00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:19.320
that the stain on your life

00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:21.440
has finally faded.

00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:35.680
Someone once told me

00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:39.560
that I deserved to be loved.

00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:46.920
I wanted so badly to believe that, Mom.

00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:50.360
But I never could.

00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:54.400
Because I’ve never felt that love.

00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:58.040
Not even from the person I wanted it from the most.

00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:01.240
Not once.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:06.400
So I keep asking myself.

00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:12.320
Do I not deserve love, Mom?

00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:17.080
Do I not deserve to be happy?

00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:23.520
And if my life is really that worthless,

00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:26.280
maybe I should have died instead.

00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:28.560
Stop it right now, Ploy!

00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:33.080
"Everything’s going well."

00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:34.880
"My work"

00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:37.640
"is finally starting to earn me something."

00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:40.880
"And so is my artistic spirit."

00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:43.120
"The museums…"

00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:46.480
"the vintage flea market on 23rd Street…"

00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:48.720
"the musicians on the rooftop,"

00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:51.120
"playing songs I’m familiar with."

00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:52.640
"the galleries…"

00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:55.040
"Everything fills my mind"

00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:56.400
"and my imagination."

00:55:56.800 --> 00:56:00.320
"And my heart is in a place where I finally belong."

00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:03.120
"It’s a place where ideas bloom endlessly."

00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:15.160
"As for Phe…"

00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:17.040
"after coming back to New York,"

00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:19.160
"he quit gambling for good,"

00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:22.480
"paid to have the front door rebuilt,
stronger than before,"

00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:25.880
"and started taking his work
at his restaurant, seriously."

00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:27.800
What are you doing, Phe?

00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:34.480
Did you have to ruin the whole set?

00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:39.720
Well, I had to defend myself at that moment.

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:47.520
Other than paying off the debts,

00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:50.960
I’ve got to start over collecting all this stuff too.

00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:56.160
You didn’t have to buy everything new.

00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:57.880
You could’ve fixed them.

00:56:58.360 --> 00:56:59.000
Look.

00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:00.960
Glue it back together and it’s fine.

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:03.840
Maybe.

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:06.040
Some things

00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:07.920
can be fixed, maybe.

00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:29.600
Uno.

00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:30.680
Game.

00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:32.480
"At first, it was lonely."

00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:35.400
"But I was lucky to have Jeong-Ah and Angie,"

00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:37.480
"who helped me with so many things,"

00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:40.840
"and became the people
I spent most of my time with."

00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:44.160
"To be honest, they made me miss
Jieab and the others too."

00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:48.400
So…

00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:49.760
How was your work?

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:51.400
It’s pretty good, actually.

00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:53.480
And I really enjoyed it here.

00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:55.760
Oh!

00:57:57.320 --> 00:57:58.320
Just a moment, okay?

00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:02.880
"Catherine, she’s a lecturer at the university."

00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:07.240
"She’s been helping me
ever since I first started my master’s."

00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:09.240
"After that,"

00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:12.400
"she pretty much became my mentor."

00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:16.000
"She’s the one who offered me that job before,"

00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:17.760
"the one I turned down."

00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:19.880
"Luckily, when I came back,"

00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:23.160
"Catherine still helped pull strings for me
to get the position again."

00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:25.800
"My life is finally falling into place."

00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:28.920
Umm, sorry.

00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:30.080
It’s okay.

00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:34.160
Our university is sending alumni back
to their home countries

00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:36.480
to speak at an education fair

00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:38.480
and promote the school.

00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:41.640
And actually, I think you're
going to be perfect for that.

00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:43.360
What do you think?

00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:46.120
So…

00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:48.240
You’re saying that

00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:50.360
I have to go back to Thailand?

00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:55.080
It's also a nice opportunity
to exhibit work you have done here.

00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:06.400
Would you mind if…

00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:09.680
I need a little time to think about it.

00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:11.480
Yeah. Sure, sure.

00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:37.800
Hello?

00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:39.320
Pun, what time will you be back today?

00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:41.680
"Come home soon, okay?
I’m waiting to have dinner with you."

00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:43.360
I’m heading back now.

00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:45.640
"Alright."

00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:46.720
Mmm.

00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:54.320
"Since I got back this time,"

00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:57.040
"Phe’s been taking much better care of me."

00:59:57.320 --> 00:59:59.480
"He calls to check on me morning and night."

00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:01.600
"Some days he even drives me to work."

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:03.160
"And takes care of our house as well."

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:05.400
"He doesn’t even charge me rent."

01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:08.720
"And now he’s trying to get us legally married again."

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:10.000
"For free."

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:13.960
"Probably because he still feels guilty
about everything that happened."

01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:17.160
"Things are going well."

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:20.080
"It’s all going to be okay."

01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:56.880
Oh, Pun!

01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:58.720
Perfect timing. Dinner’s just ready.

01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:00.440
I was just about to call you.

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:11.360
Oh, I forgot to mention.
Today we have our honorary chef.

01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:43.000
- (Next episode)
- Ploy, please go.

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:45.640
Even if there’s only one percent left
of what you still feel for me,

01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:46.560
I won’t let go.

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:47.840
You’re playing with my feelings.

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:50.920
Do you have any idea
what it took for me to get through everything?

01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:53.680
How hard I tried
just to forget what we had?

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:57.360
I want you to think about yourself
for one week from now.

01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:58.920
If you still feel anything for me,

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:00.880
meet me here, in front of this picture.

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:02.320
I’ll be right here waiting.

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:03.920
I’m not going anywhere.

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:16.920
