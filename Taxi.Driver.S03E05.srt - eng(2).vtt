Driver Kim Do Gi, how did I do? I was good, right?

Looks like there's nothing left for me to teach you.

- Yes. - Just unload five boxes here.

She's right, you know. Go Eun's absolutely right.

You should've warmed up properly.

We've attached a powerful lens. It can reach 9m high,

It can't go any higher, can it?

What if the bad guys are in the basement?

00:08:05.265 --> 00:08:08.235
Right. We can just ask them to come upstairs.

I know. I'm offended, and she didn't have to say a word.

Of course I am. She could at least appreciate our efforts, not mock us.

I never called you.

00:11:06.475 --> 00:11:09.315
It's almost time for my Min Ho to get back from practice.

00:11:09.415 --> 00:11:11.745
(Writing Practice)

00:11:11.985 --> 00:11:13.015
Right, I have to hurry.

00:11:18.685 --> 00:11:19.925
I didn't call you.

00:11:23.255 --> 00:11:26.995
(An Elder's Handwriting)

00:11:27.695 --> 00:11:31.835
He was in a serious car accident and was hospitalized for a long time.

00:11:31.965 --> 00:11:35.735
His Alzheimer's symptoms got worse, so he was transferred to us.

00:11:36.735 --> 00:11:39.005
He's been with us for about five years now.

00:11:41.215 --> 00:11:45.115
By chance, is there any information on who caused the accident...

00:11:45.185 --> 00:11:47.185
or any insurance records?

00:11:48.815 --> 00:11:50.885
That's all we have from when he was transferred.

00:11:55.125 --> 00:11:58.265
It was a hit-and-run, and they never caught the driver,

00:11:59.095 --> 00:12:01.995
so as you can imagine, his insurance doesn't cover much.

00:12:02.795 --> 00:12:05.405
He's only covered by medical and living assistance,

00:12:05.505 --> 00:12:07.935
so he has hundreds of dollars in unpaid fees piling up monthly.

00:12:08.705 --> 00:12:11.545
I'll pay the outstanding balance in full.

00:12:13.875 --> 00:12:17.745
And we have all our patients fill this out.

00:12:17.945 --> 00:12:20.755
Mr. Park Dong Su filled this out himself.

00:12:21.655 --> 00:12:23.415
I'm not sure if it'll be helpful, though.

00:12:23.485 --> 00:12:25.625
(100 Questions for the Heart)

00:12:27.625 --> 00:12:29.295
Okay, thank you.

00:12:31.025 --> 00:12:33.565
(In one word, I am: A fool)

00:12:33.625 --> 00:12:35.995
(Hospital, Min Ho, watch, memory, bright light, big car)

00:12:44.745 --> 00:12:46.375
(My goal for this year is: Find Min Ho, no matter what)

00:12:46.445 --> 00:12:48.115
(My goal in this lifetime is: Watch the sunset with Min Ho)

00:12:48.245 --> 00:12:51.715
(To me, family is: Nonexistent)

00:12:54.655 --> 00:12:57.085
(Getting married, opening my store)

00:12:57.155 --> 00:12:58.655
(My wife's death, Min Ho becoming a volleyball player)

00:12:58.725 --> 00:13:02.425
(Jingwang University Volleyball Team)

00:13:02.495 --> 00:13:06.195
(Min Ho's disappearance)

00:13:12.935 --> 00:13:14.675
(Sometimes I feel sad for no reason.)

00:13:14.735 --> 00:13:16.305
(I sometimes find it hard to describe myself.)

00:13:16.375 --> 00:13:18.005
(I feel like every day is the same.)

00:13:18.075 --> 00:13:19.775
(Sometimes I feel like a stranger to myself.)

00:13:19.845 --> 00:13:22.844
(I feel like someone is still waiting for me.)

00:13:22.845 --> 00:13:25.614
(Life is joyful.)

00:13:25.615 --> 00:13:28.985
(I'm happy to be alive right now.)

00:13:38.865 --> 00:13:40.695
Out of these, it'd be great if we could get the top four soon.

00:13:41.165 --> 00:13:43.495
I'll ask them to send these four by the end of the week.

00:13:43.895 --> 00:13:45.965
Has anyone seen Mr. Jang today?

00:13:46.605 --> 00:13:47.605
Mr. Jang?

00:13:48.205 --> 00:13:51.305
- Isn't he in his office? - No. I just checked,

00:13:51.405 --> 00:13:53.145
and he's not picking up his phone.

00:13:53.445 --> 00:13:56.945
I tried calling him earlier, but he didn't pick up either.

00:13:57.015 --> 00:14:00.615
Come to think of it, after he called to trace that number,

00:14:00.685 --> 00:14:01.785
I don't think I've seen him.

00:14:03.715 --> 00:14:04.725
Trace a number?

00:14:05.055 --> 00:14:08.125
Yes. I don't know the details, but he sounded rushed.

00:14:26.575 --> 00:14:28.475
You should have some food with your drink.

00:14:29.545 --> 00:14:31.785
Go Eun would give you an earful if she saw you.

00:14:33.185 --> 00:14:34.855
How did you know I was here?

00:14:36.215 --> 00:14:37.925
I've noticed you come here sometimes.

00:14:39.085 --> 00:14:40.085
When you have something on your mind.

00:14:40.585 --> 00:14:43.425
I can't get anything past you, can I?

00:14:45.095 --> 00:14:47.795
Did you get to meet who you were looking for?

00:14:54.735 --> 00:14:57.805
Mind if I ask what this is about?

00:15:00.775 --> 00:15:01.775
Just how incompetent...

00:15:03.975 --> 00:15:05.985
and irresponsible...

00:15:07.045 --> 00:15:08.715
I truly am...

00:15:11.925 --> 00:15:15.055
I'll tell you when I've sobered up and have a clear head.

00:15:15.455 --> 00:15:17.155
Don't say that. Just tell us now.

00:15:17.695 --> 00:15:18.695
What?

00:15:21.595 --> 00:15:23.765
You don't have to have a clear head.

00:15:24.135 --> 00:15:26.105
I guess we'll just have to listen while we're all foggy-headed.

00:15:26.205 --> 00:15:29.175
I think I'm getting drunk already just from sitting here.

00:15:29.735 --> 00:15:32.305
Wait, how long have you all been here?

00:15:32.475 --> 00:15:35.415
We all came together. By tailing Driver Kim Do Gi.

00:15:35.975 --> 00:15:38.345
They asked where I was going,

00:15:38.885 --> 00:15:41.355
so I just told them I was coming to see you.

00:15:42.185 --> 00:15:43.985
You guys are impossible.

00:15:45.155 --> 00:15:47.125
Please tell us what's going on.

00:15:54.365 --> 00:15:55.365
Im Dong Hyeon.

00:15:57.195 --> 00:16:01.005
The day Im Dong Hyeon gets out of prison,

00:16:02.275 --> 00:16:05.405
I promised Dong Su I'd meet him there.

00:16:07.815 --> 00:16:08.845
Fifteen years ago.

00:16:10.075 --> 00:16:12.715
- Fifteen years ago? - Yes.

00:16:13.545 --> 00:16:14.585
The truth is,

00:16:15.815 --> 00:16:18.255
the reason I started Deluxe Taxi...

00:16:19.655 --> 00:16:21.295
was all because of Dong Su.

00:16:26.995 --> 00:16:30.395
Is it true you raped and assaulted the minor, Ms. Jin Yu Rim?

00:16:30.835 --> 00:16:33.235
- I never forced her. - Me neither.

00:16:33.635 --> 00:16:37.135
You gave consistent statements to the police and the prosecution.

00:16:37.745 --> 00:16:39.275
Are you recanting all of that now?

00:16:40.875 --> 00:16:42.375
(Defense)

00:16:43.015 --> 00:16:44.944
I was scared and confused back then,

00:16:44.945 --> 00:16:46.145
but I remember everything clearly now.

00:16:46.245 --> 00:16:49.085
It's true. Yu Rim was the one who came onto us first!

00:16:49.185 --> 00:16:50.215
You're lying!

00:16:51.785 --> 00:16:55.055
Because of what you scums did, Yu Rim took her own life.

00:16:55.125 --> 00:16:58.765
You should ask for forgiveness, not lying more, you jerks!

00:16:58.995 --> 00:17:02.365
- If we're lying, go ask Yu Rim. - What?

00:17:03.735 --> 00:17:07.805
You monster! How can you say that, you jerk!

00:17:08.305 --> 00:17:10.135
I won't let you two get away with this!

00:17:10.205 --> 00:17:13.875
The system, the police, prosecutors, and judges, had failed.

00:17:14.845 --> 00:17:17.845
The law, instead of protecting them, had cast out the innocent,

00:17:18.515 --> 00:17:21.715
forcing them into a lonely battle to protect themselves.

00:17:31.695 --> 00:17:33.195
- There he is! He's here! - Sir! Over here!

00:17:33.265 --> 00:17:34.935
- Do you admit to the charges? - A comment, please!

00:17:34.995 --> 00:17:37.065
- Look over here, please! - Over here! Just give us a comment!

00:17:37.135 --> 00:17:39.435
- We need a statement! - Please, just a moment!

00:17:39.535 --> 00:17:40.535
Say something!

00:17:40.835 --> 00:17:44.305
See? They're all over that celebrity scandal.

00:17:44.645 --> 00:17:46.805
They couldn't care less about us.

00:17:47.145 --> 00:17:48.944
Don't be nervous.

00:17:48.945 --> 00:17:51.945
I met the prosecutor yesterday. It's all sorted out.

00:17:52.185 --> 00:17:55.715
- This case is as good as won. - You're lying!

00:17:57.955 --> 00:18:01.095
Who says you've won? This trial isn't over yet.

00:18:01.295 --> 00:18:04.395
If you want to make a claim, bring some evidence.

00:18:04.725 --> 00:18:09.035
You can't just throw a tantrum and make baseless claims without proof.

00:18:09.165 --> 00:18:10.865
You're the ones who stopped me!

00:18:11.405 --> 00:18:13.665
Whenever I tried to do anything,

00:18:14.035 --> 00:18:17.505
you'd sue and block over and over!

00:18:18.245 --> 00:18:19.575
You made sure I couldn't do a thing!

00:18:20.005 --> 00:18:22.345
And you'd need proof of that, too, right?

00:18:22.875 --> 00:18:23.875
Attorney Cha.

00:18:24.485 --> 00:18:25.485
Let's go.

00:18:42.465 --> 00:18:43.495
The verdict.

00:18:43.895 --> 00:18:45.764
The defendant, Im Dong Hyeon,

00:18:45.765 --> 00:18:47.165
is sentenced to five months in prison...

00:18:48.105 --> 00:18:50.735
and 80 hours of community service.

00:18:53.805 --> 00:18:56.775
What kind of justice is this?

00:18:57.245 --> 00:19:00.845
He killed a man, and he only gets five months?

00:19:01.685 --> 00:19:03.415
What kind of justice is this?

00:19:03.685 --> 00:19:04.955
My son...

00:19:05.255 --> 00:19:08.195
We still haven't even found his body!

00:19:09.755 --> 00:19:11.124
I guess he really doesn't know...

00:19:11.125 --> 00:19:12.725
Im Dong Hyeon wasn't even charged with murder.

00:19:12.965 --> 00:19:14.395
Forget it. Let him stay ignorant.

00:19:15.135 --> 00:19:18.065
- All right, let's go. - Hey! Wait!

00:19:18.605 --> 00:19:21.475
Tell me where my son is. Please, just tell me.

00:19:21.705 --> 00:19:25.505
He deserves a funeral, doesn't he?

00:19:25.705 --> 00:19:28.775
Look, we just got into a fight. I didn't kill him.

00:19:30.515 --> 00:19:33.785
- I told you, I didn't kill him. - Just tell me!

00:19:34.245 --> 00:19:35.455
I said, tell me!

00:19:37.485 --> 00:19:39.325
Where is my son?

00:19:40.485 --> 00:19:41.495
Hey!

00:19:41.825 --> 00:19:44.665
You people... Are you even human?

00:19:58.675 --> 00:20:03.415
Are you even human? What kind of law is this?

00:20:05.485 --> 00:20:08.155
To keep those who were wronged from giving up,

00:20:09.715 --> 00:20:13.285
I sought a way to fight for them to the very end, outside the law.

00:20:15.755 --> 00:20:17.395
And that's where I found Dong Su.

00:21:08.015 --> 00:21:09.515

Do you think doing that...

00:22:55.215 --> 00:22:56.685
is going to change anything?

00:23:01.955 --> 00:23:03.295
The hope that if you die,

00:23:03.695 --> 00:23:06.625
they might reopen the investigation.

00:23:07.865 --> 00:23:09.065
I know that feeling all too well.

00:23:10.795 --> 00:23:12.165
But do you really think they will?

00:23:13.865 --> 00:23:15.505
What you're hoping for...

00:23:17.235 --> 00:23:19.275
Those people will never give it to you.

00:23:20.705 --> 00:23:21.775
Then what...

00:23:23.715 --> 00:23:25.485
am I supposed to do?

00:23:27.545 --> 00:23:29.815
There's nothing else...

00:23:32.525 --> 00:23:33.525
I can do.

00:23:34.285 --> 00:23:35.695
Still, don't kill yourself.

00:23:40.265 --> 00:23:41.265
Don't die.

Goodness.

00:24:45.865 --> 00:24:48.465
I can't believe how many lawsuits have been filed against you.

00:24:50.195 --> 00:24:53.735
If I even so much as ask what happened to my Min Ho,

00:24:53.805 --> 00:24:58.675
they'd hit me with lawsuits for obstruction and damages.

00:24:59.005 --> 00:25:00.845
They stopped me from doing anything.

00:25:01.945 --> 00:25:02.945
I just...

00:25:03.415 --> 00:25:05.885
feel so helpless not knowing the law,

00:25:07.685 --> 00:25:11.055
and I had no idea what to do.

00:25:12.325 --> 00:25:14.025
Let me see what I can do about these.

00:25:16.255 --> 00:25:17.295
And one more thing.

00:25:18.525 --> 00:25:20.465
How about we meet up once a week?

00:25:20.865 --> 00:25:22.395

00:25:22.865 --> 00:25:23.865
Yes.

00:25:24.395 --> 00:25:27.935
In the meantime, I'll go over all the documents you've gathered,

00:25:28.705 --> 00:25:31.235
and I'll figure out what else we need to prepare.

00:25:38.985 --> 00:25:41.485
Please. There's no need for that.

00:25:41.985 --> 00:25:43.915
Let's just give it everything we've got.

00:25:46.425 --> 00:25:49.255
All right, I'll take these with me.

00:25:50.195 --> 00:25:51.565
Okay.

00:25:53.165 --> 00:25:55.934
- It was 7:40pm. - At 7:40pm...

00:25:55.935 --> 00:25:58.605
This one was his call with me.

00:26:00.835 --> 00:26:04.575
And this last call was at 8:01pm.

00:26:05.405 --> 00:26:06.475
With Im Dong Hyeon.

00:26:06.775 --> 00:26:09.615
After that, I started visiting him once a week,

00:26:10.015 --> 00:26:12.415
and Dong Su and I became quite close.

00:26:15.255 --> 00:26:19.125
Excuse me! Hey, students! Can I ask you something?

00:26:19.255 --> 00:26:21.324
- Okay. - About Park Min Ho...

00:26:21.325 --> 00:26:22.725
and Im Dong Hyeon from the volleyball team.

00:26:22.955 --> 00:26:25.495
Do you happen to know if something happened between them?

00:26:25.565 --> 00:26:27.995
- We're freshmen, so we don't know. - Here's Park Min Ho.

00:26:28.025 --> 00:26:31.065
- I'm hungry. Let's go. - Park Min Ho.

00:26:39.905 --> 00:26:43.445
I was just hoping that as the coach, you might know something.

00:26:43.545 --> 00:26:45.685
Sir, what am I supposed to say when you ask me that?

00:26:46.285 --> 00:26:47.645
Sorry I couldn't be of any help.

00:26:53.955 --> 00:26:55.355
That can't be right.

00:27:00.325 --> 00:27:04.265
- Let's go ask somewhere else. - Okay.

00:27:12.205 --> 00:27:13.375
Dinner's ready.

00:27:13.645 --> 00:27:15.445
- Come on in. - All right, Dong Su.

00:27:16.445 --> 00:27:17.445
By the way...

00:27:17.745 --> 00:27:18.745
Yes?

00:27:19.315 --> 00:27:21.815
All the other clocks are working just fine,

00:27:22.885 --> 00:27:24.415
but why has that one stopped?

00:27:25.055 --> 00:27:26.085
That one?

00:27:27.355 --> 00:27:28.355
It's a secret.

00:27:29.925 --> 00:27:34.225
What, a stopped clock is a secret now? Goodness.

00:27:35.565 --> 00:27:38.735
You really shouldn't have gone to all this trouble.

00:27:39.565 --> 00:27:44.475
It's nothing. I wanted to cook a meal for you.

00:27:44.945 --> 00:27:46.405
Thank you for the meal.

00:27:50.645 --> 00:27:51.645
Gosh.

00:27:52.315 --> 00:27:55.415
You could open a restaurant. You'd make a killing.

00:27:55.585 --> 00:27:59.185
Even though my Min Ho grew up without his mom,

00:28:00.225 --> 00:28:03.155
I wanted him to have the same foods other kids had,

00:28:03.225 --> 00:28:06.965
so I learned to cook all sorts and fed him.

00:28:07.265 --> 00:28:10.195
I'm definitely going to eat too much today.

00:28:10.695 --> 00:28:15.035
I also packed you some side dishes, so take them when you leave.

00:28:15.105 --> 00:28:16.105
I will.

00:28:16.375 --> 00:28:18.945
- Hey! You should eat too. - Right.

00:28:25.885 --> 00:28:28.414
- So? What'd you find? - It was ruled a simple assault,

00:28:28.415 --> 00:28:29.415
so there isn't enough data.

00:28:29.685 --> 00:28:32.625
Plus, it looks like the lawyers took the little documents there were.

00:28:34.755 --> 00:28:36.625
I don't know if this will be helpful.

00:28:46.565 --> 00:28:48.505
(Evidence: Jingwang University)

00:28:57.845 --> 00:28:59.884
- What's all this noise? - Some guy keeps demanding...

00:28:59.885 --> 00:29:01.914
the files regarding Park Min Ho.

00:29:01.915 --> 00:29:05.255
- He's been making a scene. - Park Min Ho? Darn it.

00:29:05.455 --> 00:29:07.385
Why didn't you call the cops right away?

00:29:07.455 --> 00:29:10.695
- I did, but he just came back. - What?

00:29:10.755 --> 00:29:12.725
- Let me go! I'm not leaving! - Sir, you need to...

00:29:12.795 --> 00:29:14.725
- I'm not leaving without them! - Quiet down!

00:29:17.465 --> 00:29:18.465
What on earth...

00:29:19.235 --> 00:29:22.375
What do you think you're doing at my office?

00:29:22.775 --> 00:29:24.935
I'm here for the case files.

00:29:25.145 --> 00:29:26.645
Why are you asking us for them?

00:29:26.745 --> 00:29:29.745
Because you took everything, including the original files.

00:29:29.815 --> 00:29:34.115
Don't give me that nonsense and just get out immediately!

00:29:34.185 --> 00:29:36.885
I'm not leaving without those files.

00:29:40.125 --> 00:29:42.455
I tried asking nicely.

00:29:43.695 --> 00:29:44.925
Do you really want me to sue you?

00:29:45.925 --> 00:29:47.865
Do you want me to have you thrown in prison for real?

00:29:48.125 --> 00:29:51.965
Prison? Great! I happen to love prison food!

00:29:52.635 --> 00:29:54.265
Even if you have me arrested,

00:29:54.435 --> 00:29:57.235
I'll come back here again when I get released.

00:29:57.935 --> 00:30:01.575
I came empty-handed today, but I won't be next time. Got it?

00:30:01.705 --> 00:30:04.244
- This guy's unbelievable. - Go ahead, press charges again.

00:30:04.245 --> 00:30:05.885
If I get released,

00:30:05.915 --> 00:30:08.885
I'm off to the parking lot to smash your car first.

00:30:10.055 --> 00:30:13.455
Darn it. This guy's a loose cannon.

00:30:13.525 --> 00:30:16.795
Do what you want. Sue me again. I don't care!

00:30:17.395 --> 00:30:21.265
And when I get out, I'm coming to your house. Got it?

00:30:23.295 --> 00:30:24.335
Fine!

00:30:24.895 --> 00:30:25.965
All right!

00:30:27.735 --> 00:30:28.735
Attorney Yu.

00:30:29.505 --> 00:30:31.535
Just give him what he wants and get him out of here.

00:30:33.245 --> 00:30:34.245
What are you waiting for?

00:30:34.705 --> 00:30:38.585
I said we'll give you what you want, so take it and get out of here.

00:30:38.985 --> 00:30:40.285
Would you come with me, please?

00:30:51.755 --> 00:30:52.795
Hey, wait a second.

00:30:53.725 --> 00:30:54.825
Let me ask you one thing.

00:30:55.695 --> 00:30:58.905
Why on earth are you going to such lengths for this?

00:31:00.365 --> 00:31:02.875
To be honest, this isn't even your business, is it?

00:31:08.005 --> 00:31:09.015
No.

00:31:10.075 --> 00:31:11.115
This is my business.

00:31:32.365 --> 00:31:33.365
Gosh...

00:31:38.335 --> 00:31:40.545
(Locker room CCTV)

00:31:49.955 --> 00:31:50.955
Hold on a second.

00:31:52.685 --> 00:31:53.755
Something looks off.

00:31:58.565 --> 00:32:00.565
Right there, in the shadows...

00:32:00.865 --> 00:32:03.235
Doesn't it look like he's talking to someone?

00:32:05.235 --> 00:32:07.505
(Im Dong Hyeon)

00:32:08.935 --> 00:32:10.075
Im Dong Hyeon...

00:32:11.405 --> 00:32:13.905
wasn't alone in there that day.

00:32:16.175 --> 00:32:20.315
(Im Dong Hyeon)

00:32:21.415 --> 00:32:22.485
Dong Hyeon.

00:32:23.215 --> 00:32:26.625
You're my son Min Ho's friend, aren't you?

00:32:27.525 --> 00:32:30.625
I already told you the truth, so why do you keep hassling me?

00:32:31.125 --> 00:32:33.695
I told you, the fight just happened, and I'm the one who hurt him.

00:32:34.025 --> 00:32:36.765
I confessed, so I've been stuck here for five months.

00:32:37.435 --> 00:32:39.305
So what else could you possibly want me to say?

00:32:40.535 --> 00:32:42.105
I know you weren't alone.

00:32:43.775 --> 00:32:47.475
That day in the locker room, behind the second set of lockers,

00:32:47.545 --> 00:32:50.945
I know there was someone else with you.

00:32:53.815 --> 00:32:56.955
What happened that day...

00:32:59.385 --> 00:33:01.385
and where my Min Ho is.

00:33:02.095 --> 00:33:04.155
Just tell me that, please.

00:33:07.525 --> 00:33:09.695
You're really starting to annoy me.

00:33:10.235 --> 00:33:11.395
I don't know.

00:33:11.535 --> 00:33:13.035
I don't know anything.

00:33:14.905 --> 00:33:16.505
I'm refusing all your visits from now on.

00:33:16.875 --> 00:33:18.205
So don't come and see me again.

00:33:19.045 --> 00:33:22.045
I'll find out everything, whether you tell me or not.

00:33:22.575 --> 00:33:24.215
You hear me? Who you were with that day...

00:33:24.675 --> 00:33:26.745
and what happened to my Min Ho.

00:33:27.245 --> 00:33:29.855
I swear I will find out everything!

00:33:42.995 --> 00:33:46.465
Since he's already in prison, unless he admits to another crime...

00:33:46.705 --> 00:33:50.075
or some hard evidence turns up, it's going to be tough.

00:33:50.335 --> 00:33:51.935
It's the principle of double jeopardy.

00:33:52.305 --> 00:33:55.005
Is that right? Thanks. I'll be in touch.

00:33:57.045 --> 00:33:58.145
What did he say?

00:33:59.415 --> 00:34:01.185
He told me not to come back.

00:34:01.945 --> 00:34:04.115
And that he'll refuse all my visits from now on.

00:34:04.715 --> 00:34:05.725
Listen, Dong Su.

00:34:07.085 --> 00:34:09.755
It's hot out. Why don't we get some cold noodles?

00:34:12.565 --> 00:34:17.295
Him refusing your visits means he has something to hide.

00:34:18.195 --> 00:34:19.735
That's why he's avoiding you.

00:34:24.275 --> 00:34:25.475
But listen.

00:34:26.475 --> 00:34:28.075
Back at the trial,

00:34:30.415 --> 00:34:31.845
why did you say...

00:34:33.015 --> 00:34:34.585
that your son, Min Ho, died?

00:34:37.455 --> 00:34:39.255
Most parents would hope their son is still alive.

00:34:39.555 --> 00:34:41.255
That he's alive out there somewhere,

00:34:42.095 --> 00:34:45.725
and that one day he'll come home.

00:34:47.895 --> 00:34:49.395
Because I know.

00:34:50.835 --> 00:34:53.505
Even if the whole world doesn't, I do.

00:34:54.305 --> 00:34:55.335
I'm his dad.

00:34:58.745 --> 00:35:00.475
More than anyone else in this world,

00:35:01.845 --> 00:35:03.975
I was the one who hoped my Min Ho was still alive.

00:35:05.785 --> 00:35:09.515
And I prayed for him to come home.

00:35:14.225 --> 00:35:17.625
But then one night, Min Ho came to me in a dream.

00:35:18.595 --> 00:35:19.595
Dad!

00:35:20.265 --> 00:35:21.425
Don't look for me anymore.

00:35:23.965 --> 00:35:25.505
It'll only make things harder for you.

00:35:26.205 --> 00:35:27.565
I'm okay,

00:35:28.975 --> 00:35:30.075
so please stop looking for me.

00:35:31.575 --> 00:35:32.575
Okay?

00:35:39.845 --> 00:35:40.885
That's when I knew.

00:35:42.855 --> 00:35:44.415
That my Min Ho was dead.

00:35:46.985 --> 00:35:48.085
Those jerks...

00:35:50.395 --> 00:35:53.195
had killed my son.

00:36:01.865 --> 00:36:02.935
Dong Su.

00:36:03.875 --> 00:36:06.945
What if we start preparing meticulously from now...

00:36:07.805 --> 00:36:10.875
and wait for him right outside when that jerk gets out?

00:36:11.245 --> 00:36:14.885
If we plan it out perfectly, there's no way that guy can escape.

00:36:15.415 --> 00:36:18.585
We'll grab him and won't let go until he spits out the truth.

00:36:21.325 --> 00:36:23.295
We won't let him go. What do you say?

00:36:25.295 --> 00:36:27.065
Yes. Let's do it.

00:36:27.725 --> 00:36:29.665
Then the last one there buys dinner.

00:36:30.095 --> 00:36:33.105
Please, I have a huge advantage.

00:36:34.165 --> 00:36:36.705
Because I fully intend to keep that promise.

00:36:37.975 --> 00:36:40.505
Great. The food's here.

00:36:41.345 --> 00:36:44.075
All right, thank you.

00:36:44.345 --> 00:36:45.445
- Enjoy. - Thanks.

00:36:46.245 --> 00:36:48.885
Oh, right. By the way,

00:36:50.055 --> 00:36:52.155
I was thinking of starting up something like this.

00:36:53.025 --> 00:36:54.025
What is it?

00:36:55.155 --> 00:36:56.395
What do you think?

00:36:56.455 --> 00:36:57.725
(Don't die. Get revenge.)

00:36:57.795 --> 00:36:59.465
I'm 100 percent on board.

00:37:00.765 --> 00:37:04.895
The phrase "Don't die. Get revenge." That's what kept me going.

00:37:06.405 --> 00:37:07.405
(Deluxe Taxi)

00:37:09.005 --> 00:37:11.005
Will you join me in getting revenge?

00:37:11.975 --> 00:37:14.674
If you take this on too, you won't have time to rest.

00:37:14.675 --> 00:37:16.115
You'll work yourself to death.

00:37:16.275 --> 00:37:18.075
That's why I have to get revenge, not die.

00:37:20.345 --> 00:37:21.345
Go on, eat.

00:37:23.555 --> 00:37:26.825
(The day of Im Dong Hyeon's release)

00:37:28.525 --> 00:37:33.025
Since we met every week, I assumed I'd see Dong Su that day too.

00:37:33.495 --> 00:37:35.935
(A Correctional Service Inspiring Hope and Public Trust)

00:37:36.495 --> 00:37:38.365
There he is. Over here!

00:37:40.735 --> 00:37:42.305
- You've been through a lot. - Yes.

00:37:44.075 --> 00:37:45.175
Im Dong Hyeon!

00:37:47.275 --> 00:37:48.674
Im Dong Hyeon!

00:37:48.675 --> 00:37:50.115
Im Dong Hyeon, I need to talk to you.

00:37:50.375 --> 00:37:51.445
Im Dong Hyeon...

00:37:52.015 --> 00:37:53.115
Hey, Im Dong Hyeon!

00:38:11.535 --> 00:38:12.565
Dong Su?

00:38:37.525 --> 00:38:39.695
After he vanished like a mirage,

00:38:40.465 --> 00:38:42.865
I never saw him again.

00:38:44.065 --> 00:38:47.005
The last time I went to his watch shop,

00:38:48.165 --> 00:38:50.605
someone else was already living there.

00:38:53.675 --> 00:38:55.745
So he just moved without saying anything?

00:38:56.445 --> 00:38:57.445
Yes.

00:38:58.575 --> 00:39:01.745
I wondered if maybe he just wanted to forget everything.

00:39:02.515 --> 00:39:04.185
That he wanted to leave it all behind,

00:39:04.615 --> 00:39:07.685
and that's why he cut all ties with me.

00:39:09.595 --> 00:39:11.525
At least, that's what I thought.

00:39:13.695 --> 00:39:15.935
But today, I saw him again.

00:39:17.865 --> 00:39:19.035
Dong Su.

00:39:19.635 --> 00:39:22.105
He was in the same spot from 15 years ago...

00:39:23.275 --> 00:39:24.875
exactly as he was.

00:39:25.905 --> 00:39:30.275
- Looking so frail. - I never called you.

00:39:31.275 --> 00:39:33.384
If only I'd tried harder to find him,

00:39:33.385 --> 00:39:35.485
would things have changed?

00:39:37.985 --> 00:39:39.885
If I hadn't been...

00:39:40.955 --> 00:39:43.125
so darn useless,

00:39:46.165 --> 00:39:49.195
I wouldn't have had to see him like that.

00:39:51.895 --> 00:39:53.565
I regret that so much.

00:39:58.235 --> 00:40:00.075
I don't think that's it, Mr. Jang.

00:40:01.945 --> 00:40:03.345
This isn't something to regret.

00:40:03.845 --> 00:40:05.845
It's something we have to fix.

00:40:06.115 --> 00:40:07.145
I agree.

00:40:07.545 --> 00:40:09.215
Besides, you took on his case, right, Mr. Jang?

00:40:09.555 --> 00:40:11.655
You already did 15 years ago, no less.

00:40:12.085 --> 00:40:14.285
So the case is still open, then?

00:40:16.025 --> 00:40:17.225
You guys...

00:40:17.495 --> 00:40:20.465
Gosh, how much do we even charge for a 15-year taxi ride?

00:40:20.665 --> 00:40:21.895
You'd really charge him for that?

00:40:21.965 --> 00:40:24.195
It was a joke. You're the jerk for taking it so seriously.

00:40:24.335 --> 00:40:25.335
Goodness.

00:40:25.805 --> 00:40:27.835
But he...

00:40:28.865 --> 00:40:33.305
doesn't even remember that he made the request in the first place.

00:40:33.375 --> 00:40:34.975
All the more reason to hurry, then.

00:40:35.475 --> 00:40:37.645
Before his memory fades completely.

00:40:38.775 --> 00:40:41.845
Gosh, if it's been 15 years, that's quite a long time ago.

00:40:41.945 --> 00:40:45.215
The key will be how much information is still available today.

00:40:45.385 --> 00:40:46.385
Exactly.

00:40:46.755 --> 00:40:50.055
The more we have to work with, the more options we'll have.

00:40:50.495 --> 00:40:54.225
Should we gather everything first and then plan our next move?

00:40:56.065 --> 00:40:59.465
Mr. Jang, can we see the old case files?

00:41:07.645 --> 00:41:09.614
I'll start with...

00:41:09.615 --> 00:41:11.245
- the court records then. - Okay.

00:41:11.345 --> 00:41:13.915
For something 15 years old, it's got to be in that corner.

00:41:14.145 --> 00:41:15.615
- Let's go find it. - Okay.

00:41:25.255 --> 00:41:27.925
Defendant, Im Dong Hyeon. Victim, Park Min Ho.

00:41:29.765 --> 00:41:31.595
Should I start by digging into Im Dong Hyeon?

00:41:32.665 --> 00:41:33.735
Okay.

00:41:36.675 --> 00:41:37.934
Let's take all of them out...

00:41:37.935 --> 00:41:39.705
- and look through them together. - Okay.

00:41:46.615 --> 00:41:48.585
(Park Dong Su)

00:41:51.755 --> 00:41:54.355
(Don't die. Get revenge)

00:42:10.005 --> 00:42:11.574
(Perjury, prosecutors, preferential treatment for former officials...)

00:42:11.575 --> 00:42:15.375
(I can't see a way to get revenge no matter what I try.)

00:42:39.095 --> 00:42:40.335
Aren't you tired?

00:42:46.745 --> 00:42:47.745
Thanks.

00:42:48.205 --> 00:42:50.045
You're working nonstop, aren't you?

00:42:50.845 --> 00:42:53.885
I have to work twice as hard on this case.

00:42:54.945 --> 00:42:56.015
Why's that?

00:42:57.355 --> 00:42:58.914
We have two clients, don't we?

00:42:58.915 --> 00:43:01.055
Oh, you're right.

00:43:03.395 --> 00:43:05.295
Closing this case would be...

00:43:05.495 --> 00:43:07.965
a big relief for Mr. Jang, don't you think?

00:43:09.965 --> 00:43:11.135
Let's hope so.

00:43:13.065 --> 00:43:15.365
Cheers to that!

00:43:16.735 --> 00:43:17.775
Cheers.

00:44:35.985 --> 00:44:38.715
Dad, you have to come right now! Hurry!

00:44:39.625 --> 00:44:40.625
Min Ho.

00:44:41.555 --> 00:44:43.155
Min Ho... Min Ho!

00:44:46.995 --> 00:44:48.995
(Watch Repair, Straps, Batteries, Crystal)

00:45:03.115 --> 00:45:04.115
Dong Su!

00:45:08.715 --> 00:45:11.955
What are you doing? It's dangerous standing in the road!

00:45:12.925 --> 00:45:15.925
But Min Ho told me to come out here right away.

00:45:16.395 --> 00:45:17.395
The car...

00:45:24.465 --> 00:45:25.695
But who are you?

00:45:26.235 --> 00:45:27.405
Do you know me?

00:45:28.105 --> 00:45:29.105
Dong Su...

00:45:32.035 --> 00:45:36.515
His periods of lucidity are becoming noticeably shorter.

00:45:38.315 --> 00:45:41.015
If they're shorter, by how much?

00:45:41.685 --> 00:45:45.615
Just last month, he was lucid for two hours a week.

00:45:45.785 --> 00:45:48.125
Now, it's less than 30 minutes.

00:45:48.625 --> 00:45:50.295
The lucid intervals are short,

00:45:51.825 --> 00:45:56.265
and if this continues, he may soon be unable to talk.

00:45:58.465 --> 00:46:00.205
Im Dong Hyeon and Park Min Ho.

00:46:00.365 --> 00:46:03.675
They were both born in 1990 and were college teammates.

00:46:03.775 --> 00:46:06.705
After a volleyball match, they went back to the school...

00:46:06.775 --> 00:46:10.645
and fought in the locker room over the outcome of the game.

00:46:10.775 --> 00:46:13.684
Im Dong Hyeon attacked Park Min Ho with a weapon...

00:46:13.685 --> 00:46:15.615
and got sentenced to five months' imprisonment.

00:46:15.885 --> 00:46:16.885
What?

00:46:17.155 --> 00:46:20.125
But didn't Mr. Park Dong Su say Im Dong Hyeon killed his son?

00:46:20.325 --> 00:46:23.625
I don't think Park Min Ho's death was even mentioned in the trial.

00:46:24.695 --> 00:46:25.695
That's probably...

00:46:26.865 --> 00:46:28.065
because of this.

00:46:39.205 --> 00:46:40.205
Goodness.

00:46:44.915 --> 00:46:47.745
Don't tell me it's because the murder wasn't caught on camera.

00:46:48.315 --> 00:46:50.515
No. It's because of the next clip.

00:46:54.955 --> 00:46:57.595
Number ten. That's Park Min Ho's jersey.

00:46:57.695 --> 00:47:02.425
So since Park Min Ho left the dorm perfectly fine after the fight,

00:47:02.495 --> 00:47:04.235
they claimed his death had nothing to do with the assault.

00:47:04.465 --> 00:47:08.165
Except, I don't think the person in this footage is Park Min Ho.

00:47:08.935 --> 00:47:10.675
What makes you so sure?

00:47:20.145 --> 00:47:21.745
These are photos of Park Min Ho, right?

00:47:22.015 --> 00:47:23.985
Everyone has habits they're not even aware of.

00:47:24.985 --> 00:47:28.185
Someone who puts their left shoe on first will do it every single time.

00:47:28.585 --> 00:47:30.255
Same goes for which shoulder they carry their bag on.

00:47:31.755 --> 00:47:32.755
Wait.

00:47:33.095 --> 00:47:35.965
The bag is on his other shoulder. It's left here, but right there.

00:47:38.295 --> 00:47:40.804
So was someone else wearing Park Min Ho's clothes...

00:47:40.805 --> 00:47:42.305
to trick people?

00:47:43.005 --> 00:47:45.934
Maybe, but we can't be sure, can we?

00:47:45.935 --> 00:47:47.345
We can barely see his face.

00:47:47.805 --> 00:47:49.875
Exactly. He could've just lent his clothes to someone.

00:47:50.145 --> 00:47:52.045
Even if they had gotten a shot of his face,

00:47:52.315 --> 00:47:54.545
it'd be hard to identify him with that video quality.

00:47:54.815 --> 00:47:58.515
And yet, 15 years ago, they assumed it was Park Min Ho.

00:48:00.725 --> 00:48:04.195
Since no one believed Mr. Park Dong Su 15 years ago,

00:48:04.795 --> 00:48:05.795
let's do the reverse.

00:48:06.425 --> 00:48:07.995
What if we trust him completely?

00:48:09.125 --> 00:48:10.235
Sounds good.

00:48:10.295 --> 00:48:11.595
That's a fantastic idea.

00:48:11.635 --> 00:48:12.695
Say no more.

00:48:13.265 --> 00:48:14.305

Can you find out where he is now?

00:48:45.295 --> 00:48:47.735
Of course. I've already found him.

00:48:48.135 --> 00:48:49.135
Already?

00:48:49.775 --> 00:48:51.735

00:52:36.935 --> 00:52:39.734
What? But he didn't even say who he was here to see.

00:52:39.735 --> 00:52:41.835
How could he be in the wrong place? What's going on?

00:52:49.575 --> 00:52:51.815
They seem to be guarding the entrance, not the memorial.

00:52:52.115 --> 00:52:55.345
Why is the chief mourner at the door instead of staying with the altar?

00:52:55.445 --> 00:52:57.085
What a strange funeral home.

00:52:57.615 --> 00:52:58.815
Should we go and give you a hand?

00:52:59.925 --> 00:53:00.985
It's okay.

00:53:02.085 --> 00:53:03.225
You've already helped.

00:53:06.595 --> 00:53:07.995
(Deluxe Taxi)

00:53:25.345 --> 00:53:27.945
Is this thing ever going to get to the top?

00:53:31.085 --> 00:53:32.415
Is it even moving?

00:53:32.855 --> 00:53:34.425
Was it always this slow?

00:53:35.155 --> 00:53:36.725
I don't think it's broken, though.

00:53:37.155 --> 00:53:38.855
It'd better not be.

00:53:39.195 --> 00:53:42.194
Driver Kim, just relax for now and listen to music.

00:53:42.195 --> 00:53:43.535
You'll have a visual soon.

00:53:46.265 --> 00:53:49.135
Gyeong Gu, I think it's a little too low.

00:53:49.165 --> 00:53:51.834
- It's going to be a tight squeeze. - It can't be.

00:53:51.835 --> 00:53:53.545
Go Eun's watching.

00:53:53.705 --> 00:53:57.045
Should I tell them to come down? It looks like a tight squeeze.

00:54:11.925 --> 00:54:13.465
So it was a gambling den after all.

00:54:14.165 --> 00:54:15.295
I fold.

00:54:16.695 --> 00:54:19.435
- A hundred dollars? You won fast. - I'll see your 50...

00:54:20.165 --> 00:54:24.435
- and raise 100. - They decorated with funeral items.

00:54:25.105 --> 00:54:26.335
Unbelievable.

00:54:26.475 --> 00:54:29.205
They sure put a lot of effort into hiding this place.

00:54:29.475 --> 00:54:31.275
Even the police wouldn't suspect a thing.

00:54:31.415 --> 00:54:34.115
Who'd think to put a gambling den inside a funeral home?

00:54:35.885 --> 00:54:37.085
So does that mean those cars...

00:54:37.315 --> 00:54:39.585
are collateral for gambling debts?

00:54:41.385 --> 00:54:43.925
I checked Im Dong Hyeon's finances.

00:54:44.055 --> 00:54:45.294
Right after he got out of prison,

00:54:45.295 --> 00:54:47.365
he acquired a studio apartment in his name.

00:54:48.095 --> 00:54:49.125
A studio apartment?

00:54:49.495 --> 00:54:52.995
But there's a lien on it now. He borrowed a lot and defaulted.

00:55:00.045 --> 00:55:01.244
You're betting 100 chips?

00:55:01.245 --> 00:55:03.745
My gosh, are you really betting 100 on this?

00:55:03.845 --> 00:55:06.915
What kind of hand do you have to be throwing in 100 chips?

00:55:07.645 --> 00:55:10.785
I guess Mr. Im here is a rich boy, betting so recklessly.

00:55:10.815 --> 00:55:13.955
Cut the chitchat. Are you going to fold or not?

00:55:13.985 --> 00:55:16.955
You can't "die" at a funeral home, can you?

00:55:17.595 --> 00:55:18.595
Call.

00:55:19.855 --> 00:55:22.695
- A pair of sevens. - I have a pair of nines.

00:55:22.765 --> 00:55:24.165
Thank you very much.

00:55:24.895 --> 00:55:25.895
What?

00:55:26.395 --> 00:55:28.505
What if Im Dong Hyeon went to prison...

00:55:29.205 --> 00:55:31.735
for the purpose of covering up another truth?

00:55:32.535 --> 00:55:35.045
- Another truth? - On that day, 15 years ago,

00:55:36.105 --> 00:55:38.645
Im Dong Hyeon wasn't in the locker room alone.

00:55:40.015 --> 00:55:42.985
Then the studio he suddenly acquired could have been his payment.

00:55:43.355 --> 00:55:44.415
As for that answer,

00:55:45.115 --> 00:55:46.825
we'll have to get it from Im Dong Hyeon himself.

00:55:47.425 --> 00:55:49.155
I doubt he'll talk easily.

00:55:50.155 --> 00:55:51.655
But he will for Park Min Ho.

00:55:52.395 --> 00:55:53.965
What? Park Min Ho?

00:55:54.425 --> 00:55:59.395
Let's see how Im Dong Hyeon reacts to Park Min Ho.

00:56:01.365 --> 00:56:02.735
Whether he'll be happy to see him...

00:56:03.975 --> 00:56:05.105
or unsettled.

00:56:09.705 --> 00:56:12.875
I got my car back, but I've got nothing left. Darn it.

00:56:17.355 --> 00:56:18.355
What's this?

00:56:19.385 --> 00:56:20.655
What is this thing?

00:56:21.825 --> 00:56:24.525
Long time no see, old friend. How have you been?

00:56:37.805 --> 00:56:39.805
(Shed the Fat, Special Discount for Cash Payments)

00:56:41.905 --> 00:56:44.045
- Hello, Mr. Im. - Get these ready in advance.

00:56:44.115 --> 00:56:46.075
- Let me get that. - No, I've got it.

00:56:46.145 --> 00:56:49.185
- Okay. - Sir, you had a phone call earlier.

00:56:49.245 --> 00:56:51.255
- About four times. - Who was it?

00:56:51.285 --> 00:56:54.155
He said he was a friend of yours. The name was Park Min Ho.

00:56:55.585 --> 00:56:59.125
- Who? - Park Min Ho. He spelled it out.

00:56:59.925 --> 00:57:01.065
What did he say?

00:57:01.865 --> 00:57:03.195
He said he'd call back.

00:57:05.435 --> 00:57:06.595
Okay, got it.

00:57:17.815 --> 00:57:20.815
Seong Uk, that jerk never picks up when I call.

00:57:22.215 --> 00:57:24.355
He only calls when he feels like it. Darn it.

00:57:28.285 --> 00:57:29.685
Park Min Ho.

00:57:32.795 --> 00:57:34.625
This really ticks me off.

00:57:36.795 --> 00:57:39.395
There's no way.

00:57:43.365 --> 00:57:45.375
Why is it so high? Darn.

00:57:49.005 --> 00:57:51.575
Are these jerks messing with me with flyers?

00:57:57.515 --> 00:57:58.585
But are you okay?

00:57:58.985 --> 00:58:00.485
You said you did everything.

00:58:01.055 --> 00:58:02.125
Are you really okay?

00:58:02.455 --> 00:58:03.755
Who on earth is it?

00:58:04.525 --> 00:58:06.225
Who is messing with me?

00:58:09.465 --> 00:58:11.635
- Are you heading out again? - No.

00:58:12.335 --> 00:58:14.435
- Are you looking for something? - No, just get back to work.

00:58:23.245 --> 00:58:24.315
What is this?

00:58:25.775 --> 00:58:28.715
(Spin Class Special: 100 dollars)

00:58:32.515 --> 00:58:33.985
(No Caller ID)

00:58:34.025 --> 00:58:35.285
Let's meet up, my friend.

00:58:37.155 --> 00:58:38.155
What?

00:58:38.855 --> 00:58:40.795
(All in Gym for Spinning)

00:58:40.865 --> 00:58:41.865
What was that?

00:58:53.335 --> 00:58:54.945
(Deluxe Taxi)

00:58:59.045 --> 00:59:00.285
What's our defensive strategy for tomorrow?

00:59:00.515 --> 00:59:03.345
We'll block their straight shots and cover the cross-court hits.

00:59:03.415 --> 00:59:05.414
- What about serves? - We'll serve to position two,

00:59:05.415 --> 00:59:06.585
focusing on quick hits and the left.

00:59:06.655 --> 00:59:09.185
- That'll make them easier to mark. - Yes, that should work.

00:59:09.255 --> 00:59:10.295
Seong Uk.

00:59:11.025 --> 00:59:12.694
- Okay, that's a wrap for today. - Yes, Coach.

00:59:12.695 --> 00:59:13.795
- Good practice. - Yes, good work.

00:59:15.225 --> 00:59:16.665
What's this? Showing up unannounced?

00:59:17.965 --> 00:59:20.205
Is Park Min Ho really dead?

00:59:20.565 --> 00:59:22.705
You buried him for good, right?

00:59:31.615 --> 00:59:32.675
Dong Hyeon.

00:59:33.115 --> 00:59:36.545
What is this, all of a sudden? Why ask me about Park Min Ho?

00:59:36.785 --> 00:59:39.084
Hey, you don't get to talk to me like that.

00:59:39.085 --> 00:59:41.225
I even went to prison for you.

00:59:46.655 --> 00:59:47.765
Are you broke?

00:59:50.535 --> 00:59:52.435
(Jingwang University)

00:59:55.565 --> 00:59:56.705
You want me to bury you too?

01:00:04.945 --> 01:00:06.515
Min Ho, where are you going?

01:00:17.455 --> 01:00:18.655
You want me to bury you too?

01:00:20.425 --> 01:00:21.425
Do you?

01:00:28.365 --> 01:00:31.175
Mr. Jang. I think I've found the person...

01:00:31.735 --> 01:00:34.175
Im Dong Hyeon was with on that day 15 years ago.

01:00:34.875 --> 01:00:35.905
You found him?

01:00:36.805 --> 01:00:37.815
Yes.

01:00:40.915 --> 01:00:42.385
I'm looking at him right now.

01:00:55.865 --> 01:00:58.265
Min... Min Ho!

01:01:01.565 --> 01:01:02.705
Min Ho!

01:01:21.785 --> 01:01:22.955
Okay, I got it.

01:01:26.995 --> 01:01:28.265
When did you get here?

01:01:31.865 --> 01:01:33.035
Do you recognize me?

01:01:33.635 --> 01:01:35.105
Of course I do,

01:01:35.435 --> 01:01:36.465
Seong Cheol.

01:01:37.405 --> 01:01:38.505
Someone I'm grateful to.

01:01:41.005 --> 01:01:42.105
Dong Su.

01:01:45.115 --> 01:01:46.575
I found him.

01:01:47.085 --> 01:01:48.115
Sorry?

01:01:49.185 --> 01:01:50.215
But...

01:01:52.485 --> 01:01:53.615
I can't remember.

01:01:56.025 --> 01:01:57.825
No matter how hard I try to remember.

01:01:59.995 --> 01:02:01.025
It's no use.

01:02:07.405 --> 01:02:08.465
Dong Su.

01:02:10.605 --> 01:02:12.705
I know I couldn't help you back then.

01:02:14.605 --> 01:02:16.605
But I think I can now.

01:02:19.075 --> 01:02:20.275
Your son, Park Min Ho.

01:02:21.185 --> 01:02:22.385
I promise...

01:02:23.445 --> 01:02:25.485
I'll find him for you this time.

01:02:41.965 --> 01:02:42.965
Thank you.

01:02:44.535 --> 01:02:45.805
Thank you so much.

01:03:30.585 --> 01:03:33.655
(Taxi Driver 3)

01:03:33.715 --> 01:03:35.585
So, what Dong Su found out...

01:03:36.285 --> 01:03:37.625
was this.

01:03:37.855 --> 01:03:39.195
Mr. Park is in danger.

01:03:40.255 --> 01:03:41.595
Are you sure he's dead?

01:03:42.825 --> 01:03:44.965
- You think you can do it? - Dong Su!

01:03:45.535 --> 01:03:46.535
Help!

01:03:46.536 --> 01:03:48.935
Dong Su. You've done enough.

01:03:49.005 --> 01:03:50.735
I'll take it from here.

01:03:50.775 --> 01:03:52.175
How about we start with some treatment?

01:03:53.275 --> 01:03:54.375
Financial therapy.

01:03:56.005 --> 01:03:59.945
So what matters more than gambling must be a secret you don't want out.

01:04:02.285 --> 01:04:03.285
I found him.

01:04:04.885 --> 01:04:05.955
Park Min Ho.
