Damn it.

00:01:14.304 --> 00:01:15.638
So-hae!

00:01:16.431 --> 00:01:17.891
So-hae!

00:01:21.227 --> 00:01:22.187
So-hae!

00:01:22.687 --> 00:01:24.397
This way. Hurry!

00:01:32.488 --> 00:01:34.240
We're late!

00:01:38.953 --> 00:01:40.121
For God's sake.

00:01:40.622 --> 00:01:41.456
Seriously!

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:42.665
Come on, hurry!

00:01:44.125 --> 00:01:45.043

ANOTHAI AYAMA BORDER PATROL POLICE ACADEMY

00:01:59.474 --> 00:02:00.642
I'll see you later.

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:05.563
How many people?

00:02:08.816 --> 00:02:10.151
Thank you.

00:02:10.235 --> 00:02:12.737
All right, come this way!

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:15.573
Three bottles for a pretty smile!

00:02:17.242 --> 00:02:18.952
No, there won't be enough.

00:02:19.035 --> 00:02:22.038
Two bottles per person. Two bottles!

00:02:22.121 --> 00:02:24.457
Three bottles for a pretty smile!

00:02:26.626 --> 00:02:28.419
Whoa, So-mang!

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.421
Are you wearing makeup?

00:02:30.505 --> 00:02:34.926
Hey, worry about your own face.
It looks rough and dry.

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:37.512
Have you still not used
the lipstick I sent you?

00:02:37.595 --> 00:02:38.972
Oh, that?

00:02:39.472 --> 00:02:41.474
How can I? It's too precious.

00:02:41.557 --> 00:02:45.311
I bought it with the money you sent me,
so just use it as much as you like.

00:02:45.395 --> 00:02:49.399
Yeah, exactly. That money was for you.
Why would you spend it on me?

00:02:49.482 --> 00:02:51.109
Just use it. Please.

00:02:51.192 --> 00:02:52.235
Oh, be quiet.

00:02:52.902 --> 00:02:55.363
How's Dad? How's his back?

00:02:55.446 --> 00:02:57.699
Who knows? If it hurts, he should say so.

00:02:57.782 --> 00:02:59.826
But he never does.

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:01.577
-Hi, So-mang!
-Hey.

00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:03.663
What's this? Are you wearing makeup?

00:03:03.746 --> 00:03:05.915
-Yep.
-Looking good!

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:08.418
You're teasing, aren't you?

00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:11.754
No, I really think you look good. What?

00:03:11.838 --> 00:03:13.840
-Why would you laugh?
-Yeah, you look pretty.

00:03:13.923 --> 00:03:16.509
I swear I'll get you back for this.

00:03:17.552 --> 00:03:21.139
I'll bring her with me
when I go back to Korea next year.

00:03:21.222 --> 00:03:23.641
-Get back at her then.
-What? You laughed too.

00:03:23.725 --> 00:03:25.351
-I said she's pretty.
-Hey, So-mang.

00:03:27.312 --> 00:03:29.564
You look pretty. It looks natural.

00:03:29.647 --> 00:03:30.648
Do you want to say hi?

00:03:30.732 --> 00:03:32.275
-Who is it?
-My sister.

00:03:32.358 --> 00:03:35.403
Hello. I'm Hui-yeong, So-mang's friend.

00:03:35.486 --> 00:03:38.156
So you're my sister's friend. Hi.

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:39.907
-Hi.
-We're in the same class.

00:03:39.991 --> 00:03:41.159
Isn't she cute?

00:03:41.242 --> 00:03:42.910
Yeah, you two play nice.

00:03:43.411 --> 00:03:44.829
I see you've got makeup on too.

00:03:44.912 --> 00:03:45.788
Don't tease her!

00:03:45.872 --> 00:03:48.291
No, I really think she looks pretty.

00:04:02.722 --> 00:04:03.723
Is this her?

00:04:04.891 --> 00:04:06.434
Could you sit up for us real quick?

00:04:06.893 --> 00:04:07.727
Thank you.

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:09.103
Doc.

00:04:09.771 --> 00:04:10.772
It's okay.

00:04:11.522 --> 00:04:12.357
It's okay.

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:16.319
We're seeing a rapid exacerbation
of our COVID patients.

00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:17.945
Dr. Kang!

00:04:18.863 --> 00:04:20.907
-Can you help with their management?
-Okay.

00:04:23.534 --> 00:04:25.119
His saturation is hitting below 70.

00:04:25.203 --> 00:04:27.330
-I'm going to intubate him first.
-Okay.

00:04:32.794 --> 00:04:35.171
Her BP dropped below 80.
One norepinephrine here.

00:04:35.254 --> 00:04:36.214
Okay.

00:04:39.425 --> 00:04:41.594
More COVID patients are coming in!

00:04:42.637 --> 00:04:44.972
Severe patient, this room.
Mild patient, other room.

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:50.061
Listen up, all medical staff! Make sure
you're wearing your PPE properly!

00:05:10.832 --> 00:05:12.500
The water supply hasn't arrived yet.

00:05:12.583 --> 00:05:14.168
Just drink it.

00:05:14.252 --> 00:05:16.963
If you collapse too,
we're going to be in real trouble.

00:05:24.303 --> 00:05:25.346
Are you busy?

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.516
Do you have a minute to talk?

00:05:38.776 --> 00:05:40.069
Call her, even for a second.

00:05:41.821 --> 00:05:44.490
She's all grown up now. She'll understand.

00:06:11.184 --> 00:06:12.477
I don't feel so good.

00:06:13.936 --> 00:06:15.730
So-hae! Are you all right?

00:06:15.813 --> 00:06:16.898
So-hae!

00:06:16.981 --> 00:06:18.649
Help!

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:20.026
So-hae!

00:06:20.109 --> 00:06:21.819
Please help!

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:31.704
So-hae.

00:06:33.247 --> 00:06:34.373

Whatever you do, don't open it.
Please just delete it.

00:07:19.544 --> 00:07:21.963
Those clothes look uncomfy.
Let me take them off.

00:07:22.046 --> 00:07:23.130
Don't.

00:07:23.214 --> 00:07:24.215
Stay still.

00:07:24.715 --> 00:07:25.925
Should I film it?

00:07:26.008 --> 00:07:27.343
-I'm fine.
-Yeah, film it.

00:07:27.426 --> 00:07:28.636
I said stay still.

00:07:29.303 --> 00:07:30.763
-Don't!
-Damn it.

00:07:30.846 --> 00:07:33.432
I said no. Don't!

00:07:34.809 --> 00:07:35.768
No!

00:07:36.477 --> 00:07:37.395
Come closer.

00:07:37.895 --> 00:07:38.938
Keep filming there.

all border checkpoints,
trade facilitation points, and passageways

will be permanently closed.

00:08:28.946 --> 00:08:29.780
Open the door.

00:08:29.864 --> 00:08:32.366
Open the door! Momo, I said open the door!

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:34.160
Open the damn door!

00:08:34.785 --> 00:08:36.746
I told you to open the door!

00:08:36.829 --> 00:08:37.747
Don't.

00:08:38.956 --> 00:08:40.416
Let me out!

00:08:40.499 --> 00:08:41.626
I have to go home!

00:08:41.709 --> 00:08:43.377
Please…

00:08:43.461 --> 00:08:45.087
So-hae, don't do this!

00:08:45.171 --> 00:08:46.839
I have to go back to Korea!

00:08:46.922 --> 00:08:48.883
So-hae, don't be like this.

00:08:48.966 --> 00:08:50.259
-I have to go!
-Stop.

00:08:50.343 --> 00:08:53.304
You know I have to go.

00:08:53.387 --> 00:08:55.848
-Come on. Walk with me.
-You know I have to go!

00:08:56.474 --> 00:08:57.600
I have to go home!

00:08:57.683 --> 00:08:58.517
So-hae!

00:08:58.601 --> 00:09:01.187
No! I have to go back to Korea! Please!

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:03.064
No, I have to go.

00:09:03.147 --> 00:09:04.190
So-hae.

00:09:04.273 --> 00:09:06.400
-I have to go! I have to…
-So-hae!

00:09:45.564 --> 00:09:48.067
I'm sorry, So-mang.

00:09:49.777 --> 00:09:51.278
Then pull yourself together.

00:09:53.322 --> 00:09:55.658
I'm going to kill them all.

00:09:56.575 --> 00:09:59.078
You've got to get up
if you want revenge or whatever.

00:10:06.836 --> 00:10:09.505
I'm sorry, So-mang.

00:10:12.341 --> 00:10:14.969
I'm sorry, So-mang.

00:10:25.438 --> 00:10:26.480
No!

00:10:46.709 --> 00:10:47.585
Guard!

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:50.337
Anyone down there?

00:10:53.758 --> 00:10:54.633
Over here!

00:10:55.176 --> 00:10:56.051
Hurry!

00:11:05.019 --> 00:11:06.061
Open the door!

00:11:06.854 --> 00:11:07.813
Officer!

00:11:11.358 --> 00:11:14.236
I got her! Come on! Hurry!

00:11:15.696 --> 00:11:17.865
Cut her loose! Quickly!

00:11:25.456 --> 00:11:27.291
Call an ambulance! Hurry!

00:11:27.374 --> 00:11:28.209
Yes, ma'am.

00:11:45.434 --> 00:11:47.937
Help me! It hurts!

00:11:49.563 --> 00:11:51.190
The blood vessel has ruptured.

00:11:52.066 --> 00:11:55.069
You have to tie it off
before it retracts into the pelvis.

00:11:55.152 --> 00:11:57.488
Call the hospital,
and get someone here right now!

00:11:57.571 --> 00:11:58.697
-Hurry!
-Yes, ma'am.

00:11:59.198 --> 00:12:00.407
She won't last until then.

00:12:00.491 --> 00:12:01.909
Then what do you want me to do?

00:12:06.747 --> 00:12:09.917
She just tried to kill her,
and you want to put her life in her hands?

00:12:10.709 --> 00:12:13.587
Did you call them? When are they coming?

00:12:13.671 --> 00:12:15.422
It'll be too late if we wait.

00:12:23.389 --> 00:12:24.390
Let her out.

00:12:25.516 --> 00:12:26.517
Yes, ma'am.

00:12:31.021 --> 00:12:32.982
Get me a Kelly, IV fluid, and a splint.

00:12:53.752 --> 00:12:54.837
No.

00:12:55.838 --> 00:12:56.672
I'm scared.

00:12:59.383 --> 00:13:00.843
Get away from me!

00:13:00.926 --> 00:13:02.887
Please tell her to get away from me.

00:13:04.179 --> 00:13:06.599
-Please help me.
-This will hurt a lot.

00:13:08.434 --> 00:13:09.602
Hold her legs down.

00:13:10.102 --> 00:13:11.103
Hold her down.

00:13:11.186 --> 00:13:12.980
Doctor, please assist me.

00:13:13.063 --> 00:13:13.898
Okay.

00:13:17.067 --> 00:13:18.319
Open up the wound, please.

00:13:18.819 --> 00:13:19.820
Shall I ease the pain?

00:13:20.946 --> 00:13:23.282
If her heart rate drops, it'll be riskier.

00:13:23.365 --> 00:13:24.199
I'll start.

00:13:34.251 --> 00:13:35.085
Kelly.

00:13:43.427 --> 00:13:44.553
Hold her tight.

00:13:52.686 --> 00:13:53.812
-Gauze, please.
-Okay.

00:14:07.076 --> 00:14:08.243
What is that?

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:13.832
Isn't that Baek's car?

00:14:13.916 --> 00:14:14.917
It's Prosecutor Baek.

00:14:15.417 --> 00:14:17.252
That kid could've lived. Man.

00:14:36.939 --> 00:14:38.399
Prosecutor Baek, you made it.

00:15:24.028 --> 00:15:25.154
You're here.

00:15:27.322 --> 00:15:30.200
Sir, your desk got moved back
to the third floor yesterday.

00:15:30.743 --> 00:15:32.119
Now that I work for you again,

00:15:32.202 --> 00:15:34.413
I get to be at a crime scene
past midnight.

00:15:34.496 --> 00:15:36.248
Have you checked nearby CCTV cameras?

00:15:37.332 --> 00:15:38.709
We're securing them now.

00:15:40.294 --> 00:15:41.670
She seems to have been

00:15:42.171 --> 00:15:44.089
in a fight before she fled.

00:15:44.173 --> 00:15:47.342
It looks like she was in a hurry.
She left her wallet and card behind.

00:15:56.727 --> 00:15:57.936
What is all this?

00:16:20.334 --> 00:16:21.460
Sir, could you…

00:16:23.462 --> 00:16:25.589
KO SE-HUN'S TRAVEL ROUTE

00:16:25.672 --> 00:16:26.632
The 4th.

00:16:27.674 --> 00:16:28.675
The 6th.

00:16:30.928 --> 00:16:32.971
"I hope he deserves to die."

00:16:40.979 --> 00:16:42.356
Come take a look at this!

00:16:44.483 --> 00:16:45.734
Take all these with you.

00:17:14.596 --> 00:17:16.723
Do you think this can be restored?

00:17:23.105 --> 00:17:25.107
She already got rid of the memory card.

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:27.860
Even if there's data left on the device,
it won't be easy.

00:17:41.456 --> 00:17:43.709
Hello, this is Prosecutor Baek Dong-hun.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:46.962
Can you please issue a search warrant?

00:17:47.504 --> 00:17:49.548
Yes, right now.
We'll be executing it tonight.

00:18:02.019 --> 00:18:03.353
You can move her now.

00:18:08.483 --> 00:18:11.695
They'll ask about the initial treatment
at the hospital.

00:18:11.778 --> 00:18:14.698
It'd be better
if Inmate 407 went with you instead of me.

00:18:19.578 --> 00:18:20.537
Let's go.

00:18:25.834 --> 00:18:26.668
Come on.

00:18:50.859 --> 00:18:52.319
At least wipe your face.

00:19:04.665 --> 00:19:05.874
I'm starting anesthesia now.

00:19:07.668 --> 00:19:10.754
She was already bleeding heavily
from an open femoral fracture,

00:19:10.837 --> 00:19:12.631
so I realigned the femur first.

00:19:13.131 --> 00:19:16.969
Then I clamped the end of the vessel
with a Kelly to reduce the bleeding.

00:19:17.052 --> 00:19:20.722
Her vitals were unstable,
so I didn't give her any pain relief.

00:19:21.348 --> 00:19:24.851
So you performed the procedure yourself,
not the medical officer?

00:19:25.352 --> 00:19:26.186
Yes.

00:19:27.229 --> 00:19:28.730
And you've done it before?

00:19:29.523 --> 00:19:30.357
Yes.

00:19:35.821 --> 00:19:38.407
JUNGDONG GENERAL HOSPITAL

00:19:42.494 --> 00:19:43.578
Get some rest.

00:19:44.371 --> 00:19:46.957
We'll be staying
until we know how the surgery went.

00:19:51.336 --> 00:19:52.504
Ms. Eom, here you go.

00:19:53.547 --> 00:19:54.381
Thank you.

00:20:10.314 --> 00:20:13.400
JANG JEONG-GU LAW OFFICE

00:20:14.818 --> 00:20:16.028
Seriously…

00:20:20.198 --> 00:20:23.702
Isn't this a violation
of my client's rights?

00:20:23.785 --> 00:20:25.787
Do you really need to go this far?

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:27.914
That's what I want to ask.

00:20:27.998 --> 00:20:30.667
What were you doing
until things got to this point?

00:20:33.837 --> 00:20:36.840
While you were going around
claiming An Yun-su's innocence,

00:20:36.923 --> 00:20:40.510
she was planning to murder Ko Se-hun.

00:20:41.845 --> 00:20:43.347
And now the kid's dead.

00:20:47.768 --> 00:20:49.936
An Yun-su contacted you, didn't she?

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:51.396
When was it?

00:20:58.987 --> 00:21:00.739
This was the last message from her.

00:21:00.822 --> 00:21:01.990
I'M TERMINATING YOUR SERVICES

00:21:02.074 --> 00:21:03.575
She hasn't been taking my calls since.

00:21:06.495 --> 00:21:09.956
You still believe she's innocent,
don't you?

00:21:10.791 --> 00:21:12.751
I haven't heard her side of the story yet.

00:21:12.834 --> 00:21:15.337
Did it ever occur to you
that she's just been using you?

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:17.130
That's why attorneys exist.

00:21:17.214 --> 00:21:19.466
To be used in the client's best interest.

00:21:27.891 --> 00:21:29.142
Can I go out for a smoke?

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:49.037
Hello?

00:21:51.164 --> 00:21:51.998
Hello?

00:21:52.833 --> 00:21:54.126
This is An Yun-su.

00:21:58.046 --> 00:22:00.173
The office rent?

00:22:01.383 --> 00:22:04.344
I told your son I'd be taking on his case
in return for it.

00:22:04.845 --> 00:22:06.805
Yes, it's all in the contract.

00:22:06.888 --> 00:22:10.016
We signed the contract
under that agreement.

00:22:10.517 --> 00:22:11.518
Yes.

00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:17.858
Are you all right?

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:23.029
For now.

00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:25.866
I know you don't trust me,

00:22:25.949 --> 00:22:28.034
but you're all I've got right now.

00:22:31.204 --> 00:22:32.706
Please go see Mo Eun.

00:22:32.789 --> 00:22:36.376
It's not wise to get mixed up with her.
People will only get suspicious.

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:38.503
She knows I didn't do it.

00:22:39.004 --> 00:22:41.423
And she knew Ko Se-hun was dead
before I did.

00:22:41.506 --> 00:22:44.885
I don't know what it is she knows,
but I have to know now.

00:22:45.427 --> 00:22:46.428
Do you trust Mo Eun?

00:22:47.345 --> 00:22:50.307
Even if I were to meet her, we don't know

00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:51.850
whether she'll help you.

00:22:51.933 --> 00:22:53.059
Please do this for me.

00:22:55.187 --> 00:22:56.104
-But, Ms. An…
-Sir.

00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:02.444
Mo Eun was taken
to the hospital again today.

00:23:02.944 --> 00:23:04.362
Not because she was hurt,

00:23:04.446 --> 00:23:07.032
but an inmate had an accident
and was seriously injured.

00:23:07.532 --> 00:23:11.369
Mo Eun provided emergency care,
so she followed them to Jungdong Hospital.

00:23:11.453 --> 00:23:12.496
Hold on.

00:23:13.246 --> 00:23:14.581
Who was that just now?

00:23:18.293 --> 00:23:19.377
My landlord.

00:23:34.392 --> 00:23:36.478
-Check this number.
-Okay.

00:23:36.561 --> 00:23:37.729
Seriously?

00:23:46.154 --> 00:23:48.990
031-026-5794. Run this number for me.

00:23:53.745 --> 00:23:55.539
They say it's from a payphone nearby.

00:24:09.553 --> 00:24:11.096
What did An Yun-su say?

00:24:14.683 --> 00:24:16.309
What did you talk about?

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:25.735
Deploy officers in the area.

00:24:25.819 --> 00:24:29.489
Stop and check every single passerby,
bus, and taxi. Nothing gets past us.

00:25:17.871 --> 00:25:19.706
Hello. Is she all right?

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:22.500
She's fine. She's not hurt.

00:25:24.544 --> 00:25:26.546
I'd like to talk to her. Is that possible?

00:25:28.006 --> 00:25:28.840
Alone?

00:25:29.424 --> 00:25:31.384
Yes, I'd appreciate it.

00:25:32.302 --> 00:25:33.970
Go ahead. I'll be outside.

00:25:34.054 --> 00:25:34.971
Thank you.

00:25:42.395 --> 00:25:46.191
If you're here to withdraw as my lawyer,
you could've waited until morning.

00:25:47.067 --> 00:25:49.027
I'll admit I've been troubled.

00:25:52.072 --> 00:25:53.490
Why didn't you tell me?

00:25:56.743 --> 00:25:58.161
There's a lot I've left out.

00:26:02.207 --> 00:26:04.167
Ms. An called her lawyer.

00:26:04.751 --> 00:26:06.753
There's something she wants to know.

00:26:07.671 --> 00:26:11.049
She said you know
she didn't kill Ko Se-hun.

00:26:11.549 --> 00:26:13.718
And that you knew he was dead

00:26:14.678 --> 00:26:17.180
before anyone else did.

00:26:19.391 --> 00:26:22.268
Do you really know something
that we don't?

00:26:27.482 --> 00:26:28.775
Her lawyer said

00:26:29.526 --> 00:26:31.277
he saw Ms. An at the hospital

00:26:32.445 --> 00:26:34.364
the day Ko Se-hun's body was found.

00:26:37.075 --> 00:26:37.951
You two met, right?

00:26:41.037 --> 00:26:43.289
If you know something, please tell me.

00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:45.792
If An Yun-su isn't the killer,

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.670
someone should help her.

00:26:51.756 --> 00:26:52.716
Ms. Mo.

00:26:52.799 --> 00:26:53.717
Ms. Mo!

00:26:57.053 --> 00:26:58.680
Inmate 407.

00:27:00.807 --> 00:27:01.641
It's fine.

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:24.789
Well…

00:27:26.082 --> 00:27:27.333
I got thirsty.

00:27:29.502 --> 00:27:31.713
-Ms. Mo.
-Yun-su must be mistaken.

00:27:32.422 --> 00:27:33.465
I'm sorry?

00:27:35.049 --> 00:27:36.509
Just tell her that.

00:27:45.018 --> 00:27:46.227
The surgery went well.

00:27:47.312 --> 00:27:49.522
She survived
due to the on-scene emergency care.

00:27:51.107 --> 00:27:52.108
Inmate 407,

00:27:52.192 --> 00:27:53.902
you saved her life.

00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:57.697
Guess it just wasn't her time.

00:28:00.617 --> 00:28:02.368
Have you finished talking to her?

00:28:02.952 --> 00:28:03.828
Yes.

00:28:04.621 --> 00:28:06.122
Then we should head back.

00:28:06.748 --> 00:28:07.832
Ms. Eom.

00:28:09.709 --> 00:28:11.461
Can I take a shower before we go?

00:28:12.003 --> 00:28:14.672
JUNGDONG GENERAL HOSPITAL

00:28:19.093 --> 00:28:20.470
You're showering too?

00:28:23.598 --> 00:28:24.432
Get in.

00:28:35.401 --> 00:28:36.611
Put these on afterward.

00:29:03.096 --> 00:29:04.848
I'm not sure if you're reckless

00:29:05.431 --> 00:29:07.058
or if you're impressive.

00:29:24.284 --> 00:29:26.202
If you know something, please tell me.

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:29.455
If An Yun-su isn't the killer,

00:29:30.707 --> 00:29:32.000
someone should help her.

00:29:33.334 --> 00:29:34.544
Inmate 407!

00:29:36.671 --> 00:29:37.505
It's fine.

00:30:02.071 --> 00:30:03.698
I've become a murderer again.

00:30:03.781 --> 00:30:05.116
Was it your doing?

00:30:08.411 --> 00:30:11.205
Are you asking
if there was someone else besides you?

00:30:11.706 --> 00:30:12.582
No, there wasn't.

00:30:12.665 --> 00:30:14.208
If there was another way,

00:30:14.292 --> 00:30:17.420
I wouldn't have depended
on someone too soft like you.

00:30:18.504 --> 00:30:20.882
I thought killing Ko Se-hun
would be no problem,

00:30:21.424 --> 00:30:23.551
knowing how much you care
about your daughter.

00:30:25.261 --> 00:30:28.139
Killing someone might be easy for you,
but not for me.

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:30.308
I didn't kill anyone. So why am I--

00:30:30.391 --> 00:30:31.351
This is

00:30:32.936 --> 00:30:35.271
just like when you were in prison.

00:30:37.231 --> 00:30:39.692
Having a fit won't change anything.

00:30:45.615 --> 00:30:47.116
What is it that you know?

00:30:48.701 --> 00:30:50.536
You said you saw a photo.

00:30:51.245 --> 00:30:53.873
That's how you knew Ko Se-hun was killed,
and not by me.

00:30:55.625 --> 00:30:58.211
Tell me everything you remember.

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:13.893
Ko Se-hun

00:31:15.353 --> 00:31:17.647
got what he deserved.

00:31:18.398 --> 00:31:21.025
And I etched his final moment in my mind

00:31:21.109 --> 00:31:22.944
so I can clearly remember.

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:27.407
There's Ko Se-hun
in the center of the photo, dead.

00:31:27.907 --> 00:31:30.076
He's on a brown leather couch.

00:31:31.869 --> 00:31:34.080
His head is tilted to the left,

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:37.333
and a knife is lodged
in the right side of his neck.

00:31:38.334 --> 00:31:40.878
Its black handle is sticking out,

00:31:41.421 --> 00:31:43.756
as if he's grown a horn on his neck.

00:31:45.174 --> 00:31:46.884
There's a tall window behind him,

00:31:47.802 --> 00:31:50.930
and a streetlamp
is glowing yellow outside.

00:31:53.933 --> 00:31:55.977
Someone sent me this.

00:32:01.399 --> 00:32:03.067
Do you know who sent that photo?

00:32:03.568 --> 00:32:05.445
At first, I thought it was you.

00:32:05.528 --> 00:32:06.446
Then I thought,

00:32:06.988 --> 00:32:09.949
"Someone must've sent this photo
pretending to be you."

00:32:10.033 --> 00:32:13.828
What I needed to ask
was not who sent it, but why.

00:32:13.911 --> 00:32:17.749
Why did they send me that photo
pretending to be you?

00:32:18.249 --> 00:32:22.378
Why were they waiting for you
to kill Ko Se-hun?

00:32:22.879 --> 00:32:27.341
And how did they know
we were planning to kill him?

00:32:30.928 --> 00:32:32.096
Wrap it up now.

00:32:34.891 --> 00:32:35.808
Don't…

00:32:37.852 --> 00:32:39.020
trust anyone.

00:32:51.157 --> 00:32:52.867
Since you got in here safely,

00:32:54.494 --> 00:32:55.870
I presume you can get out too.

00:33:03.586 --> 00:33:04.587
Be careful.

00:33:34.283 --> 00:33:35.743
Why didn't she get changed?

00:33:36.786 --> 00:33:37.620
Let's go.

00:33:54.137 --> 00:33:55.304
Fucking hell.

00:33:58.182 --> 00:33:59.517
Inmate 407!

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:00.726
Stop right there!

00:34:04.438 --> 00:34:05.523
Out of the way!

00:34:05.606 --> 00:34:06.816
Inmate 407!

00:34:10.361 --> 00:34:11.404
Are you okay?

00:34:11.487 --> 00:34:13.698
Get her!

00:34:18.452 --> 00:34:19.662
Hey, get her!

00:34:19.745 --> 00:34:21.080
-407!
-407!

00:34:21.581 --> 00:34:22.415
Hey!

00:34:22.915 --> 00:34:24.417
-Officer Kang, that way!
-Okay.

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:27.378
Get her!

00:34:30.798 --> 00:34:31.924
What's going on?

00:34:32.675 --> 00:34:34.927
-Damn it.
-407!

00:34:39.223 --> 00:34:40.141
Did you see that?

00:35:28.189 --> 00:35:30.483
Inmate 407 just entered
the basement kitchen.

00:35:30.566 --> 00:35:32.902
Block all exits here
and the way to the parking lot.

00:35:32.985 --> 00:35:34.445
Send all officers this way.

00:36:25.705 --> 00:36:29.041
…please come
to the radiology department immediately.

00:36:39.093 --> 00:36:39.927
Yes.

00:36:51.397 --> 00:36:52.231
Yes.

00:37:27.350 --> 00:37:29.435
I walked right into a dead end.

00:37:30.019 --> 00:37:31.062
Shut up.

00:37:36.359 --> 00:37:37.443
Hands up and kneel.

00:38:11.811 --> 00:38:14.230
When my son and daughter-in-law died,

00:38:15.022 --> 00:38:17.108
I tried to accept it.

00:38:18.317 --> 00:38:20.611
Because I knew what they did.

00:38:21.654 --> 00:38:24.532
I thought it was divine punishment
from the heavens.

00:38:26.951 --> 00:38:28.744
But still, you should've shown

00:38:29.495 --> 00:38:31.455
mercy to the child.

00:38:33.499 --> 00:38:34.792
He'd lost his parents.

00:38:36.043 --> 00:38:38.421
That was enough punishment.

00:38:41.882 --> 00:38:45.177
My only regret is that I didn't get
to kill him with my own hands…

00:38:48.514 --> 00:38:50.182
in front of his parents.

00:39:17.126 --> 00:39:19.420
You should've forgiven the child.

00:39:39.315 --> 00:39:40.733
112, emergency services.

00:39:44.403 --> 00:39:45.404
Hello?

00:39:47.948 --> 00:39:50.117
Are you in danger right now?

00:39:50.618 --> 00:39:52.077
Please help me.

00:39:53.245 --> 00:39:55.289
Can you tell me your location?

00:39:58.292 --> 00:39:59.168
Hello?

00:40:00.794 --> 00:40:01.795
Ma'am?

00:40:03.797 --> 00:40:06.425
Don't hang up. I'll track your location.

00:44:47.664 --> 00:44:52.669
