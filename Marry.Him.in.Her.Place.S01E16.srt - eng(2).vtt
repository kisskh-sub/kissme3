00:01:26.272 --> 00:01:27.272
Go ahead.

00:01:36.832 --> 00:01:38.472
Mr. Li, how have you been lately?

00:01:38.992 --> 00:01:39.791
Quite well.

00:01:39.792 --> 00:01:41.272
Thank you for asking.

00:01:42.152 --> 00:01:43.272
Madam Lin.

00:01:47.912 --> 00:01:49.432
Chief Song.

00:01:49.912 --> 00:01:52.792
Why didn't Madam Lin greet the hosts

00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:54.992
of today's banquet?

00:01:55.472 --> 00:01:56.712
Afraid of me?

00:02:00.792 --> 00:02:03.432
Chief Song, you hold my secret
in your hands.

00:02:03.792 --> 00:02:05.472
Of course, I'm afraid.

00:02:07.352 --> 00:02:08.592
Madam Lin.

00:02:09.072 --> 00:02:10.432
Listen to my advice.

00:02:11.272 --> 00:02:13.431
Before you act or make decisions,

00:02:13.432 --> 00:02:15.832
it's best to leave yourself a way out.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.130
Otherwise, if your backers fall,

00:02:18.312 --> 00:02:19.792
you might lose your life.

00:02:21.487 --> 00:02:23.367
Thanks for your concern, Chief Song,

00:02:23.872 --> 00:02:26.872
but you better save this advice
for yourself.

00:02:27.112 --> 00:02:29.032
There are many guests today.

00:02:29.352 --> 00:02:32.432
If anything embarrassing happens,

00:02:32.987 --> 00:02:38.547
I wonder if Chief Song
will still remain as calm as now.

00:02:46.112 --> 00:02:47.774
Chief Song, ignoring your own wife

00:02:47.775 --> 00:02:49.591
and all these merchants,

00:02:49.592 --> 00:02:52.524
chatting so happily with my wife here,

00:02:52.525 --> 00:02:56.045
shows you really haven't taken
Mayor Song's words to heart.

00:02:56.272 --> 00:02:58.324
We've known each other for years.

00:02:58.325 --> 00:03:00.271
Your overprotective behavior
for your wife

00:03:00.272 --> 00:03:03.512
really opens my eyes.

00:03:04.672 --> 00:03:05.951
Alright.

00:03:05.952 --> 00:03:08.392
Then I wish you both
a wonderful time today.

00:03:25.192 --> 00:03:27.072
Guang, go.

00:03:28.592 --> 00:03:29.712
Mother.

00:03:29.832 --> 00:03:31.591
Madam Song already has children.

00:03:31.592 --> 00:03:33.111
This wealthy family is such a mess.

00:03:33.112 --> 00:03:34.792
Why are you here?

00:03:38.392 --> 00:03:39.752
Take him away.

00:03:40.625 --> 00:03:41.705
Wait.

00:03:47.712 --> 00:03:49.312
Chief Song.

00:03:49.552 --> 00:03:52.071
Mr. Lu and his son were brought by me.

00:03:52.072 --> 00:03:53.512
What do you mean by this?

00:03:55.872 --> 00:03:58.151
So it was Mr. Lin who brought them.

00:03:58.152 --> 00:03:59.751
I thought they were bothering my wife.

00:03:59.752 --> 00:04:01.899
I thought they were here
to cause trouble.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.139
What a coincidence.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.511
Mr. Lu asked me to find someone for him.

00:04:05.512 --> 00:04:06.951
Looks like I found them.

00:04:06.952 --> 00:04:09.352
Mr. Lin, found them.

00:04:09.752 --> 00:04:11.352
She's the one I was looking for.

00:04:11.412 --> 00:04:14.432
You're lying. I don't even know you.

00:04:15.937 --> 00:04:17.427
What a scoundrel.

00:04:18.937 --> 00:04:19.832
Father.

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.449
You, Lu Man.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.969
You lied to me
about making money in the city.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.929
Turns out you were climbing
the social ladder.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.191
Our child is already this big.

00:04:33.192 --> 00:04:34.986
You, a married woman,

00:04:34.987 --> 00:04:37.991
actually did something so shameless.

00:04:37.992 --> 00:04:40.831
If my mother hadn't taken
in a lonely and helpless you back then,

00:04:40.832 --> 00:04:42.871
you wouldn't have the life you have now.

00:04:42.872 --> 00:04:44.112
Everyone,

00:04:44.712 --> 00:04:46.199
help me judge this.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.760
Is there anyone who bullies
their husband like this?

00:04:51.352 --> 00:04:52.592
Guang.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.874
Take a good look.

00:04:54.875 --> 00:04:56.711
Your mother doesn't want us anymore.

00:04:56.712 --> 00:04:58.152
Mother.

00:04:58.512 --> 00:05:00.191
Mother.

00:05:00.192 --> 00:05:02.391
Guang, don't listen to him.

00:05:02.392 --> 00:05:03.899
I don't mean that.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.951
How could Miss Liang have such
a big child?

00:05:06.952 --> 00:05:08.351
There's something fishy here.

00:05:08.352 --> 00:05:09.831
Isn't she Miss Liang?

00:05:09.832 --> 00:05:11.391
Why is she called Lu Man?

00:05:11.392 --> 00:05:13.792
Could it be that she cheated
on Chief Song?

00:05:18.192 --> 00:05:20.871
(Now let's see how you explain this.)

00:05:20.872 --> 00:05:22.592
Zhichu.

00:05:27.672 --> 00:05:28.912
What's going on?

00:05:33.112 --> 00:05:34.272
Come in.

00:05:35.592 --> 00:05:36.672
(Uncle Er.)

00:05:37.792 --> 00:05:38.711
Mayor Song.

00:05:38.712 --> 00:05:39.711
There's something

00:05:39.712 --> 00:05:41.791
Liang family has hidden this
from you too long.

00:05:41.792 --> 00:05:44.271
It's been weighing on my conscience.

00:05:44.272 --> 00:05:46.031
Today I must reveal it

00:05:46.032 --> 00:05:47.391
to the public.

00:05:47.392 --> 00:05:50.311
Liang Yi went missing
for two years at sixteen.

00:05:50.312 --> 00:05:50.991
Back then,

00:05:50.992 --> 00:05:53.791
my eldest brother took Liang Yi
out of town for business,

00:05:53.792 --> 00:05:56.391
but unexpectedly, she got lost.

00:05:56.392 --> 00:05:58.271
Back then my eldest brother was frantic.

00:05:58.272 --> 00:05:59.391
He searched everywhere.

00:05:59.392 --> 00:06:00.831
He searched for over a year.

00:06:00.832 --> 00:06:02.031
He finally found her.

00:06:02.032 --> 00:06:05.071
But unexpectedly,
it was already too late.

00:06:05.072 --> 00:06:07.124
The Lu family had bought her
and taken her.

00:06:07.125 --> 00:06:08.791
She even had a child.

00:06:08.792 --> 00:06:10.591
My eldest brother was heartbroken,

00:06:10.592 --> 00:06:11.991
in deep anguish.

00:06:11.992 --> 00:06:14.351
But family disgrace shouldn't
be made public.

00:06:14.352 --> 00:06:17.431
So he hid this part of her past.

00:06:17.432 --> 00:06:19.111
Besides, my brother truly

00:06:19.112 --> 00:06:21.751
cherished the marriage arranged
between Liang Yi and Zhichu.

00:06:21.752 --> 00:06:22.951
He was confused at the time

00:06:22.952 --> 00:06:24.271
and concealed the truth.

00:06:24.272 --> 00:06:27.071
In the end, he still decided to marry
Liang Yi into the Song family.

00:06:27.072 --> 00:06:28.191
Mayor Song,

00:06:28.192 --> 00:06:29.471
please be magnanimous.

00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:31.271
Considering my brother has passed away,

00:06:31.272 --> 00:06:32.271
I beg your forgiveness.

00:06:32.272 --> 00:06:33.674
If there's any blame, put it on me.

00:06:33.675 --> 00:06:34.751
I'll take it all.

00:06:34.752 --> 00:06:35.511
Mayor Song,

00:06:35.512 --> 00:06:37.511
Liang family has wronged you.

00:06:37.512 --> 00:06:39.152
We have wronged you.

00:06:40.152 --> 00:06:41.071
What are you doing?

00:06:41.072 --> 00:06:43.471
I won't allow them
to slander me like this.

00:06:43.472 --> 00:06:44.471
Turning truth into lies.

00:06:44.472 --> 00:06:46.391
In what identity are you stepping out?

00:06:46.392 --> 00:06:47.512
Xu Yin?

00:06:48.062 --> 00:06:49.502
Or Liang Yi?

00:07:03.072 --> 00:07:04.592
I sincerely apologize

00:07:05.232 --> 00:07:07.031
for making everyone witness this.

00:07:07.032 --> 00:07:08.712
Regarding today's incident,

00:07:08.912 --> 00:07:13.151
I hope everyone can understand
the hardship behind it.

00:07:13.152 --> 00:07:14.672
Do not speak carelessly.

00:07:16.272 --> 00:07:18.231
Take all of them back.

00:07:18.232 --> 00:07:21.191
This matter is extremely serious.

00:07:21.192 --> 00:07:23.712
I will interrogate it personally.

00:07:25.272 --> 00:07:26.432
Mayor Song.

00:07:28.832 --> 00:07:31.431
Mr. Lu and Guang were brought by me.

00:07:31.432 --> 00:07:33.871
Besides, they are also victims.

00:07:33.872 --> 00:07:35.632
Please allow them to leave.

00:07:36.462 --> 00:07:37.471
How about this?

00:07:37.472 --> 00:07:40.231
If you need the father
and son to testify,

00:07:40.232 --> 00:07:42.111
just tell me.

00:07:42.112 --> 00:07:44.912
I will personally bring them
to your residence.

00:07:45.592 --> 00:07:47.392
Then I'll trouble you.

00:07:52.712 --> 00:07:58.192
(So the one who really betrayed
my father was Uncle Er.)

00:07:58.312 --> 00:08:02.152
You thought capturing the Lu father
and son would give me leverage.

00:08:03.325 --> 00:08:04.964
Trying to fight me?

00:08:04.965 --> 00:08:06.445
Too naive.

00:08:13.912 --> 00:08:16.151
Xiazhu. I missed you so much.
Give me a kiss.

00:08:16.152 --> 00:08:17.032
No.

00:08:17.612 --> 00:08:18.551
So pretentious.

00:08:18.552 --> 00:08:19.712
Come on, give me a kiss.

00:08:20.832 --> 00:08:21.752
Pretentious.

00:08:23.112 --> 00:08:24.071
Xiaojiao.

00:08:24.072 --> 00:08:24.631
Don't leave.

00:08:24.632 --> 00:08:25.791
Wait a moment.

00:08:25.792 --> 00:08:27.152
Wait for me.

00:08:32.312 --> 00:08:33.391
Is everything ready?

00:08:33.392 --> 00:08:34.336
Don't worry.

00:08:34.337 --> 00:08:35.195
Good.

00:08:38.032 --> 00:08:39.832
Second Master has great tolerance
for alcohol.

00:08:42.432 --> 00:08:43.712
Good wine.

00:08:46.312 --> 00:08:48.191
Qiushuang, you smell wonderful.

00:08:48.192 --> 00:08:48.631
Come.

00:08:48.632 --> 00:08:50.112
Let me kiss you.

00:08:50.412 --> 00:08:51.651
Second Master,

00:08:51.652 --> 00:08:53.332
let me toast you again.

00:08:56.672 --> 00:08:57.751
Your skin is so fair.

00:08:57.752 --> 00:08:59.032
So smooth.

00:09:01.262 --> 00:09:02.111
Qiushuang.

00:09:02.112 --> 00:09:04.552
I will be gentle later.

00:09:08.752 --> 00:09:10.832
You really can drink.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.740
Good wine.

00:09:16.272 --> 00:09:17.792
Fill it up.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.900
Second Master.

00:09:29.475 --> 00:09:30.995
Is this drug reliable?

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.191
Don't worry, Madam Lin.

00:09:33.192 --> 00:09:36.551
When he wakes up, he'll feel weak
and drenched in cold sweat.

00:09:36.552 --> 00:09:39.191
Just like being possessed
by something evil.

00:09:39.192 --> 00:09:40.751
I've cleared the area.

00:09:40.752 --> 00:09:43.031
Ask anything you need.

00:09:43.032 --> 00:09:44.152
Thank you.

00:09:59.687 --> 00:10:00.967
Someone come!

00:10:02.352 --> 00:10:03.872
Is anyone there?

00:10:04.752 --> 00:10:06.151
Qiushuang!

00:10:06.152 --> 00:10:07.672
Someone come!

00:10:31.552 --> 00:10:32.551
Amitabha.

00:10:32.552 --> 00:10:35.351
Buddha, please protect me.

00:10:35.352 --> 00:10:38.232
Return my life to me!

00:10:38.472 --> 00:10:40.871
I died so miserably!

00:10:40.872 --> 00:10:42.432
Uncle Er.

00:10:43.792 --> 00:10:44.511
You...

00:10:44.512 --> 00:10:45.711
You are...

00:10:45.712 --> 00:10:46.831
Liang Yi?

00:10:46.832 --> 00:10:48.471
Uncle Er.

00:10:48.472 --> 00:10:50.111
Where is my father?

00:10:50.112 --> 00:10:52.220
Why can't I find him?

00:10:53.512 --> 00:10:55.591
Your father...
Hasn't he already passed away?

00:10:55.592 --> 00:10:56.591
Impossible.

00:10:56.592 --> 00:10:58.712
How could my father be dead?

00:10:58.992 --> 00:11:00.671
It's true. I'm not lying.

00:11:00.672 --> 00:11:03.472
Your father had already died
on your wedding day.

00:11:03.712 --> 00:11:05.391
Every injustice has a culprit.

00:11:05.392 --> 00:11:07.680
If you have matters, don't come to me.
Don't come to me.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:08.391
Go to Song Zhichu.

00:11:08.392 --> 00:11:09.592
Go to Song Zhichu.

00:11:15.352 --> 00:11:17.912
Why did Song Zhichu kill my father?

00:11:19.632 --> 00:11:20.551
Because...

00:11:20.552 --> 00:11:21.360
Say it.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.219
Because your father discovered
that Song Zhichu

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.351
and I were secretly
using the Liang family

00:11:25.352 --> 00:11:27.551
to transport opium.

00:11:27.552 --> 00:11:29.351
He wanted to report us to Song Ming.

00:11:29.352 --> 00:11:30.591
I acted to protect myself,

00:11:30.592 --> 00:11:32.791
and quickly informed Song Zhichu.

00:11:32.792 --> 00:11:35.031
Who knew Song Zhichu
would be so ruthless?

00:11:35.032 --> 00:11:37.631
He's too cruel.

00:11:37.632 --> 00:11:39.031
He even killed his father-in-law.

00:11:39.032 --> 00:11:42.831
So you also perjured yourself
for him against your conscience.

00:11:42.832 --> 00:11:44.471
Calling black white.

00:11:44.472 --> 00:11:46.031
I had no choice.

00:11:46.032 --> 00:11:46.791
You know,

00:11:46.792 --> 00:11:47.711
Song Zhichu

00:11:47.712 --> 00:11:48.711
is madman.

00:11:48.712 --> 00:11:49.831
He is ruthless.

00:11:49.832 --> 00:11:52.791
Did Song Ming know about you
and Song Zhichu transporting opium?

00:11:52.792 --> 00:11:54.191
There's no way he could know.

00:11:54.192 --> 00:11:56.271
He is the mayor.

00:11:56.272 --> 00:11:58.391
Moreover, the anti-opium campaign
in Rong City

00:11:58.392 --> 00:12:01.192
was your father
and Song Ming's joint effort.

00:12:03.352 --> 00:12:05.449
I've said all I can.

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:09.111
Go back to where you came from.

00:12:09.112 --> 00:12:12.551
I will make sure to send you more money
so that your life there is well-provided.

00:12:12.552 --> 00:12:14.832
Alright?

00:12:15.032 --> 00:12:17.872
I already old. I can't take much fright.

00:12:24.175 --> 00:12:25.711
Sign this confession.

00:12:25.712 --> 00:12:26.236
No.

00:12:26.237 --> 00:12:28.231
Song Zhichu...

00:12:28.232 --> 00:12:29.031
He will kill me.

00:12:29.032 --> 00:12:30.191
I'll be dead.

00:12:30.192 --> 00:12:31.271
If you don't sign,

00:12:31.272 --> 00:12:34.151
I'll take you to the underworld
to see my father

00:12:34.152 --> 00:12:36.871
and make you suffer
in hell for eternity.

00:12:36.872 --> 00:12:38.431
You won't die a good death.

00:12:38.432 --> 00:12:41.895
I'll sign.

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:48.932
(The sinner)

00:12:51.472 --> 00:12:53.311
Uncle Er,

00:12:53.312 --> 00:12:55.831
I will haunt you forever.

00:12:55.832 --> 00:12:59.112
You'll never be rid of me in your life.

00:13:00.072 --> 00:13:04.191
I want you to pay with your life.

00:13:04.192 --> 00:13:05.792
No!

00:13:30.552 --> 00:13:31.831
There...

00:13:31.832 --> 00:13:33.352
There's a ghost!

00:13:33.712 --> 00:13:35.152
There's a ghost!

00:13:55.032 --> 00:13:56.791
Making him confess is simple.

00:13:56.792 --> 00:13:59.151
Why torture yourself like this?

00:13:59.152 --> 00:14:01.871
Why can brothers use each other

00:14:01.872 --> 00:14:03.791
and scheme against each other?

00:14:03.792 --> 00:14:06.751
When my father was alive,
he treated Uncle Er well.

00:14:06.752 --> 00:14:09.712
And yet he could betray like this.

00:14:10.432 --> 00:14:13.311
(I really didn't expect Miss Liang
to be alive.)

00:14:13.312 --> 00:14:16.952
(If I tell Chief Song about this...)

00:14:21.432 --> 00:14:24.232
Is there really no karma in this world?

00:14:31.152 --> 00:14:32.312
If not,

00:14:35.272 --> 00:14:37.712
I will fight for justice on your behalf.
