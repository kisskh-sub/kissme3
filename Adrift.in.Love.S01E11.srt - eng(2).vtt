WEBVTT

00:00:01.875 --> 00:00:02.878
Look.

00:00:02.878 --> 00:00:05.596
This is a painting my dad bought at Christie's.

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:10.051
Yayoi Kusama.

00:00:10.051 --> 00:00:11.428
It can't be cheap, can it?

00:00:11.428 --> 00:00:13.229
Over a million US dollars.

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.769
But compared to private sales,
this is a pretty good price.

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:23.106
A friend once asked me
to invest in art, but I didn't.

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:25.150
Now that I think about it,
if I had invested with him,

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.368
I could have earned ten to twenty times more.

00:00:28.145 --> 00:00:30.238
All right, let's finish this up quickly.

00:00:30.238 --> 00:00:33.033
I really don't want to see tomorrow's sun.

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:35.243
Not the sun, the sunrise.

00:00:35.243 --> 00:00:37.294
Okay, where were we?

00:00:38.913 --> 00:00:39.914
What are you doing?

00:00:39.914 --> 00:00:42.250
I've been sitting too long,
so I'm moving my limbs.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.918
If you keep moving about, how can I talk?

00:00:43.918 --> 00:00:46.421
You're too easily influenced by others.

00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:48.173
This is super slow jogging.

00:00:48.173 --> 00:00:50.050
Jogging while having a meeting.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.676
It's more efficient.

00:00:51.676 --> 00:00:53.553
Why don't you join me?

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:54.637
- What?
- Come on.

00:00:54.637 --> 00:00:55.680
Get up.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.848
Follow my steps.

00:00:56.848 --> 00:00:59.859
The principle is not to
get out of breath or tired.

00:01:02.312 --> 00:01:04.981
No, lighten your steps.

00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:05.982
Follow me.

00:01:05.982 --> 00:01:08.276
One, two, one, two, one.

00:01:08.276 --> 00:01:10.570
Okay, back to the meeting.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.282
Okay, we were just talking
about the new brand's spirit.

00:01:14.282 --> 00:01:17.167
I think we can use colors...

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:21.623
I think we can differentiate them by color

00:01:21.623 --> 00:01:23.083
or a new packaging.

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:25.668
Both can make customers feel that we...

00:01:25.668 --> 00:01:27.553
This is ridiculous.

00:01:30.548 --> 00:01:33.350
Hold on, I need to take this call.

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:40.683
- Hello?
- You're still at the office?

00:01:40.683 --> 00:01:41.768
Yes, I'm in a meeting.

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:42.894
It's so late.

00:01:42.894 --> 00:01:45.522
If you're tired, go to bed. I'm still busy.

00:01:45.522 --> 00:01:47.948
What's that thumping sound?

00:01:49.734 --> 00:01:52.195
It's probably footsteps coming from upstairs.

00:01:52.195 --> 00:01:53.738
Oh.

00:01:53.738 --> 00:01:55.281
Okay, that's all for now.
I need to get back to work.

00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:56.999
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.676
Why did you lie?

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:11.673
I just didn't want her to worry.

00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:15.074
Anyway, that's not important.
We're almost done, let's finish up.

00:02:54.572 --> 00:02:58.473
[Episode 11: Are my lies spoken out of love?]

00:03:08.938 --> 00:03:12.372
[Heat it up if you're hungry. Love you.]

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:35.840
You're back.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.182
Yes.

00:03:38.676 --> 00:03:42.062
Why didn't you shower, you dirty boy?

00:03:45.016 --> 00:03:47.110
I just want to hug you now.

00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:12.168
Come in.

00:04:12.168 --> 00:04:13.761
Chairwoman.

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:17.298
Is the situation more serious?

00:04:17.298 --> 00:04:18.508
What is it?

00:04:18.508 --> 00:04:20.927
I recently checked the shareholder registry.

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:22.804
I noticed that Lin Xi Ming and Qian Li Hua

00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:26.266
have been acquiring a lot
of Hongfa shares through brokers.

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:28.101
I'm worried that if this continues,

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:29.978
General Huang, Lin Xi Ming, and Qian Li Hua

00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:33.731
will soon control more than half of the shares.

00:04:33.731 --> 00:04:35.400
According to company law,

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.862
a shareholder who continuously
holds more than half of the shares

00:04:39.862 --> 00:04:42.414
for over three months can call an EGM.

00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:46.452
So, they want to call an EGM.

00:04:46.452 --> 00:04:49.755
They want to re-elect all directors
and replace the chair.

00:04:55.753 --> 00:04:58.715
But we can also acquire
Hongfa shares at a high price.

00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:01.342
But the available shares
in the market are limited.

00:05:01.342 --> 00:05:04.937
I'm worried we'll be too slow.

00:05:07.015 --> 00:05:09.517
Director Qian needs more than
half of the shares to pass.

00:05:09.517 --> 00:05:12.437
It requires the shares of
General Huang and Director Lin.

00:05:12.437 --> 00:05:15.064
We still have room.

00:05:15.064 --> 00:05:16.482
But at the last interim board meeting,

00:05:16.482 --> 00:05:18.985
I offered Director Lin a good deal,
but he refused.

00:05:18.985 --> 00:05:20.869
Why would he talk to me?

00:05:33.374 --> 00:05:36.294
Director Lin is actively buying Hongfa shares.

00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:39.547
His ultimate goal is to
merge Chaomai and Hongfa.

00:05:39.547 --> 00:05:43.343
Hongfa has limited shares
left in the market, but...

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:45.011
Chaomai is a listed company.

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:47.680
It shouldn't be too hard for us to buy shares.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.931
What do you mean?

00:05:48.931 --> 00:05:52.310
If you become a major shareholder
of both Hongfa and Chaomai,

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.229
it would be difficult for
Lin Xi Ming or anyone else

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:57.322
to merge the companies without consulting you.

00:05:59.692 --> 00:06:01.444
It's used to acquire assets or companies.

00:06:01.444 --> 00:06:03.571
The estate trust allows it.

00:06:03.571 --> 00:06:05.907
Currently, our price is 24.1.

00:06:05.907 --> 00:06:08.451
I recommend acquiring them at 27 dollars.

00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:11.120
A premium of 11.2 percent.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.791
Isn't an 11.2 percent premium
a little underwhelming?

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:16.876
If Lin Xi Ming supports
the stock price in the market,

00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:20.338
the market price could exceed 27 dollars.

00:06:20.338 --> 00:06:22.340
In that case, shareholders
won't be forced to sell

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.325
based on the public tender offer we proposed.

00:06:27.678 --> 00:06:29.914
Have you consulted the underwriting department?

00:06:29.914 --> 00:06:34.685
Their estimated price
is also around 27 dollars.

00:06:34.685 --> 00:06:38.439
But, I think if we're determined to win,

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:40.566
we can raise the price a little more.

00:06:40.566 --> 00:06:44.870
My suggestion is 28 dollars.

00:06:46.739 --> 00:06:48.624
28 dollars.

00:06:49.833 --> 00:06:51.854
[Xiao Ting Yun]

00:07:21.524 --> 00:07:25.744
Your call has been forwarded to voicemail.

00:07:47.175 --> 00:07:48.342
Hello, everyone.

00:07:48.342 --> 00:07:51.095
Effective immediately,
my company, Qianyi Investment,

00:07:51.095 --> 00:07:54.390
will launch a three-week
public tender offer for Chaomai.

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:56.642
The acquisition price is 28 dollars.

00:07:56.642 --> 00:07:59.353
The acquisition target is 20 percent.

00:07:59.353 --> 00:08:02.356
Friends who hold Chaomai shares,

00:08:02.356 --> 00:08:04.108
please contact us if you're interested.

00:08:04.108 --> 00:08:05.193
Thank you all.

00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:06.652
Today, Hongfa Chairman Zhou Xiao Qi

00:08:06.652 --> 00:08:09.572
announced a public tender offer for Chaomai.

00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:12.200
Due to the public tender offer
of a 20-percent premium,

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.949
Chaomai's stock price hit
its daily limit and locked up.

00:08:14.949 --> 00:08:17.991
Trading volume reached a new high by closing.

00:08:17.991 --> 00:08:20.011
As for why Zhou Xiao Qi launched

00:08:20.011 --> 00:08:21.567
a public tender offer for Chaomai shares,

00:08:21.567 --> 00:08:24.942
we interviewed two experts for analysis.

00:08:24.942 --> 00:08:29.003
Whether this acquisition is hostile
or friendly is currently unknown.

00:08:29.003 --> 00:08:30.341
The situation is unclear.

00:08:30.341 --> 00:08:32.741
But no matter what, if both sides

00:08:32.741 --> 00:08:35.120
can reach a consensus for a merger

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.698
or a strategic alliance,

00:08:37.698 --> 00:08:39.496
their future market share will be number one.

00:08:39.496 --> 00:08:41.882
And considering the overall benefits,

00:08:41.882 --> 00:08:43.367
it will definitely increase significantly.

00:08:43.367 --> 00:08:44.967
No matter what other media say,

00:08:44.967 --> 00:08:47.127
even if it's a consensual strategic alliance,

00:08:47.127 --> 00:08:48.918
I personally believe the biggest beneficiary

00:08:48.918 --> 00:08:51.648
will still be Hongfa Chairman Zhou Xiao Qi.

00:08:54.789 --> 00:08:57.745
Sis, hear me out.

00:08:57.745 --> 00:08:59.580
Zhou Xiao Qi needs to acquire at least

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.999
the minimum threshold of
5 percent of the shares.

00:09:01.999 --> 00:09:04.168
Only then can the public tender offer succeed.

00:09:04.168 --> 00:09:06.379
Chairman Lin will find a way.

00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:10.007
As long as the market price exceeds 28 dollars,

00:09:10.007 --> 00:09:13.010
shareholders will frantically
sell their shares.

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:15.846
They won't sell to Zhou Xiao Qi.

00:09:15.846 --> 00:09:17.932
It's not as simple as you think.

00:09:17.932 --> 00:09:19.559
The stock price has to exceed 28 dollars.

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:22.486
That's if Lin Xi Ming can come up
with the money to prop it up.

00:09:23.187 --> 00:09:27.608
The problem is, can he sustain it or not?

00:09:27.608 --> 00:09:29.860
Don't worry.

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:31.028
Don't you know what Chaomai is?

00:09:31.028 --> 00:09:32.822
It's Chairman Lin's fortune.

00:09:32.822 --> 00:09:35.207
He'll definitely fight for it.

00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:44.750
Listen, I've already booked my flight.

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:47.302
Can you reply when you get this?

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:57.513
Hello, Assistant VP.

00:09:57.513 --> 00:09:58.764
I'm Yao Zhi Xuan.

00:09:58.764 --> 00:10:01.108
Manager Han transferred me here.

00:10:02.643 --> 00:10:05.563
- Yao...
- Yao Zhi Xuan.

00:10:05.563 --> 00:10:07.697
Zhi Xuan.

00:10:08.816 --> 00:10:11.444
Good. Very good.

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:15.281
By the way, are you free tonight?

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:17.158
Yes.

00:10:17.158 --> 00:10:18.911
We have a meeting with a vendor tonight.

00:10:18.911 --> 00:10:20.578
Can you join us?

00:10:20.578 --> 00:10:22.170
Sure.

00:10:24.123 --> 00:10:25.757
Excellent.

00:10:30.421 --> 00:10:33.432
I just had a long meeting.

00:10:34.592 --> 00:10:36.935
I couldn't sleep last night.

00:10:37.928 --> 00:10:39.521
I'm so sleepy.

00:10:48.731 --> 00:10:51.233
Let's go for a checkup
the day after tomorrow, alright?

00:10:51.233 --> 00:10:52.659
Okay.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:00.409
Let's go somewhere in a couple of days, okay?

00:11:00.409 --> 00:11:02.286
It's so boring in Taipei.

00:11:02.286 --> 00:11:04.504
I want to get some sun.

00:11:06.374 --> 00:11:08.091
Let's go...

00:11:08.834 --> 00:11:10.635
Let's go to the beach.

00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:13.263
Okay.

00:11:16.008 --> 00:11:17.642
Let's take a break.

00:11:18.636 --> 00:11:20.034
Okay.

00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:35.243
Zhang Jian Bin.

00:11:36.237 --> 00:11:39.490
Do you want to hear what I found out for you?

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:41.117
Okay.

00:11:41.117 --> 00:11:43.619
That psychiatrist you were pursuing earlier...

00:11:43.619 --> 00:11:46.622
He owed tens of millions
of dollars to loan sharks.

00:11:46.622 --> 00:11:49.841
But recently, he's been
paying it back really fast.

00:11:52.169 --> 00:11:56.090
You mean after Zhan Qian Ren...

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:57.516
Yes.

00:11:58.384 --> 00:12:00.302
How do you know?

00:12:00.302 --> 00:12:01.345
Come on.

00:12:01.345 --> 00:12:03.806
Do you think I'm joking about
running the social beat?

00:12:03.806 --> 00:12:05.482
Tell me.

00:12:08.853 --> 00:12:11.939
That loan shark, Mr. Hua, who loaned him money

00:12:11.939 --> 00:12:13.573
spilled the beans.

00:12:14.942 --> 00:12:17.236
You know him too? Nice.

00:12:17.236 --> 00:12:20.573
Is there any way you can help me get in touch?

00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:22.658
I do know him quite well.

00:12:22.658 --> 00:12:24.535
But these people are very low-key.

00:12:24.535 --> 00:12:26.836
They don't like to contact people easily.

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.208
Why else would I need your help?

00:12:31.208 --> 00:12:33.919
An anonymous interview is fine, too.

00:12:33.919 --> 00:12:35.129
It's not that I can't do it.

00:12:35.129 --> 00:12:37.847
But it depends on what you give me in exchange.

00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:56.400
Miss Zhou Xiao Qi, this is
your health insurance card.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.235
You can pay at the counter later.

00:12:58.235 --> 00:12:59.828
Thank you.

What?

00:14:37.334 --> 00:14:40.713
Have you decided on the baby's name?

00:14:40.713 --> 00:14:42.764
Isn't it too early?

00:14:43.966 --> 00:14:45.092
Is it?

00:14:45.092 --> 00:14:47.428
The baby will be born in a few months.

00:14:47.428 --> 00:14:48.971
We'll have to...

00:14:48.971 --> 00:14:50.598
find a kindergarten,

00:14:50.598 --> 00:14:51.932
and a nanny.

00:14:51.932 --> 00:14:55.519
We'll have to think about
what else they should learn.

00:14:55.519 --> 00:14:57.987
We'll be really busy then.

00:14:58.772 --> 00:15:01.116
Let me think about it.

00:15:01.942 --> 00:15:03.535
Gu...

00:15:04.153 --> 00:15:05.745
Gu...

00:15:06.363 --> 00:15:08.206
Good morning.

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:15.039
Gu Mo Ning. Not bad.

00:15:15.039 --> 00:15:16.749
Is there a second option?

00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:18.584
A second option?

00:15:18.584 --> 00:15:21.219
Then it's "Good evening".

00:15:23.297 --> 00:15:25.424
I have an idea.

00:15:25.424 --> 00:15:27.892
Gu Qiao Si.

00:15:29.178 --> 00:15:30.679
Good choice.

00:15:30.679 --> 00:15:32.056
Good choice.

00:15:32.056 --> 00:15:35.184
♫ Maybe I'm crazy ♫

00:15:35.184 --> 00:15:38.187
♫ Too willful, you said too willful ♫

00:15:38.187 --> 00:15:43.575
♫ I don't plan to accept it ♫

00:15:57.706 --> 00:15:59.458
We interrupt this program for a news flash.

00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:02.963
Following Zhou Xiao Qi's announcement
of a public tender offer at $28,

00:16:02.963 --> 00:16:07.132
Chaomai's board stated it does not welcome
Zhou Xiao Qi's public tender offer

00:16:07.132 --> 00:16:09.740
and announced it will issue
20,000 treasury shares

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:11.136
to defend against the takeover.

00:16:11.136 --> 00:16:14.014
The stock price continues to rise to $28.9.

00:16:14.014 --> 00:16:15.648
Sources say...

00:16:22.398 --> 00:16:25.859
Ms. Zhou, what is your opinion
on Chaomai's treasury stock plan?

00:16:25.859 --> 00:16:28.195
I'm not at liberty to comment
on the Chaomai board's decision.

00:16:28.195 --> 00:16:30.614
Ms. Zhou, in response to
Chaomai's treasury stock plan,

00:16:30.614 --> 00:16:32.282
will you increase the price
of your public tender offer?

00:16:32.282 --> 00:16:33.283
Not at the moment.

00:16:33.283 --> 00:16:36.002
How confident are you that
the public tender offer will succeed?

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:39.331
Complete confidence.

00:16:39.331 --> 00:16:41.000
Where does this confidence come from?

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.126
What's your plan?

00:16:42.126 --> 00:16:45.094
- Thank you.
- Ms. Zhou, please explain.

00:16:59.226 --> 00:17:00.310
Chairwoman Zhou.

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:02.021
Hello, I'm Zhang Jian Bin,
a reporter from Shi Weekly.

00:17:02.021 --> 00:17:03.822
Do you remember me?

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.066
Hello.

00:17:06.066 --> 00:17:08.736
Excuse me, I have some photos here.

00:17:08.736 --> 00:17:10.745
I'd like you to explain them.

00:17:14.199 --> 00:17:17.536
Dr. Gu previously owed a large sum
to an underground loan shark.

00:17:17.536 --> 00:17:19.913
I heard he paid it back
remarkably fast recently.

00:17:19.913 --> 00:17:23.959
I wonder if it has anything to do with you.

00:17:23.959 --> 00:17:25.491
I'm sorry.

00:17:25.491 --> 00:17:28.084
I'm not obligated to answer that question.

00:17:55.449 --> 00:17:57.500
Hello, President Qiu.

00:17:59.369 --> 00:18:01.413
Yes, it's been a while.

00:18:01.413 --> 00:18:03.999
A reporter from your magazine

00:18:03.999 --> 00:18:05.751
just came to me with two photos.

00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:07.669
There might be a misunderstanding
about those photos.

00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:09.971
I was hoping you could help me out.

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:14.718
Okay, sure.

00:18:14.718 --> 00:18:17.513
This could cause reputation problems
for my company.

00:18:17.513 --> 00:18:19.856
I'm counting on you.

00:18:20.766 --> 00:18:22.692
Okay, thank you.

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:27.064
Then let's schedule our next meeting.

00:18:27.064 --> 00:18:28.857
- Thank you all for your hard work today.
- Thank you.

00:18:28.857 --> 00:18:30.700
Okay, thank you, Vice President.

00:18:33.403 --> 00:18:36.198
By the way, please send me
the information you just mentioned.

00:18:36.198 --> 00:18:37.783
- Okay, no problem.
- Okay, I'll trouble you again.

00:18:37.783 --> 00:18:39.208
Thank you.

00:18:46.166 --> 00:18:48.259
What do you think of the discussion just now?

00:18:48.919 --> 00:18:50.295
I don't know.

00:18:50.295 --> 00:18:52.631
I got so hungry halfway through the meeting.

00:18:52.631 --> 00:18:54.933
I couldn't concentrate at all.

00:18:56.844 --> 00:18:58.095
What do you want to eat?

00:18:58.095 --> 00:18:59.479
It's my treat.

00:19:01.723 --> 00:19:04.768
How about Elpida?

00:19:04.768 --> 00:19:06.311
You know that restaurant too?

00:19:06.311 --> 00:19:08.438
It moved to Taichung.

00:19:08.438 --> 00:19:10.198
Is Taichung far?

00:19:12.276 --> 00:19:13.868
I'll drive you.

00:19:15.988 --> 00:19:17.664
Let's go.

00:19:45.809 --> 00:19:47.402
Xiao Ting Yun.

00:19:48.645 --> 00:19:50.530
Xiao Ting Yun, are you there?

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:22.514
[You have other options. Don't be afraid.]

00:20:28.477 --> 00:20:30.771
How many times do you
need to go to the bathroom?

00:20:30.771 --> 00:20:33.614
What is it? I'll open it when we get back.

00:20:34.274 --> 00:20:36.659
Then I can drink it later?

00:20:38.445 --> 00:20:40.489
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:20:40.489 --> 00:20:41.573
Just a moment.

00:20:41.573 --> 00:20:42.790
Okay.

00:20:44.243 --> 00:20:47.246
The style this time
is very different from before.

00:20:47.246 --> 00:20:49.039
Welcome, both of you.

00:20:49.039 --> 00:20:51.541
This is an aperitif prepared for you.

00:20:51.541 --> 00:20:52.960
Posseco sparkling wine.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.211
Here you go.

00:20:54.211 --> 00:20:56.380
For the appetizer,
we have North Coast calamari.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.465
It's presented salt-grilled.

00:20:58.465 --> 00:21:01.093
For the main course, we have Australian steak.

00:21:01.093 --> 00:21:02.970
- We also have salt-baked pork chop.
- Right.

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:06.014
Both have excellent texture. You may choose.

00:21:06.014 --> 00:21:08.225
- Okay.
- Enjoy your meal.

00:21:08.225 --> 00:21:11.027
The menu seems quite different from before.

00:21:37.504 --> 00:21:39.464
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:21:39.464 --> 00:21:41.474
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:21:44.678 --> 00:21:45.846
Let's try it.

00:21:45.846 --> 00:21:48.272
Do you want to try the pork?

00:21:49.141 --> 00:21:50.559
- What?
- Hurry up.

00:21:50.559 --> 00:21:52.777
I... You...

00:21:53.812 --> 00:21:55.147
How is it? Is it good?

00:21:55.147 --> 00:21:57.365
Not bad. Do you want to try the beef?

00:22:07.242 --> 00:22:08.535
Check the information for me.

00:22:08.535 --> 00:22:11.671
If there's no problem, please sign here.

00:22:18.712 --> 00:22:21.222
We'll contact you if there's any news.

00:22:31.433 --> 00:22:33.025
Pan Xin Tong.

00:22:34.061 --> 00:22:35.479
Are you all right?

00:22:35.479 --> 00:22:36.813
Xiao Qi.

00:22:36.813 --> 00:22:38.656
Why is it so serious?

00:22:39.524 --> 00:22:41.492
It's all right.

00:22:53.041 --> 00:22:55.419
Let me ask you something.

00:22:55.419 --> 00:22:56.503
Everyone is paying attention

00:22:56.503 --> 00:22:59.339
to the showdown between
Hongfa and Chaomai's chairmen.

00:22:59.339 --> 00:23:03.427
Why are you going to Hongfa
and Zhou Xiao Qi to talk nonsense?

00:23:03.427 --> 00:23:05.095
Do you think I have too much free time?

00:23:05.095 --> 00:23:06.722
Do you want me to get sued?

00:23:06.722 --> 00:23:08.181
No, Chief Editor.

00:23:08.181 --> 00:23:11.810
But on the day Zhan Qian Ren died,

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:15.689
Gu Hou Ze's car was parked
in front of her house.

00:23:15.689 --> 00:23:17.107
After Zhan Qian Ren died,

00:23:17.107 --> 00:23:18.900
Gu Hou Ze repaid his debt so quickly.

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:20.360
Isn't it obvious?

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:21.903
They both killed him for money!

00:23:21.903 --> 00:23:22.946
Very good.

00:23:22.946 --> 00:23:25.657
Great deduction, Conan Zhang.

00:23:25.657 --> 00:23:26.867
Where's the evidence?

00:23:26.867 --> 00:23:29.377
Where's the irrefutable evidence?

00:23:30.162 --> 00:23:33.165
Do you know how much pressure I'm under?

00:23:33.165 --> 00:23:34.666
Come on.

00:23:34.666 --> 00:23:36.043
Do the math yourself.

00:23:36.043 --> 00:23:37.919
How many employees do I have to lay off

00:23:37.919 --> 00:23:40.805
to make up for these lost advertising fees?

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:43.550
Go home.

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:45.810
Go home and think about it.

00:23:55.395 --> 00:23:57.363
How did you get hurt?

00:23:59.691 --> 00:24:01.325
Where did you...

00:24:05.489 --> 00:24:07.206
Are you all right?

00:24:08.533 --> 00:24:10.126
I'm fine.

00:24:11.411 --> 00:24:13.421
What happened?

00:24:16.333 --> 00:24:19.378
Someone passed by me on a motorbike.

00:24:19.378 --> 00:24:21.963
The person riding with them
slashed me with a knife.

00:24:21.963 --> 00:24:23.973
He slashed you?

00:24:25.592 --> 00:24:27.260
Did you call the police?

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:29.187
Did they catch that person?

00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:32.315
Xiao Qi took care of everything.

00:24:48.073 --> 00:24:49.665
I'm sorry.

00:24:50.575 --> 00:24:53.920
I was too busy at work today
and didn't get your call.

00:24:56.748 --> 00:24:59.717

What is the truth?

00:39:39.547 --> 00:39:42.849
It's fine as long as we both know it, okay?

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:45.560
Okay.

00:39:46.929 --> 00:39:48.688
I'm sorry for putting you through this.

00:39:49.515 --> 00:39:51.149
You, too.

00:39:52.143 --> 00:39:53.735
Get some rest.

00:39:54.523 --> 00:39:56.115
Good night.

00:40:41.772 --> 00:40:43.490
I'm home.

00:40:44.233 --> 00:40:46.485
You're home so early today.

00:40:46.485 --> 00:40:48.404
I only bought one fried rice.

00:40:48.404 --> 00:40:50.372
It's okay. I'm not hungry.

00:40:52.616 --> 00:40:54.459
I'll get you some cutlery.

00:41:29.528 --> 00:41:31.579
What's your relationship with that woman?

00:41:33.616 --> 00:41:36.368
That's all nonsense. Can you trust me?

00:41:36.368 --> 00:41:38.537
The date on there is the day I got injured.

00:41:38.537 --> 00:41:39.896
I kept calling you, but you didn't pick up.

00:41:39.896 --> 00:41:42.299
So, you were having dinner with another girl.

00:41:45.044 --> 00:41:47.588
Chao Mai has a business
partnership with Snobis.

00:41:47.588 --> 00:41:49.757
Lin Feng Hua was just negotiating with me
on behalf of the company.

00:41:49.757 --> 00:41:51.759
We just had dinner after the meeting.

00:41:51.759 --> 00:41:55.721
You went to Taichung
for a Michelin-starred meal?

00:41:55.721 --> 00:41:58.732
It just so happens that we used to
frequent that restaurant.

00:42:02.147 --> 00:42:05.397
I mean... Anyway, we're just working together.

00:42:05.397 --> 00:42:07.449
- You can trust me.
- Stop talking.

00:43:07.459 --> 00:43:10.887
Hey, don't puke on the floor.

00:43:13.757 --> 00:43:15.600
Don't drink too much.

00:43:34.823 --> 00:43:37.698
- Let's go to the North Coast next Wednesday.
- Okay.

00:43:37.698 --> 00:43:39.450
Hang on, I'm going to buy something. Help me.

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:40.834
- Okay.
- Thank you.

00:43:42.036 --> 00:43:44.003
Welcome.

00:43:55.549 --> 00:43:57.926
- What?
- Pick one.

00:43:57.926 --> 00:43:59.803
I'll give you both.

00:43:59.803 --> 00:44:01.096
You can have one.

00:44:01.096 --> 00:44:04.441
- Okay, this one.
- No, you want the blue one.

00:44:06.143 --> 00:44:08.236
Okay.

00:44:24.036 --> 00:44:26.622
Have you had dinner?

00:44:26.622 --> 00:44:28.256
Yes.

00:44:40.636 --> 00:44:43.229
You still don't trust me?

00:44:46.392 --> 00:44:49.402
I can't answer that question now.

00:44:51.522 --> 00:44:53.698
But can you promise me this?

00:44:55.067 --> 00:44:57.785
If you fall in love with someone else,

00:44:59.196 --> 00:45:01.247
can you tell me?

00:45:13.043 --> 00:45:14.802
I'm going to take a shower.
