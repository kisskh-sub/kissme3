00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.640
มายด์เอาผลงานของคุณออกแบบไปใช้ในการประกวด

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.400
And that architect gossip page that leaked the news…

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.440
was actually Khun Thee’s doing.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.280
I truly didn't expect…

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.400
Mind Space is no longer yours.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.440
Thank you for trusting Jinta Architect.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.920
And what are you drawing now?

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.600
designing our future home…

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.640
the home we’ll live in together in the future.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.400
The land itself has no problem.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.640
You two must get married first.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:52.840
Get married!?

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.320
The auspicious up time is only until the end of this year. If you go past that—

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.640
—you’ll definitely break up.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.280
What— can a Feng Shui Master even say stuff like that!?

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.440
- Rin!
- Hey, hey!

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.480
- Ouch, that hurts!
- Stop!

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.000
Um, Master… do you mean that—

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.400
If we don’t get married, then… we—

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.920
—won’t be able to build this house at all?

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.040
Love needs a firm pillar.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.360
Only then can you start laying the foundation.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.000
Luv ya, loving you

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.520
Baby put your heart with mine.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.960
Baby baby boo

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.440
Waiting here — don’t know when you’ll realize

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.880
That I’m the one you keep inside your mind.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.720
If you feel the same, just say it, don’t hide.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.680
I’m crazy about you. [MUSIC]

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.760
Will that be enough? I can buy you another one.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.680
Judging from the shape, I don’t think it’s enough.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.600
Aokbab, what’s wrong?

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.920
It’s your Feng Shui Master. He stressed me out.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.440
Sigh…

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.040
Huh? What happened?

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.040
I told you, didn’t I? You shouldn’t have called that Feng Shui Master.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.280
Look, he stressed her out this much.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.080
Aokbab, don’t worry about it.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.800
Listen to me.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.160
If people truly love each other—

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.920
—something this small—

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.520
—won’t make you two break up.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.200
But still— better safe than sorry, right?

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.400
If you don’t believe, don’t disrespect it.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.480
But what Chan said is true.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.000
You and Rin love each other like crazy.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.760
You can get married when you’re ready.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.120
…I guess.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.800
“You guess”? Seriously?

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.320
Well…

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.080
One of my friends once got the same warning from a Feng Shui Master.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.520
But he didn’t believe it.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.760
And they actually broke up before getting married.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.280
Wow… you’re amazing. Such a “great” big brother.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.880
How do you comfort someone and end up stressing them out even more, huh?

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.760
Aokbab, don’t listen to him.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.320
Oh!

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:04.480
My god!!

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.400
Hang in there.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.800
Am I in the wrong?

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.080
You’re the worst one here.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.760
This is how you “comfort” her? Look at her!

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.200
You better go buy her another one.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.400
What era are we even living in?

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.320
Suddenly he say we can’t build a house—

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.320
We have to get married first, and if not this year, we’ll definitely break up.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.560
If P’ Aokbab hadn’t been standing there—

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.240
I would’ve gone in and decked that Feng Shui Master. Just a little more and I’d swing.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.120
With that energy, you should go on “Hone Krasae” (the talk show).

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.720
Things like this—if you don’t believe, don’t disrespect.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.400
I think believing it doesn’t hurt anyone.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.080
This Feng Shui Master is really accurate, Rin.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.280
P’Prim…

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.600
What’s the actual logic behind fortune-telling anyway?

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.040
Well, even if it’s not scientific—

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.800
Doesn’t mean it’s not real, right?

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.360
But love is about two people.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.240
Did a Feng Shui Master ever help me and P’Aokbab fall in love?

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.040
No. And you know I hate being told what to do.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.280
Okay, how about this—

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.680
If a Feng Shui Master told you and Khun Jade to get married right now—

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.640
Would you do it?

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.000
What’s with this atmosphere?

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.200
What are you saying? Don’t embarrass me in front of Khun Jade!

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.640
Why did you hit me?!

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.280
– I’m gonna wipe the glasses. / – Why so suddenly spicy?

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.960
Kids these days… such naughty mouths. Hand—

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.000
Give me your hand! High five. Now. High five!

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.760
There. Does it hurt? Maybe you’ll remember it next time.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.520
Hey—what are you looking at?

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.440
Wow, flustered!

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:18.920
I’m here, Sis.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.400
Sorry I’m late.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.160
Traffic was crazy, and P'Prim and I were gossiping a bit and—

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.760
Got carried away.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:29.840
Are you hungry?

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.760
Happy Valentine’s Day.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.160
Valentine’s?

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.960
It’s not Valentine’s Day today.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.520
Every day is Valentine’s Day for us.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.440
Thank you.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.360
This is so cute… thank you.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.360
Ooh I’m hungry now. Let’s order food.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.320
Can I have the menu, please?

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.200
You haven’t ordered anything yet, right?

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.800
Yeah, I’m waiting so we can order together.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.800
I’m starving.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.280
I’ll have this one.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.720
Remember this.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.040
The problem isn’t you.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.480
It’s the one who doesn’t want to get married.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:36.720
Rin…

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.320
About what the Feng Shui master said today… what do you think?

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.720
Uh… I don’t believe it.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.080
And…?

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.400
What about what he said about marriage?

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:49.720
Marriage?

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.200
I just feel…

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.280
Us being together like this…

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.640
Loving each other like this…

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.320
It already makes me really happy.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.120
It’s enough.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.800
Don’t joke around.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.520
I’m being serious.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.800
I am serious.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.280
Think about it, sis.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.680
We love each other this much…

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.200
And he comes telling us we’ll break up?

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.880
That doesn’t make any sense.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.400
He’s just saying random stuff.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:16.920
Right?

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:22.960
Mm-hmm.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.400
That's true…

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.120
I think…

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.840
We should focus our time on work right now.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.200
Since the company is just start expanding.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.160
Or…

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.480
Do you actually believe what the Feng Shui master said?

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:39.480
Oh—

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.280
I don’t believe it, it’s just…

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.720
P’Pad keeps saying things—

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.760
He keeps getting in my head and I…

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.000
End up worrying about pointless things.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.320
Let’s just order something delicious instead.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.400
What do you want to eat? Want to share?

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:01.840
I’ll get the beef.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.320
And what soup do you want?

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.600
I’ll take the mushroom soup.

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.200
Mushroom soup, okay.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.080
Hey, let’s go try this Japanese restaurant together sometime.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.200
Looks good. Sure, let’s go.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.160
Don’t forget, we have our vaccine appointment next week.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:31.640
Yeah.

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.240
Hello?

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:39.880
Hey! Where are you right now?

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.320
I’m at home. What’s up?

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.440
You’re home—who are you with?

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.440
My girlfriend.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.520
Hmmm??

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.200
If you really have a girlfriend—

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.360
Bring her and introduce her properly!

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.360
Get to the point. Where are you guys anyway?

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.800
What? Did you forget?

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.800
Tonight is Ped’s bachelorette party!

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.320
Shit—oh my god.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.840
I totally forgot. I’ll call you back.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.080
What happened?

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.680
Um… my friend’s bachelorette party is tonight.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:08.760
I gotta go.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:09.760
Oh…

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.560
Um…Uh... okay, then.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.760
Text me when you get there.

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.160
Hey!

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.200
Why are you so late?

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:28.960
Hey!

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.160
What happened?

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.840
It’s pouring like crazy!

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.480
Ped’s whole party is ruined.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.880
I had to move everything inside.

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.160
And where’s Ped?

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.880
Her fiancé called. No idea where she went to answer it.

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.000
Go check on Lisa first.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.720
Her boyfriend literally just dumped her.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.040
What? Why? Weren’t they about to get engaged?

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.800
Exactly. Go—go check on her.

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.080
Lisa…

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.880
Aokbab!!

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.200
I should’ve listened to the fortune teller from the start.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.160
She said I should hurry up and marry P'Tong.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.000
We’ve been fighting more and more.

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:04.000
And in the end… he broke up with me.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:11.680
Wait, hold on—

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.520
Which fortune teller?

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:20.720
He’s insanely accurate…

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.360
Especially about love—he’s a solid ten out of ten.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.600
This person?!

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.520
Guys…

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.720
P'Boss…

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.320
He cancelled the wedding.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:34.920
- Huh?!
- Huh?!

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:36.760
The party’s ruined…

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:37.920
And I don’t even have a husband anymore…

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.440
I wanna die.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.400
- Uh!!…
- Hey!!…

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.640
Calm down, calm down…

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.400
I should’ve listened to what the Feng Shui master said…

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.160
He told me to marry on the auspicious date.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.400
But we delayed it and past the date…

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.120
So everything’s gone wrong!

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:03.840
Wait—

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:07.040
Don’t tell me… it’s the same fortune teller as Lisa?

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:07.920
Yup.

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:11.240
Lisa recommended him to Ped.

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.560
Oh shit—

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.600
The world is way too damn small!!

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:17.200
Rin.

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:20.680
Come sleep on the bed.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:24.480
Ah… sis?

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.080
Can I finish this first? Just a bit more, almost done.

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.000
Can’t you finish it tomorrow?

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.520
I need to wrap it up.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.960
Otherwise I can’t move on to the next thing.

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:40.600
Let me finish this first.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.080
I’ll follow you up in a bit.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.320
When did I fall asleep…

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.280
Oh.

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.160
Come here.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.400
If the Feng Shui master warned you like that…

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.680
Then you need to marry N'Rin as soon as possible.

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:21.200
Khun Aokbab…

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.600
This calls for spiritual boosting (Moo).

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.480
These are love–luck spiritual venue options.

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.160
Do you want me to scout wedding venues for you?

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.440
Do you prefer…

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:34.800
A hotel vibe or a restaurant vibe?

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.880
I’ll find you a good wedding organizer.

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.280
I know several good ones.

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:42.520
And if you want to propose to Rin—

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.480
Don’t worry. You can count on us.

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.520
And for the surprise part—

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.160
You really don’t have to worry.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.840
We’re absolute experts at that.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:50.960
Very much!

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:55.200
Rin's coming!

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.560
Huh? What are you doing, sis?

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.000
Rin.

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:14.360
Rin.

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:15.720
Are you okay?

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:18.560
What is it, sis?

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.640
How was the talking to the client? Tired?

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.880
The client wants us to revise the design again… and it has to be done within this month.

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.560
My head hurts… I don’t even know if I can finish it in time.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.240
Well then—

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:34.360
How about we get some good Japanese food tonight?

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.200
Okay… but let me finish this part first.

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.280
Hey— you can take a break, you know.

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.120
- I can’t, the client wants it...
- Hey—

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:43.480
This is an order.

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.080
Take a break and get ready for dinner.

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:52.480
…Okay.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:58.760
I’ll close this for now.

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:09.440
Rin.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.320
If there’s any task you can’t handle, just tell me. I’ll get someone to help.

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.240
It’s okay. I can handle it.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.400
I’ll fight till the end.

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:20.480
And what if your body can’t take it?

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.240
If my body can’t take it, then you’ll take care of me.

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.800
But you have to take care of me until I grow old, okay?

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:29.800
…Alright.

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:38.480
Rin.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.480
How do you see the future?

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.560
Hmm…

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:47.800
The future?

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.240
Well…

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.320
Keep working like this.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.640
Save up a lot of money, and then—

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.400
Take you traveling.

00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:58.920
Anywhere you want to go.

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:02.400
And you?

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:09.800
I want to get married.

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.520
Why are you so quiet?

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:52.920
Mm.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:54.640
To be honest…

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:57.720
I don’t really like ceremonies.

00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:59.840
It feels wasteful to me.

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.920
I’d rather use the money to fix up the house.

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.720
That’s more important.

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.360
Why do you think that?

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.200
That’s just how I feel.

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:12.840
How do you want me to think, then?

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:30.920
I understand your reasons, Rin.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:34.200
But I want you to understand mine too.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:49.840
Rin… you're still young.

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:25.320
I’m not really hungry.

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:43.520
“Still young,” huh…

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:22.400
I’m gonna stay over at P’Prim’s tonight.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:28.320
…Okay.

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:30.760
I’m going to P’Pad’s place tonight too.

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.160
I’ll probably stay over.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:38.360
Mm.

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:11.960
Love life is just like this.

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:13.880
Some days you get each other—

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.360
—and some days nothing goes the way you want.

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:17.920
Just work through it slowly.

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:20.000
And about the feng shui master—

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:21.200
don’t overthink it.

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:22.440
I don’t think it really matters.

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:24.720
I agree with that.

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.400
When you two have problems, talk them out slowly.

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.000
Try to understand each other.

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.520
Cause if you keep taking jabs at each other like this—

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:32.960
—it won’t do any good.

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:37.040
At first I was worried about what the master said…

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.640
but now… that’s not the problem anymore.

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:43.360
I just feel like our thoughts… don’t really align.

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:45.440
And if—

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:47.000
we hit an even bigger issue someday…

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.640
will it become something worse?

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:51.520
Hold on, hold on— you're overthinking way too much.

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:52.320
Yeah.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.360
People don’t think the same way.

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:57.120
You two just started dating.

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.520
Master Rin only graduated a few years ago.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:02.640
So isn’t it normal—

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.600
—that she’s not thinking about marriage yet?

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:05.800
True.

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.080
And if you look at it another way—

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:11.040
What if one day I do want to get married…

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:12.560
…and Rin refuses to marry me?

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:14.320
Whoa, whoa— sis, hold up.

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:15.520
Calm down.

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:16.760
Wait a sec—

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:17.840
Right now—

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:19.720
You two are looking at things from totally different angles.

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:22.040
How about this instead—

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:23.320
All of us…

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:24.920
help you find a solution together?

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.080
Your turn, P'Pad.

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:28.400
Help your sister think.

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:30.160
How did this suddenly get dumped on me?

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.080
Isn't it because of you?

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.200
Come on, help her out.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.920
- How about this?
- Hmm.

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:44.840
Let’s go back to that same Feng Shui master again.

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.480
Maybe he has a fix for this.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.000
Are you crazy?

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:52.280
She’s already stressed enough with new problems— you want her stressed about the old ones too?

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.760
Actually… that might not be a bad idea.

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.760
I kinda want to hear what he’ll say.

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:59.120
If he has a way to solve things between me and Rin—

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:00.600
I’ll do anything.

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:03.960
- See?
- Oh my god…

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:05.720
Oh...I can’t believe this.

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.320
Unbelievable.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:09.400
That Feng Shui guy is powerful as hell.

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.480
- Oh god…
- Better than doing nothing, right?

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:21.040
I just want to focus on my work.

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:24.520
But she told me my thinking was childish.

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:29.600
I should be angry, honestly.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.680
Because all she does is fuss about getting married.

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.120
Rin…

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.080
Do you know…

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:50.800
what's the meaning of marriage truly is?

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.720
Just showing off that two people love each other.

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:01.200
Showing off a pretty dress on social media… I guess.

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:09.640
It’s not like that.

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:12.400
Marriage…

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:15.440
is a promise two people make to each other.

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:20.240
That they’ll love and take care of one another—

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.000
in good times and bad.

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:25.120
And stay by each other’s side.

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:30.840
Isn’t just being together enough?

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:39.000
And do you know—

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:40.640
why people even hold wedding ceremonies?

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:43.840
No idea.

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.560
Because having a wedding…

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.680
is a way to honor both families.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.720
No one sees it as showing off, Rin.

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:06.080
Think about it carefully.

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:09.400
If our parents were still here…

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:15.840
Imagine how happy they’d be to see you get married.

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:24.280
They’d want wedding photos of you—

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:29.280
hung up at home.

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:32.800
To look at whenever they miss you.

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:16.720
I really am immature, huh…

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:18.840
Hey, come on now…

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:47.120
It absolutely has to be within this year.

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:49.680
The sooner the wedding, the better.

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:54.480
If it’s around mid-year…

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:55.760
that would be even more auspicious.

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:58.240
Uh… Master…

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:00.560
The wedding itself isn’t the problem.

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:03.440
It’s just… my girlfriend…

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:06.960
She doesn’t seem to want to get married. What should I do?

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:19.040
Fate has already been written.

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:22.800
Huh?

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:24.800
Where did you two first meet...

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:26.640
Then start from there.

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:29.160
Yes?

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:25.880
I’m back.

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:31.880
Would you like go to Kitakyushu together?

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.280
Kitakyushu?

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:42.440
Last time we went because of work.

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:44.440
But this time…

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.320
I want to go as your girlfriend.

00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:00.440
Why so quiet? You don’t want to go?

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.120
No, it’s not that.

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:11.040
I just need to ask my boss for the leave first.

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:21.640
How many days do you want?

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:17.800
Thank you.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.320
- Thank you
- Sure.

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:23.240
I’m heading out.

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:24.880
Are you sure about this?

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:27.560
Okay then—

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:28.920
I’ll wait in the car.

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:30.160
Bye.

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:31.440
Bye-bye.

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:37.920
Of course, I'm sure about this.

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:41.320
Right now, whatever it takes to win Rin’s heart—

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:42.680
I’ll do it.

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:47.560
Wait.

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:49.800
Why does this dialogue sound familiar…?

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:53.040
I feel like I’ve said it before.

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:54.600
If that’s the case—

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:57.600
Go propose to Rin and make it happen.

00:30:58.840 --> 00:30:59.520
Yeah.

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:01.280
Go.

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:07.240
Bye-bye.

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:11.720
They’ve left.

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:11.040
What are you wishing for? You’re taking so long this time.

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:15.440
I wished for this trip to be smooth, with clear skies.

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:18.240
I thought you were wishing to win the lottery.

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:20.000
What?

00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:21.360
Ouch.

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:22.520
That hurts.

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:25.920
Let’s go, I’m hungry.

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:27.720
Yeah, just a sec. You go on first.

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:42.680
Please let everything go smoothly.

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:47.920
Hurry, I’m hungry!

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:49.200
Okay, I’m coming.

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:17.800
You know, I understand now.

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:20.120
Why you want to get married.

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:27.280
Even though I don’t understand everything—

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:29.120
But—

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:31.760
When I imagine the two of us getting married—

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:34.720
It would probably be really, really cute, right?

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:50.560
Whatever makes you happy—

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:53.200
I want to do it for you.

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:00.920
Shall we go to the museum?

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:04.040
Let’s go back to the first place—

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:06.720
The place where it all began for us.

00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:09.920
Mm-hmm.

00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:11.640
I want to go.

00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:14.560
But right now—

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:16.960
Let’s eat first. I’m hungry.

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:22.120
Cheers first.

00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:30.440
Mmm, this is really good.

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:03.120
Your foot hurts?

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:06.720
- Want me to carry you on my back?
- No, no, no—no need!

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:08.280
Just a bit more, we’re almost there.

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:16.920
Slowly, okay?

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:22.680
Let’s swap shoes.

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.040
No, it’s fine.

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:25.760
They’ll end up hurting your feet instead.

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:27.920
But at least—

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:30.360
I’d be helping lessen your pain.

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:32.000
Come on, let’s switch.

00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:07.120
Thank you, Rin.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.440
I’m adorable, right?

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:19.480
Let’s go.

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:23.080
Better?

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:26.440
You okay now?

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:28.320
You alright?

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:29.960
- Okay, let’s go.

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:35.280
It’s cold…

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:52.720
Wow…

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:54.160
The view is really beautiful, right?

00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:56.640
The view in front of me is beautiful too…

00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:58.320
…and cute.

00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:03.920
Oh wow, someone’s getting bold lately.

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:10.320
Rin…

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:44.280
Umm…

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:46.120
Marry me.

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:54.120
It’s just that—

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:55.880
You don’t want to?

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:00.480
There’s no ring, sis…

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:10.280
Where did it go…?

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:17.640
Where is it…?

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:20.800
Or— or maybe like— maybe it…

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:22.160
Might’ve fallen over there!

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:24.920
Let’s look for it— come on!

00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:27.360
Careful, sis— slow down!

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:34.120
Do you see it?

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:41.440
No… it’s not here.

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:46.760
It’s really not here…

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:48.880
Or maybe it’s at the restaurant?

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:53.280
Then let’s go, come on!

00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.320
Sis, be careful!

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:04.920
Oh—

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:09.560
- Oh!
- Ow!

00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:13.600
- Sis, did you find it? Do you see it?
- No, nothing…

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:14.920
Look carefully first.

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:17.680
Let me shine my light for a sec—here, here.

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:19.400
Check slowly… do you see anything?

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.320
I don’t see it… not at all.

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:23.600
Ugh…

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:26.080
Slow down, slow down — calm down, breathe.

00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:32.240
- Then… sis—
- Hm?

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:35.480
Should we try looking outside?

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:04.040
It’s okay, Sis…

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.080
I’m sorry…

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:12.240
For losing the ring…

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:18.680
I wanted this trip to be perfect, to be memorable…

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:20.720
But I messed it up instead…

00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:24.600
Don’t blame yourself.

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:28.000
I know you’re sad, sis.

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:37.000
But… thank you so much.

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:42.520
Wait… you knew?

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:51.280
I’ve known the whole time.

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:54.200
That you were trying so hard to get a ring for me.

00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:58.000
Just that… already makes me so happy.

00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:23.320
We also have this design as well, ma’am.

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:24.320
Yes.

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:27.000
Do you have any specific style in mind?

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:30.440
I’d like a platinum ring.

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:32.400
Something simple.

00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:35.120
Elegant, but with small details.

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:36.040
I see.

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:38.400
Maybe try this one.

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:40.240
It’s clean and simple.

00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:42.920
And it has the small details you’re looking for.

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:45.840
It’s quite lovely, isn’t it?

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:04.280
If you knew… why didn’t you say anything?

00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:08.960
Because I saw how much effort you put into surprising me.

00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:12.720
So I didn’t want to ruin it.

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:17.680
But now everything’s ruined…

00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:20.760
I’m sorry… for losing the ring.

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:25.640
I guess I can’t propose to you anymore.

00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:36.360
It doesn’t matter if there’s no ring.

00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:39.840
Of course it matters. How can we get engaged without it?

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:49.400
I fell in love with you…

00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:51.000
Because of a drawing.

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:02.240
So… can I propose to you with a drawing?

00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:57.960
Will you marry me?

00:44:58.800 --> 00:44:59.640
My love.

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:05.000
Huh? Why aren’t you taking a shower?

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:08.960
I have something for you.

00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:41.040
I know that…

00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:44.160
you wanted to propose here.

00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:49.920
So I secretly bought a ring.

00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:53.920
Let me put it on you.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.480
Thank you, Rin…

00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:41.720
for coming into my life.

00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:45.960
and showing me how beautiful love can be.

00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:52.400
Thank you for bringing happiness into my everyday life.

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:55.040
Ever since the first day we met.

00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:01.760
I promise…

00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:05.680
that I will cherish and protect our love with everything I have.

00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:15.240
Do you know…?

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:17.920
Before I met you…

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.040
I had no idea what love really was.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.640
I didn’t even know what it was supposed to look like.

00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:32.480
You’re the only one…

00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:34.400
who makes my heart race.

00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:43.240
You were also my first kiss.

00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:53.440
Thank you…

00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:55.200
for coming into my life.

00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:58.600
For completing my life.

00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:02.240
Thank you…

00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:05.200
for designing this love with me.

00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:08.200
I’m the luckiest girl in the world, you know that?

00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:17.320
I love you.

00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:22.240
I love you too, Rin.

00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:24.000
Alright, I’m taking the photo now. Are you ready?

00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:27.160
Okay—cheese!

00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:15.920
P'Mind, please.

00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:32.280
Hello.

00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:33.960
I’m Mind from MindScape.

00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:39.160
It’s undeniable that technology is becoming increasingly integral to our daily lives.

00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:41.840
Technology has already become a part of who we are.

00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:44.280
And it’s likely that our world and our way of life—

00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:45.680
—are about to change even more.

00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:48.680
Which brings us to today’s concept—

00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:51.720
A hotel that brings together the technologies of the future.

00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:54.520
While still providing maximum comfort to all guests.

00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:57.320
In an era where everyone values privacy—

00:58:57.320 --> 00:58:59.360
We aim to minimize staff presence.

00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:02.560
Yet still respond to every customer’s need 24/7.

00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:56.320
It feels like a dream, doesn’t it?

01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:11.120
I’m so happy.

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:14.240
That I finally have a home—

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:16.600
A home where I get to live with you for the rest of my life.

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:22.440
I’m just as happy.

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:36.560
I fell for you because of your drawings.

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:39.160
And when we proposed—

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.480
We still used a drawing.

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:49.120
So on our first day in this home—

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:54.880
Can I keep this memory as a drawing too?

01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:10.160
Of course you can.

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:31.480
Do you love Aokbab?

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.280
I love you more than anyone in the world.

01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:39.680
You silly girl.

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:44.080
If I fall into the water, will you save me?

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:47.080
- Of course! I’ll grab you right away. / - Grab me how?

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:51.920
Last time I came here wishing for love.

01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:54.800
Please help me find my love again this time.

01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:02.120
So you’re waiting for destiny to deliver true love to you or what, Tis?

01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:06.600
Destiny doesn’t come around often, you know.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.400
Try this app. Seriously.

01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:11.920
Destiny might show up in a new form, you know.

01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:18.000
Please make it come true! Amen!

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:23.960
