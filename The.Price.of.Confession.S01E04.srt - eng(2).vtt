00:00:47.068 --> 00:00:50.113
The only grounds for the bail

00:00:50.196 --> 00:00:52.907
was the confession of the murderer
the world calls "Witch."

00:00:52.991 --> 00:00:55.201
Although we respect the court's decision,

00:00:55.285 --> 00:00:59.497
our official position
is that we cannot accept it.

00:01:00.123 --> 00:01:03.209
Is that simply because
it's the confession of a criminal?

00:01:03.793 --> 00:01:05.086
Simply a criminal?

00:01:05.753 --> 00:01:08.756
Isn't this the murderer
you dubbed the "Witch of the Century"

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.801
and kept calling a psychopath?

00:01:15.471 --> 00:01:17.640
What if, as you claim,

00:01:17.724 --> 00:01:21.519
the teacher who has been released
is the real murderer?

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.440
Isn't it dangerous
to let her walk free among the public?

00:01:26.482 --> 00:01:31.279
You said, "What if," but that is exactly
what concerns us the most.

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:33.281
The court is also concerned

00:01:33.364 --> 00:01:36.951
and has ordered an ankle monitor
to be worn as the minimum safety measure.

00:01:37.452 --> 00:01:38.453
Let me remind you.

00:01:38.536 --> 00:01:42.457
An was sentenced to life in prison
in the first trial.

00:01:42.957 --> 00:01:47.503
The trial followed a fair process
strictly based on evidence

00:01:47.587 --> 00:01:49.339
with no exceptions to the rules.

00:01:49.964 --> 00:01:52.383
The prosecution will do
everything in its power

00:01:52.467 --> 00:01:55.345
to ensure the two criminals
never make a mockery

00:01:55.428 --> 00:01:57.263
of the Korean justice system again.

00:01:57.847 --> 00:01:58.932
That will be all.

00:02:01.184 --> 00:02:03.895
What about Baek Dong-hun,
the prosecutor in charge?

00:02:03.978 --> 00:02:06.522
Will he stay on the case?

00:02:06.606 --> 00:02:11.194
There are rumors that his methods
are quite coercive because he's an ex-cop.

00:02:12.487 --> 00:02:15.740
He's a highly valued prosecutor
with very strong principles.

00:02:15.823 --> 00:02:19.744
Of course, we are well aware
of the public criticism he is facing.

00:02:20.286 --> 00:02:24.499
We will prove beyond doubt
that our investigation was not flawed.

00:02:24.582 --> 00:02:26.709
How do you plan to proceed with it?

00:02:26.793 --> 00:02:28.628
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

00:02:31.005 --> 00:02:34.676
Look at this. What an arrogant ass.

00:02:35.176 --> 00:02:37.845
No one has pushed you to quit,
so why jump the gun?

00:02:39.264 --> 00:02:42.934
Accept the outcome,
and move to the CWCU for now.

00:02:43.017 --> 00:02:44.644
It won't be easy there either.

00:02:44.727 --> 00:02:47.981
You know, kids these days commit
the same kind of crimes as adults.

00:02:50.608 --> 00:02:52.235
And maybe in your spare time,

00:02:52.318 --> 00:02:54.821
you can use that diligence of yours
to keep digging.

00:02:55.863 --> 00:02:56.823
Privately.

00:02:59.033 --> 00:02:59.867
Privately?

00:03:00.535 --> 00:03:02.787
Should I say "just for fun," then?

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:07.458
If you find something solid,
you can let me know personally.

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:09.877
That's what you wanted, right?

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:13.089
Now, take this and get out.

00:03:37.864 --> 00:03:38.865
Let's go.

00:03:42.285 --> 00:03:44.412
These people are all on your side.

00:03:48.082 --> 00:03:49.042
YUN-SU, START AFRESH!

00:03:49.125 --> 00:03:50.209
MS. AN! STAY STRONG!

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:53.671
#WE'RE WITH YOU
#REUNITE MOM AND DAUGHTER

00:04:05.892 --> 00:04:07.060
GET LOST, HUSBAND KILLER

00:04:10.063 --> 00:04:11.731
What kind of jerk would…

00:04:14.108 --> 00:04:14.942
MURDERER

00:04:36.714 --> 00:04:37.548
All right.

00:04:38.299 --> 00:04:39.592
These are the last ones.

00:04:40.134 --> 00:04:40.968
There we go.

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:45.390
I don't even know how to thank you.

00:04:45.473 --> 00:04:48.267
It was nothing. I just gave you a hand.

00:04:48.935 --> 00:04:49.769
All right.

00:04:55.316 --> 00:04:56.317
No, Sop. Don't.

00:04:59.737 --> 00:05:01.114
Ms. An?

00:05:01.823 --> 00:05:03.825
-She's here.
-Are you there?

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.080
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:05:09.163 --> 00:05:11.165
-Hello, please come in.
-You know…

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:13.793
I kept circling
when the house was right by the road.

00:05:13.876 --> 00:05:15.461
I'm Ms. An's attorney.

00:05:15.545 --> 00:05:16.796
I'm Bae Sun-deok.

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:19.257
-We spoke on the phone the other day.
-That's right.

00:05:20.258 --> 00:05:21.300
Goodness.

00:05:23.094 --> 00:05:24.303
Did I scare you?

00:05:24.804 --> 00:05:26.848
I'm not a scary person, you know.

00:05:27.432 --> 00:05:28.850
-Okay?
-Sop.

00:05:29.475 --> 00:05:31.477
Can you show me around your room?

00:05:37.316 --> 00:05:38.151
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:05:42.196 --> 00:05:45.616
Make sure you charge it every night
before you go to bed.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.412
A four-hour charge
will give you 24 hours of use.

00:05:49.495 --> 00:05:50.872
It's water-resistant.

00:05:50.955 --> 00:05:55.209
But it's not good to keep it in hot water
for too long, like in public baths.

00:05:55.293 --> 00:05:57.920
And where the device
comes in contact with your ankle,

00:05:58.004 --> 00:06:01.466
like this bone here,
it could cause some chafing.

00:06:01.549 --> 00:06:03.676
So apply some lotion now and then.

00:06:04.802 --> 00:06:05.928
Is that everything?

00:06:07.513 --> 00:06:10.516
I will now install
the electronic monitoring devices.

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:18.566
Here. You need to sign each of these.

00:06:21.277 --> 00:06:22.278
Good heavens.

00:06:28.367 --> 00:06:30.161
Could you maybe

00:06:30.703 --> 00:06:32.872
put that somewhere less visible?

00:06:33.498 --> 00:06:38.377
Nope, it'll be placed
where it's in clear and constant view.

00:06:39.086 --> 00:06:41.506
If there's any signal loss or power loss,

00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:44.842
you're the one who will be penalized.

00:06:49.138 --> 00:06:51.224
You'd like me to go already, wouldn't you?

00:06:52.058 --> 00:06:54.894
Still, you could've offered me
a glass of water.

00:06:54.977 --> 00:06:56.479
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:06:56.562 --> 00:06:58.189
I'll get it for you now.

00:07:02.401 --> 00:07:04.987
Should we discuss the rest outside?

00:07:06.656 --> 00:07:07.490
Yes, please.

00:07:08.282 --> 00:07:11.911
You're not allowed to leave
the boundaries of Paju and Ilsan.

00:07:11.994 --> 00:07:15.623
If you ever need to,
you must get permission in advance.

00:07:15.706 --> 00:07:19.126
Ideally, it's best
not to have to do that in the first place.

00:07:19.627 --> 00:07:25.007
Actually, your boundary was extended
due to your child's kindergarten commute.

00:07:25.675 --> 00:07:31.806
And you're not allowed to leave your house
between 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.

00:07:31.889 --> 00:07:34.183
The moment you step outside
your front door,

00:07:34.267 --> 00:07:36.477
the control center will be alerted.

00:07:39.146 --> 00:07:41.315
So I'm not allowed to do anything.

00:07:41.816 --> 00:07:46.153
You see, many people make the mistake

00:07:46.237 --> 00:07:49.615
of thinking that they're free
once they're out.

00:07:49.699 --> 00:07:51.993
Don't forget who you are.

00:07:52.076 --> 00:07:55.705
You're still a murder suspect.

00:07:55.788 --> 00:07:57.582
Always be careful.

00:07:58.082 --> 00:07:59.292
And stay vigilant.

00:08:02.962 --> 00:08:03.921
-Hey.
-Hi.

00:08:04.463 --> 00:08:06.299
-What is it?
-Sop said she's hungry.

00:08:06.382 --> 00:08:08.217
Sure. What do you want to eat?

00:08:09.594 --> 00:08:10.678
Chapagetti, please.

00:08:11.429 --> 00:08:14.015
Chapagetti? Coming right up.

00:08:14.765 --> 00:08:16.434
-I'll get going, then.
-Okay.

00:08:17.101 --> 00:08:18.185
Let's see.

00:08:18.269 --> 00:08:19.895
Here you go.

00:08:19.979 --> 00:08:21.564
Would you like a chocolate?

00:08:21.647 --> 00:08:22.523
Hey…

00:08:24.692 --> 00:08:25.610
-Here.
-Right…

00:08:25.693 --> 00:08:27.653
She doesn't really have a sweet tooth.

00:08:27.737 --> 00:08:28.779
I see.

00:08:28.863 --> 00:08:29.697
Bye.

00:08:30.656 --> 00:08:31.574
Let's go inside.

00:08:31.657 --> 00:08:32.491
Go ahead.

00:08:38.873 --> 00:08:40.541
I'd better get going now.

00:08:41.417 --> 00:08:46.797
If it's okay with you,
would you like to stay for dinner?

00:08:46.881 --> 00:08:48.883
I'm fine, thank you.
I have some work to do.

00:08:48.966 --> 00:08:51.469
But you probably skipped lunch.

00:08:51.552 --> 00:08:54.513
You should spend
some quality time with Sop today.

00:08:54.597 --> 00:08:55.640
Goodbye.

00:08:55.723 --> 00:08:58.059
-I'll see you, Sop. Bye.
-Take care.

00:08:58.142 --> 00:08:59.268
-You too.
-Bye.

00:09:00.186 --> 00:09:01.020
Bye.

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:20.790
I told you, didn't I?

00:09:20.873 --> 00:09:23.125
All the instant noodles are down here.

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:27.338
Go sit with Sop. I'll make it.

00:09:58.202 --> 00:09:59.036
Here.

00:10:00.621 --> 00:10:01.831
Wait.

00:10:02.748 --> 00:10:03.582
Well…

00:10:03.666 --> 00:10:06.794
I went around the shared cells first,
so the water cooled.

00:10:07.545 --> 00:10:09.338
Could you get some medicine for me?

00:10:10.089 --> 00:10:11.257
Medicine?

00:10:13.884 --> 00:10:17.680
You know you have to consult
the medical officer first, don't you?

00:10:18.431 --> 00:10:21.058
I can't sleep at night.

00:10:21.934 --> 00:10:22.810
Right.

00:10:22.893 --> 00:10:24.186
Can you let go…

00:10:26.272 --> 00:10:29.316
Can you also get me a newspaper?

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.777
This evening's would be even better.

00:10:32.653 --> 00:10:34.739
I'll ask the supervisor.

00:10:38.409 --> 00:10:39.452
Please.

00:10:40.453 --> 00:10:42.121
-The paper.
-Okay.

00:10:42.663 --> 00:10:44.039
Can you…

00:11:01.932 --> 00:11:02.933
Is it that good?

00:11:03.517 --> 00:11:04.977
Yes, it is.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.063
Have some water while you eat.

00:11:12.151 --> 00:11:14.612
Look at you speaking so politely now.

00:11:14.695 --> 00:11:15.738
Yes, Mom.

00:11:18.783 --> 00:11:19.617
Here, let me.

00:11:29.835 --> 00:11:32.338
It's nice that you're speaking politely,

00:11:33.047 --> 00:11:35.758
but I liked it better before
when we were like friends.

00:11:39.053 --> 00:11:40.054
Are you done?

00:11:40.763 --> 00:11:42.473
Should we go brushy-brush?

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:45.684
Come on.

00:12:48.914 --> 00:12:49.832
I'm sorry.

00:13:12.021 --> 00:13:13.772
Sop must be asleep.

00:13:19.737 --> 00:13:20.696
I'm sorry.

00:13:22.656 --> 00:13:24.450
I know you're already hurt.

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:28.037
And I'm apologizing
to make myself feel better.

00:13:29.705 --> 00:13:31.332
But I still want to apologize.

00:13:37.379 --> 00:13:39.006
Why don't you just hit me instead?

00:13:40.174 --> 00:13:42.676
I know it won't make everything better.

00:13:43.177 --> 00:13:45.304
But if it's of any comfort to you…

00:14:02.404 --> 00:14:03.530
I'm sorry, Yun-su.

00:14:04.615 --> 00:14:06.784
Oh my God. I'm so sorry.

00:14:15.668 --> 00:14:18.003
I bought some tteokbokki from Mi-suk's.

00:14:20.506 --> 00:14:21.632
What about beer?

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:25.678
That too.

00:14:34.395 --> 00:14:36.313
You painted the walls, didn't you?

00:14:38.524 --> 00:14:40.567
I made my husband do it.

00:14:41.068 --> 00:14:42.319
And got groceries too?

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:45.155
Sop never skips breakfast, you know.

00:14:47.408 --> 00:14:50.035
I took your car to the repair shop.

00:14:50.536 --> 00:14:52.246
It's a bigger job than expected.

00:14:52.329 --> 00:14:54.456
You can pick it up tomorrow
or the day after.

00:14:57.501 --> 00:14:59.420
The taxi must be here.

00:14:59.503 --> 00:15:01.588
Hey, you should go in.

00:15:01.672 --> 00:15:03.716
-Wait.
-Just leave it. I'll clean it up.

00:15:03.799 --> 00:15:05.175
All right, then.

00:15:05.259 --> 00:15:07.428
-Hold on.
-You should go inside now.

00:15:07.511 --> 00:15:09.096
Why is it here already?

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:14.852
Just go in. If Sop wakes up
and you're not there, she'll get scared.

00:15:19.815 --> 00:15:22.151
Give her a big hug before you go to bed.

00:15:22.735 --> 00:15:23.569
Okay.

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:29.825
It's here. See you later.

00:16:02.524 --> 00:16:03.984
About your husband…

00:16:05.319 --> 00:16:06.737
I'll confess

00:16:08.155 --> 00:16:09.448
to killing him.

00:16:10.074 --> 00:16:11.116
TEACHER RELEASED ON BAIL

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.910
It's not for free, of course.

00:16:14.244 --> 00:16:17.164
There's something
you need to do for me too.

00:16:19.458 --> 00:16:20.751
There is…

00:16:22.878 --> 00:16:25.214
someone I didn't get to kill that day.

00:16:27.174 --> 00:16:28.759
When you get out there…

00:16:31.178 --> 00:16:33.472
I want you to kill that person for me.

00:17:09.842 --> 00:17:12.136
ILSAN DENTIST COUPLE MURDER

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:23.313
Answer just one question!

00:17:24.314 --> 00:17:26.400
The deceased couple had a son.

00:17:26.483 --> 00:17:28.735
Anything to say to the boy left all alone?

00:17:30.195 --> 00:17:35.117
I'm sure you know, but your mom and dad
weren't exactly good people.

00:17:35.701 --> 00:17:37.661
Blame your parents

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:40.289
for making you pay the price.

00:17:42.457 --> 00:17:44.293
You'd do anything…

00:17:46.461 --> 00:17:48.881
for your daughter, wouldn't you?

00:17:52.551 --> 00:17:56.305
HOTPICK'S TOP-RANKED STORY UNPACKED:
THE ILSAN DENTIST COUPLE MURDER CASE

00:18:05.772 --> 00:18:08.817
VICTIMS' SON, FIRST REPORTER AND WITNESS,
WAS AT THE SCENE OF CRIME

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:25.125
How do you want to die?

00:18:25.209 --> 00:18:26.877
Please help me.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.296
-No, come on.
-I have to go home!

00:18:29.379 --> 00:18:30.547
-No, come on.
-I have to…

00:18:52.152 --> 00:18:53.445
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:18:53.528 --> 00:18:55.364
Sop, slow down. Don't forget your bag.

00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:00.160
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:19:00.744 --> 00:19:02.537
-Here's her bag.
-Move!

00:19:03.789 --> 00:19:05.249
Please don't take it personally.

00:19:05.332 --> 00:19:07.626
She's just excited
to see her friends again.

00:19:07.709 --> 00:19:09.670
I'm just grateful she's smiling like that.

00:19:10.295 --> 00:19:11.546
It's good to see you again.

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:14.716
It's great to see you and Sop again.

00:19:15.592 --> 00:19:17.052
Please take good care of her.

00:19:19.096 --> 00:19:20.973
Sop, you forgot your bag.

00:19:21.056 --> 00:19:22.432
…lose. Rock, paper, scissors.

00:19:23.767 --> 00:19:24.601
You won.

00:19:24.685 --> 00:19:25.894
Hello.

00:20:11.732 --> 00:20:12.691
Hey!

00:20:22.617 --> 00:20:23.994
-Oh my God.
-Really?

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:28.332
-No way.
-It's that woman who killed her husband.

00:20:28.832 --> 00:20:29.666
Goodness.

00:20:32.377 --> 00:20:33.545
Oh my God.

00:20:39.718 --> 00:20:41.053
That'll be 26,500 won.

00:21:00.947 --> 00:21:02.115
I'm sorry.

00:21:06.411 --> 00:21:07.913
People look at me in one of two ways.

00:21:07.996 --> 00:21:09.081
JANG JEONG-GU LAW OFFICE

00:21:09.164 --> 00:21:11.375
Either cautiously or curiously.

00:21:12.626 --> 00:21:16.129
The whole world seems to know how many
times a month I slept with my husband.

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:20.926
When you're a distant figure,
people offer sympathy and support.

00:21:21.009 --> 00:21:22.928
But when you're actually in front of them,

00:21:23.637 --> 00:21:25.138
they're scared

00:21:25.222 --> 00:21:26.765
and also curious.

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:29.309
You saw this coming.

00:21:30.102 --> 00:21:30.936
Yeah.

00:21:32.479 --> 00:21:34.147
When is my appeal?

00:21:36.525 --> 00:21:37.901
It's in three weeks.

00:21:38.485 --> 00:21:39.319
Three weeks?

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:41.530
The prosecution seems to be rushing.

00:21:41.613 --> 00:21:44.533
They'll never give in.

00:21:44.616 --> 00:21:48.954
They'll try to tear you down
and drag you through the mud.

00:21:50.622 --> 00:21:52.541
I won't go down without a fight.

00:21:53.583 --> 00:21:56.211
I'll also find the person
who killed my husband.

00:21:59.297 --> 00:22:00.424
But the killer

00:22:01.466 --> 00:22:02.551
already confessed.

00:22:06.346 --> 00:22:07.806
That woman…

00:22:10.267 --> 00:22:12.436
can't be trusted.
If she suddenly denies it…

00:22:12.519 --> 00:22:14.646
I don't intend to rely on
her confession alone.

00:22:15.397 --> 00:22:19.401
I'll find proof that you're not the killer

00:22:19.985 --> 00:22:20.986
and that she is.

00:22:27.159 --> 00:22:29.744
Inmate 407, the medicine you asked for.

00:22:50.098 --> 00:22:51.016
Confirmed.

00:22:53.226 --> 00:22:54.561
Another public defender

00:22:55.729 --> 00:22:57.898
refused to take your case
for personal reasons.

00:22:58.482 --> 00:22:59.774
This is the fourth time.

00:23:02.319 --> 00:23:03.153
Just

00:23:04.237 --> 00:23:05.197
so you know.

00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:02.837
What can I get you?

00:24:04.673 --> 00:24:06.132
The yukgaejang here is good.

00:24:07.884 --> 00:24:09.135
Yukgaejang, please.

00:24:09.636 --> 00:24:10.929
I'll have janchi-guksu.

00:24:11.805 --> 00:24:12.639
Sure.

00:24:33.451 --> 00:24:34.828
How does it feel being out?

00:24:41.668 --> 00:24:43.378
You actually look more drawn.

00:24:46.881 --> 00:24:49.676
I heard you moved to a new team.
Is this personal curiosity?

00:24:52.012 --> 00:24:54.180
You sure make people feel uncomfortable.

00:24:57.726 --> 00:25:01.021
I like it when people feel
uncomfortable around me.

00:25:01.938 --> 00:25:03.481
It makes my job easier.

00:25:05.942 --> 00:25:07.527
You show off a lot, don't you?

00:25:14.909 --> 00:25:15.744
Ms. An.

00:25:18.246 --> 00:25:20.040
Yes, Prosecutor Baek Dong-hun.

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:22.959
You're still a murder suspect.

00:25:23.043 --> 00:25:26.504
It could be the circumstances
making you feel uncomfortable, not me.

00:25:27.339 --> 00:25:28.965
What makes you so certain

00:25:29.633 --> 00:25:30.508
that I did it?

00:25:31.468 --> 00:25:33.053
What would you know?

00:25:36.765 --> 00:25:37.974
I just believe it.

00:25:46.316 --> 00:25:47.233
Thanks for the meal.

00:25:58.036 --> 00:25:59.120
Long time no see.

00:26:00.955 --> 00:26:02.332
It's been a while, Ms. Eom.

00:26:02.832 --> 00:26:05.960
Professor, I thought you'd stopped
taking public defense cases.

00:26:06.044 --> 00:26:08.129
Yeah, I somehow ended up back here again.

00:26:08.213 --> 00:26:11.341
I did wonder what it would be like
if you were here.

00:26:11.925 --> 00:26:13.802
But it won't be easy.

00:26:14.302 --> 00:26:16.638
Well, I have braced myself for it.

00:26:17.138 --> 00:26:18.056
Shall we?

00:26:29.484 --> 00:26:31.653
I heard everyone was avoiding me.

00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:35.198
What made you step up to defend me?

00:26:37.909 --> 00:26:39.786
I did volunteer.

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:43.873
But I don't think "step up"
is the right way to put it.

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:46.584
To be honest,

00:26:47.085 --> 00:26:49.170
it was my wife's suggestion.

00:26:49.838 --> 00:26:54.342
She said your confession gave someone
a chance to clear their name,

00:26:55.885 --> 00:26:57.470
and I agreed.

00:27:01.182 --> 00:27:02.559
Do you…

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:07.856
believe my confession?

00:27:09.983 --> 00:27:11.401
Am I not supposed to?

00:27:13.319 --> 00:27:15.739
Some people don't.

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:18.491
Like the prosecutors.

00:27:18.992 --> 00:27:21.077
I can see why from their perspective.

00:27:21.619 --> 00:27:26.666
Some sit in front of me,
hoping to build their careers.

00:27:31.045 --> 00:27:34.132
Am I being interviewed right now?

00:27:34.215 --> 00:27:37.761
Or are you trying to wear me down
or something like that?

00:27:39.929 --> 00:27:40.764
No, I'm not.

00:27:43.975 --> 00:27:45.810
If I had a personal agenda,

00:27:45.894 --> 00:27:48.438
I would've gone to An Yun-su.

00:27:49.147 --> 00:27:52.442
For the record,
I already have a solid career.

00:27:58.281 --> 00:27:59.908
Now it's my turn to ask.

00:28:01.618 --> 00:28:04.454
Can I trust you, Ms. Mo?

00:28:08.708 --> 00:28:09.876
Can I trust you?

00:28:13.296 --> 00:28:14.214
Sure.

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:27.101
Ms. Eom.

00:28:27.644 --> 00:28:31.272
Inmate 407 seems to be writing a letter.
Shouldn't we go check?

00:28:32.065 --> 00:28:33.817
Censoring letters is illegal.

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:36.152
Besides, Attorney Jin won't allow us.

00:29:03.555 --> 00:29:05.557
Please give this to An Yun-su.

00:29:08.351 --> 00:29:11.187
If it's related to the trial,
it could cause a problem later.

00:29:12.438 --> 00:29:14.941
Can I ask what it's about?

00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:17.777
You'll read it anyway.

00:29:19.028 --> 00:29:19.904
Sorry?

00:29:21.865 --> 00:29:23.950
It'll be yard time soon.

00:29:25.159 --> 00:29:26.744
Can we finish up now?

00:29:27.412 --> 00:29:29.247
It's the only time I get to see the sun.

00:29:31.332 --> 00:29:32.166
Sure.

00:29:35.378 --> 00:29:37.547
You're still in solitary, aren't you?

00:29:39.507 --> 00:29:42.218
I'll arrange to have you moved
to the general block.

00:29:42.302 --> 00:29:45.388
It won't happen right away,
but it should be possible by next week.

00:29:46.639 --> 00:29:48.474
I didn't expect this.

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:50.435
Thank you.

00:29:54.814 --> 00:29:57.567
You seem happy with the lawyer this time.

00:29:58.568 --> 00:30:01.529
You've never spent so long
talking to a lawyer.

00:30:06.451 --> 00:30:08.870
I heard he's written a book.

00:30:09.412 --> 00:30:10.914
Can you get me a copy?

00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:28.181
One hundred and eighty.

00:31:34.706 --> 00:31:37.166
Who said you could sit there,
goddamn bitch?

00:31:39.043 --> 00:31:40.461
Hey, Pudgy.

00:31:41.963 --> 00:31:43.214
Seriously?

00:31:44.298 --> 00:31:45.383
Hey!

00:31:46.634 --> 00:31:49.637
Didn't I tell you
not to let just anyone sit here?

00:31:50.847 --> 00:31:51.681
Oh no.

00:31:53.349 --> 00:31:55.101
You're not allowed to sit there.

00:31:55.768 --> 00:31:57.020
Aren't you gonna get up?

00:32:04.444 --> 00:32:05.278
What?

00:32:06.195 --> 00:32:07.405
Got a fucking problem?

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:12.035
No.

00:32:12.869 --> 00:32:14.912
Look at this bitch. You little…

00:32:15.955 --> 00:32:17.248
Damn. Hey!

00:32:17.331 --> 00:32:19.459
Don't mess with her.
Go pick on some other girl.

00:32:20.001 --> 00:32:23.171
-What's with the whispering?
-Forget it. Just keep walking.

00:32:23.254 --> 00:32:24.839
Why? Who the hell is she?

00:32:26.049 --> 00:32:27.925
She's that Witch.

00:32:29.093 --> 00:32:29.927
Her?

00:32:30.845 --> 00:32:33.890
Damn it. She looks like fucking nothing.

00:32:54.452 --> 00:32:57.330
CITY GAS SAFETY INSPECTION NOTICE

00:33:05.755 --> 00:33:06.923
PICK UP SOP

00:33:17.058 --> 00:33:19.519
-Mom!
-I'm sorry I'm late.

00:33:20.019 --> 00:33:21.312
I'm sorry, ma'am.

00:33:22.313 --> 00:33:24.357
-Thanks.
-You can ask me to watch her.

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.150
I like spending time with Sop.

00:33:27.068 --> 00:33:27.902
Thank you.

00:33:27.985 --> 00:33:29.153
Have a nice day.

00:33:30.071 --> 00:33:31.823
Say goodbye to your teacher.

00:33:31.906 --> 00:33:34.033
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

00:33:34.117 --> 00:33:35.118
Good girl.

00:34:02.478 --> 00:34:03.980
-Mom.
-Yeah?

00:34:04.605 --> 00:34:06.399
Where are we going?

00:34:07.066 --> 00:34:08.693
We're going home, of course.

00:34:11.654 --> 00:34:12.822
Get some more sleep, Sop.

00:34:13.739 --> 00:34:15.950
I got a call from Mo Eun's attorney.

00:34:16.033 --> 00:34:19.162
He's got a letter for you.
He's coming to my office tomorrow.

00:34:20.663 --> 00:34:22.623
I was hoping someone would take the case.

00:34:22.707 --> 00:34:23.666
Here it is.

00:34:25.168 --> 00:34:28.087
I never imagined
it'd be Attorney Jin Young-in.

00:34:28.171 --> 00:34:29.005
Here.

00:34:29.714 --> 00:34:30.631
This is him.

00:34:31.174 --> 00:34:34.051
He did all the legwork himself
when he took on cases

00:34:34.135 --> 00:34:36.721
involving underprivileged victims
even the police disregarded.

00:34:37.221 --> 00:34:39.932
Reading this book,
not to mention his last one,

00:34:40.516 --> 00:34:42.435
I wondered if I could ever do what he did.

00:34:43.436 --> 00:34:47.064
There are thank-you letters
from his clients at the end.

00:34:47.148 --> 00:34:48.691
They made me really jealous.

00:34:52.653 --> 00:34:53.487
Hello, Mr. Jin.

00:34:54.697 --> 00:34:55.781
Are you here?

00:34:56.282 --> 00:35:00.119
Yes, you can park there
and just come up to the second floor.

00:35:00.203 --> 00:35:01.913
Yes, great.

00:35:01.996 --> 00:35:03.206
He's here.

00:35:05.416 --> 00:35:07.168
He's got a nice car.

00:35:08.794 --> 00:35:11.422
He's got a beautiful wife too.

00:35:18.971 --> 00:35:22.183
He's had over 1,000 criminal cases
in ten years as a public defender.

00:35:22.266 --> 00:35:23.226
He's a total expert.

00:35:23.809 --> 00:35:25.478
Why would someone like him take on--

00:35:25.561 --> 00:35:28.814
I'm sure he'll help ease
some of your anxiety.

00:35:29.315 --> 00:35:30.608
Don't worry too much.

00:35:35.988 --> 00:35:38.532
She wrote it on the spot
during our consultation.

00:35:39.033 --> 00:35:41.786
She seemed to have a lot to say.
She wouldn't stop writing.

00:35:45.373 --> 00:35:48.793
Would you have read it, by any chance?

00:35:50.628 --> 00:35:51.879
No, I didn't.

00:35:53.965 --> 00:35:57.885
Well, trust is the most important thing
between a lawyer and their client.

00:35:57.969 --> 00:35:59.262
Without my client's consent,

00:36:00.221 --> 00:36:01.430
I'd never read it.

00:36:04.642 --> 00:36:06.018
I'll get going now.

00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:08.312
I'll keep in touch through Mr. Jang.

00:36:08.396 --> 00:36:09.814
Thank you.

00:36:09.897 --> 00:36:11.440
Thank you for today. Take care.

00:36:14.944 --> 00:36:16.028
About that letter,

00:36:16.112 --> 00:36:18.531
please let me know
if there's anything suspicious.

00:36:18.614 --> 00:36:20.408
We need the trial to run smoothly.

00:36:20.491 --> 00:36:22.535
Okay, I will. I'll get going now.

00:36:23.494 --> 00:36:24.662
-See you later.
-Bye.

00:36:35.673 --> 00:36:41.429
What would you say is the biggest change
the COVID pandemic has caused in society?

00:36:42.054 --> 00:36:43.931
Well, there were many changes.

00:36:44.015 --> 00:36:46.642
In particular, the rise
of contact-free lifestyle stood out

00:36:46.726 --> 00:36:48.978
with the implementation
of social distancing.

00:36:49.478 --> 00:36:53.941
Even once the measures were lifted,
people were used to living contact-free.

00:36:54.025 --> 00:36:54.859
Yun-su,

00:36:55.609 --> 00:36:57.445
how's life on the outside?

00:36:58.070 --> 00:37:01.073
Are you enjoying
your time with your daughter?

00:37:02.283 --> 00:37:04.160
Although I'm in prison,

00:37:04.744 --> 00:37:09.832
I'll always watch you and root for you,
wherever you are and whatever you do.

00:37:20.885 --> 00:37:23.971
I heard your trial is in three weeks.

00:37:24.472 --> 00:37:26.640
I hope the preparations are going well.

00:37:27.391 --> 00:37:30.353
I'm going to take the stand
as a witness that day.

00:37:31.062 --> 00:37:34.815
I'll tell the truth
with a repentant heart.

00:37:36.359 --> 00:37:39.779
I sincerely hope
you'll walk out of the courtroom

00:37:40.446 --> 00:37:42.323
with a smile on your face.

00:39:07.283 --> 00:39:08.200
Who are you?

00:39:48.616 --> 00:39:49.492
Sop.

00:39:50.075 --> 00:39:51.619
Sop!

00:39:51.702 --> 00:39:53.787
Sop, open your eyes!

00:39:56.332 --> 00:39:58.125
Sop! Open your eyes!

00:39:58.209 --> 00:39:59.335
Sop! Open…

00:40:20.147 --> 00:40:25.194
Since COVID-19, mental health issues
have become a major concern.

00:40:25.277 --> 00:40:27.863
What are your thoughts
on this social phenomenon?

00:40:29.156 --> 00:40:33.160
COVID-19 caused
psychological stress for many.

00:40:33.244 --> 00:40:35.246
Due to self-isolation
and social distancing,

00:40:35.829 --> 00:40:38.541
many people began to feel
lonely and disconnected.

00:40:39.416 --> 00:40:42.419
Based on the national survey
by the Ministry of Health and Welfare,

00:40:42.503 --> 00:40:46.465
about 38% of the population experienced
depression due to COVID-19--

00:40:48.384 --> 00:40:49.426
Hello?

00:40:49.969 --> 00:40:52.555
Is something wrong? You sound…

00:40:53.973 --> 00:40:56.183
No, I'd fallen asleep.

00:40:56.267 --> 00:40:58.978
By any chance, did you read the letter?

00:40:59.478 --> 00:41:00.729
Yes, I did.

00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:03.482
Can I ask what it said?

00:41:04.149 --> 00:41:06.402
She said she'll testify as a witness
at my trial.

00:41:06.485 --> 00:41:07.570
At your trial?

00:41:07.653 --> 00:41:10.281
She'll tell the truth
with a repentant heart.

00:41:10.364 --> 00:41:11.574
I see.

00:41:12.074 --> 00:41:13.284
And then

00:41:14.868 --> 00:41:16.954
she just asked how I was doing.

00:41:17.037 --> 00:41:18.330
Thank God.

00:41:18.998 --> 00:41:20.499
Sorry for calling so late. Night.

00:41:20.583 --> 00:41:21.458
Good night.

00:43:59.742 --> 00:44:03.120
NIGHT CURFEW VIOLATION
AN YUN-SU

00:44:12.838 --> 00:44:14.673
Hello, Bae Sun-deok speaking.

00:44:16.842 --> 00:44:17.718
What?

00:44:18.302 --> 00:44:19.428
An Yun-su did what?

00:45:31.333 --> 00:45:32.709
By the way,

00:45:34.044 --> 00:45:37.756
even if you get out,
don't get any funny ideas.

00:45:39.174 --> 00:45:41.343
Don't get caught up

00:45:42.511 --> 00:45:45.556
in luxuries you can't afford,
like chasing after the truth.

00:46:10.539 --> 00:46:13.000
Emergency! An inmate has escaped!

00:46:15.919 --> 00:46:18.547
Because wherever you are
or whatever you're doing,

00:46:20.465 --> 00:46:23.510
I'll always be watching you.

00:50:12.989 --> 00:50:17.994
