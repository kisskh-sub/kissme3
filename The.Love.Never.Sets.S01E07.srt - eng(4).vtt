Mud, Ice is here!

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.080
Ice.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.320
Are you hurt?

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.880
I want you to know

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.600
that I'll always be by your side

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.000
As a friend or whatever.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.440
Shall we throw a beach party?

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.400
Yes!

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.480
Sorry, it won’t happen again.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.080
Forget it.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.640
You’re drunk.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.200
Saint? Ice?

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.040
Have you seen Lanee?

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.120
We’re looking for her too.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.080
If something happens,

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.440
who’s gonna take responsibility?

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.080
I said let go!

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.320
What are you doing to Lanee?!

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.320
Let's break up.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.840
Ice.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.200
I'm sorry.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.680
I need to be alone.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.000
(SAINT)

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.000
I know you want to be alone.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.440
But you've locked yourself away since last night.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.400
At least...

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.479
You should come out and have something to eat.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.400
Ice.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.360
Everyone is worried about you.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.600
Do you know that?

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.720
I have something I want to give you.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.120
I know that you're sad

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.360
but...

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.520
I don't want you to think of doing something bad.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.800
I'm fine.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.480
Ok.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.000
Come out when you're ready.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.280
Or if you don't want to come out

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.240
because you don't want to see my face

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:43.960
that's fine too.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.880
So you can come out of your room?

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.560
Huh?

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.240
Sea? Why are you here?

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.840
You still have the nerve to ask that?

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.960
You’ve been locking yourself in your room for days.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.000
Of course, people are worried

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.200
you might do something bad.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.240
I thought you quit.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.880
Just smoke when I’m stressed.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.320
It’s my emotional support.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.160
What’s making you so sad?

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.280
You love Warm that much?

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.960
It’s because I don’t love him

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.120
that I’m this hurt.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.480
You know, I feel like absolute shit.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.360
What Warm said was right.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.440
I’m his boyfriend,

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.680
but I only ever hang out with Saint.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.280
Whatever I do, I just think about Saint.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.440
I don’t even know what

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.120
Warm likes to do or eat.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.240
I liked him because

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.920
he was there for me when I needed someone.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:48.360
I really am selfish, just like he said.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.120
Yeah.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.600
He wasn’t wrong about that.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.600
But don’t forget to step back

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.080
and look at the bigger picture.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.360
All this time,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.880
Warm used you too

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.560
when you had no one else.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.760
If he didn’t talk about all his positive attributes

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.080
you wouldn’t have given in to him that much.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:11.680
Still,

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.240
I really was in the wrong.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:13.800
Argh.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.560
Stop.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.760
It’s over, let it be over.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.680
Even now,

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.000
you’re still letting him mess with your head,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.560
don’t you see?

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:30.560
You know, people can

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.600
stay and wallow with sadness

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.240
but don’t let it be for too long.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.680
Thanks for always being there for me.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.880
It’s not just me who’s here for you.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:53.640
There are plenty of people who care about you too.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.720
Don’t overthink it.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.280
I don’t get it.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.960
I think my taste’s pretty good,

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.800
how the hell did I end up liking Mud?

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.320
That guy acts like

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.800
he’s got just one wrinkle in his brain.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:12.760
He’s loud, blunt,

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.000
doesn’t care about anyone’s feelings.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.840
I swear, I really wanna stop liking him.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.240
You like Mud?

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.240
Then why did you kiss Prite at the party?

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.520
Because Mud kissed someone else first.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.520
I just…

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.920
acted on impulse.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.480
Yeah, I know, I was an asshole

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.800
for doing that out of spite.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.160
But after that day, I realized…

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.000
I really liked him.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.720
So I immediately stopped talking to Prite.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:43.120
If only Sea were blunt

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.280
then maybe we could actually talk.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.120
Oh please.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.680
You post statuses with Saint,

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.800
then you’re caught kissing Warm a few days later.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.280
Of course she doesn’t wanna talk to you.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.880
Ugh, I’m gonna lose my mind.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.800
Can we not bring that up again?

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.680
I’ve rinsed my mouth like a hundred times already.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.360
That’s why I’m not drinking today.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.280
And that cake,

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.440
are you really gonna keep it?

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.440
Yeah.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.080
I’m saving it for Sea.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.800
Then why not go talk to her directly?

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.560
Sea probably doesn’t wanna talk to me anymore.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.280
But that day,

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.560
wasn’t she the one taking care of you?

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.760
After that whole fight with Warm?

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:31.480
Yeah, she even helped her into the van.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.560
Wait, really?

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.480
Yeah.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.000
I blacked out, I don’t remember a thing.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.240
Then maybe I should try to bump into her.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.280
Hello.

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:53.200
Woo!

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.120
Hello everyone!

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:58.360
Welcome to Midnight with Warm Voice!

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.800
Woo!

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.360
Tonight, I’m singing this song to win someone back.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.360
This bastard…

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:03.880
He’s everywhere.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:06.520
But can I ask everyone here for a favor?

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.800
Please take out your phones,

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.960
record this performance and post it

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.880
on every social media you have.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:13.960
Okay!

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.560
Make it go viral, okay?

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.080
Okay! Okay!

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.800
When you’re sad,

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.040
I’m always by your side.

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.080
But when you found someone new,

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.800
you left me behind,

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.640
all alone.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:39.520
There’s something I want to say about relationships.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.120
When two people fight,

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.760
the one who apologizes first,

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.160
it doesn’t mean they lose.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.360
It means they love the other person more.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.280
Woo!

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:51.160
Right?

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:52.000
RIGHT!

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.560
So tonight, I’m singing this song

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:58.560
to tell that person.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:11:59.840
Ice.

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.440
Please come back to me.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.960
Woah.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.160
Ugh…

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.240
When will you stop bothering Ice already?

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.920
You again?

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:15.400
Still can’t stop messing with me, huh?

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.080
I'm trying to win my boyfriend back with a guitar

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.520
and get back what's mine.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.200
Even that guitar belongs to him.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.480
Stop pretending everything’s yours.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.080
What’s your problem?

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.840
This guitar, Ice gave it to me.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.120
You don’t know shit.

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.600
Do you even know?

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.040
Before your name ever came along,

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.600
that flower carved on it was something I drew for him.

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.280
Don’t you know how much Ice is sick of you?

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:26.960
So?

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.360
Why?

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.480
I’m still gonna win him back.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.440
Hey!

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.000
No filming!

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:36.800
Don't!

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:37.600
Stop it!

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:38.680
What the hell is wrong with you?

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.720
Anyone who records, I’ll sue for PDPA violations!

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.880
But he’s a public figure, isn’t he?

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.080
Why can’t we film?

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.560
Celebrities are still people, sweetie.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.360
Give him some space.

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.000
Go on! Film it!

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.360
Hello, Ice?

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.480
Something big just happened.

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.840
Warm and Saint are about to fight!

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:57.600
What?

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.600
Get here fast!

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.280
I gotta hang up.

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.360
Then how about this? You and me, one on one, right now.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:20.920
Clear this up.

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:22.240
If I win,

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.600
I get the guitar

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.520
and I’m taking my boyfriend back.

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:26.120
Fine.

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:28.200
But if you lose,

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.440
I take the guitar,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.240
and...

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:34.880
you stop stealing credit for Ice’s songs.

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:36.440
Deal.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.520
You think I’m scared of you?

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.040
So what are we dueling with, huh?

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:42.920
Since we’re already at the bar,

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.120
how about a drinking duel?

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:47.280
Saint, don’t be an idiot, man.

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.960
You can’t hold your liquor.

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.320
Huh?

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.360
What’s wrong?

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.480
You scared?

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.240
Come on, man.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.440
You’re weak.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.080
I’ll handle it. Fine.

00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:58.880
I’m in.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:00.640
Miss Aor?

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.520
Could you close the shop for us first?

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.280
Don’t worry about the cost,

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.160
I'll will take care of it.

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:09.280
Please?

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:10.560
Pretty please?

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:12.560
We’re all friends here.

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.680
Alright, I’ll handle it for you.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.400
Sure. Okay, thanks.

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.200
Sure thing.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.200
Everyone!

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.040
The shop’s closed now!

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:23.000
Closed! Huh?

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.200
Wow, what’s going on? No worries.

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:30.240
The first round of the Golden Throat Challenge begins!

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.240
If you’re ready…

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.200
Three!

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.040
Two!

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:34.720
One!

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.800
Go!

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:38.280
Here we go.

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:39.200
One down!

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.360
Take it easy, or you’ll get knocked out.

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.040
Maybe give up now, huh?

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.440
If someone’s not meant for you,

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.120
nothing you do will make it work.

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:51.360
What did he just say?

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:52.840
Everything he's saying is so about him.

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:54.160
Second round!

00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:57.640
This one’s called

00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:59.640
Breaking the Elephant’s Tusk

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:01.680
This round’s intense.

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.360
You better watch yourself.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.760
If you’re ready…

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:05.520
Three!

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:06.040
Two!

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:06.520
One!

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:07.440
Go!

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:20.600
You’re so weak,

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.240
go home and drink milk.

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:28.480
The third round is called

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.520
The Naga’s Demon Hunt

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.840
If you can handle it, go on!

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:33.680
Three!

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:34.160
Two!

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:34.720
One!

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:35.760
Go!

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.360
Woo!

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.440
Still holding up,

00:16:58.800 --> 00:16:59.760
huh?

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:01.040
You can quit anytime, you know.

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:05.520
You good, man?

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.000
Hey?

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.040
He’s still drinking?

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:12.520
I can’t even think of a name for the next set.

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:14.119
What do we do now?

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.920
You sure you’re good?

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.000
Oh..

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Guess not.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.920
Oh my god.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:36.960
Okay.

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:38.880
Alright, alright!

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:41.000
The winner is…

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Saint!

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.920
Fabulous.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:50.920
Tch.

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:54.920
Pathetic!

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.000
You really think after all this…

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.840
he’s gonna accept you?

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:00.880
Do as you promised.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.320
Promised what?

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:03.280
Where’s your proof?

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:04.440
When did I ever make a deal with you?

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:05.640
Where’s the evidence?

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:06.320
Where’s the promise?

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.040
If you’ve got nothing, it’s invalid.

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:08.880
Huh?

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:11.760
Hey! Give it back!

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:13.520
Warm!

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.000
Ice?

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.240
Ice, how did you get here?

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:18.560
You came to see me?

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.240
Come on.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:21.720
Let’s go back to our condo.

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.640
Oh my god!

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.000
The things you gave me…

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:30.520
I’m returning them.

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.040
From now on,

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:34.080
we have nothing to do with each other.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.000
What?

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:35.840
I’m not taking them back!

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:36.600
No.

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.640
We’re done.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.560
You’re so damn annoying.

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:48.880
Why do you love each other so much?

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:49.640
Ah! Hey!

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:50.160
Hey!

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:53.240
Ice?

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.000
Did you just hit me?

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.800
Can’t you see how much I love you?

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:58.560
I even went public with us for you!

00:18:58.560 --> 00:18:59.800
Enough.

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.200
You did all that because you knew

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.440
that you had no one else left.

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:04.680
Ice.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:06.080
Ice!

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:06.960
Stop right there.

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.920
If you take one more step,

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.280
I swear I won’t let you off.

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:23.120
I’ll take it from here.

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.920
Take care of Saint, okay?

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:27.400
He’s never had this much to drink before.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.120
I’m not sure what’ll happen.

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:34.440
Yeah, I’ll handle it.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:44.680
Ice!

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:45.800
Ice!

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.400
Hey! Hey?

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:48.640
Ice!

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:50.760
Hey!

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.200
Walk carefully.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:04.040
We’re almost there.

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:05.000
Uncle!

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.680
Hey, salmon!

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.520
What salmon? These are just fish balls.

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:09.800
Uncle! Salmon!

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:11.160
Uncle, stop!

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:12.520
Don’t eat yet!

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:13.840
Are you selling them or eating them yourself?

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:14.880
Saint!

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.320
Don’t, uncle.

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:17.480
Put it down.

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.160
Let’s talk.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:18.800
Just for a minute.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:19.560
I want salmon.

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:20.360
I want salmon!

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:21.360
I want that salmon!

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:22.720
Please.

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.440
I’m a bear, so I gotta eat salmon, right?

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:25.480
Right?

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:29.680
Can I buy it from you?

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.360
Alright, 200 baht.

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:34.760
Two hundred?!

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.160
Let him have it.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:40.960
Come on.

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:42.800
Here.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.520
Here.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.320
Thank you.

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:51.240
Let’s go.

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:54.440
Fish balls are fine, I guess.

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:10.080
Here, I’ll do it for you.

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:15.960
Just sit still.

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.480
Want sauce?

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:31.040
Of course, who eats without sauce?

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.840
Here, eat up, bear.

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.520
Good?

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.960
Hey.

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:05.800
Saint!

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:09.520
Salmon!

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.040
Are you okay?

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.880
Mmm.

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.800
Sit down, sit down.

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:22.760
You okay?

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.160
Need help with anything?

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:28.720
Saint?

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.200
You still with me?

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:42.160
Play guitar for me.

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:42.640
Huh?

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:44.920
Play guitar for me.

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.480
I wanna hear you play.

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:50.800
What song?

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.080
A lullaby maybe?

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:57.480
Suits your state right now.

00:22:58.680 --> 00:22:59.600
No.

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.240
Play our song.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.800
Ours.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:15.880
Sure.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.880
(Thank you for coming into my life)

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.720
(as a ray of sunshine,)

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:30.000
(that gives meaning to a sunflower like me)

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.960
(from once withered to bloom again.)

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:39.640
(Thank you for making everyday)

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:42.880
(no longer lonely as it once was.)

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:47.120
(I'll give back with all the love in my heart.)

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:53.240
(Always Red Sunflower of yours.)

00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:58.720
That's great.

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:02.840
Ice.

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:03.880
Hmm?

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:06.160
I have something to tell you.

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:14.560
Actually, my dad forced Lanee and me

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:17.040
to be in a fake relationship

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.640
and pretend to love each other.

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.120
So that we could have our own lives.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.200
So that’s why you two had to kiss on the cheeks?

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.440
Whatever.

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.440
But you and Lanee…

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:41.040
you look good together.

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:44.520
But I don’t like Lanee.

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.520
There’s someone else I like.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:56.880
Who?

00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:58.640
Can you tell me?

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.480
Not now.

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:07.360
Then why make me curious?

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:12.440
One day,

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:15.040
I’ll tell you myself.

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.280
Saint, are you awake yet?

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:42.920
Saint.

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:49.280
Saint.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:00.920
Wake up.

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:20.400
Here.

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:26.120
Thanks.

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:29.600
Hey…

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.440
you’re still being a bear, huh?

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:36.320
I want salmon.

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:37.480
Want salmon.

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:38.560
Want salmon.

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:39.280
Want salmon.

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:40.000
Want salmon.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000
Were you possessed by a grizzly or something?

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:46.080
If I’m a grizzly bear,

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:46.600
then you’re…

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:47.880
a panda bear.

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:50.000
What?

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:53.520
Here.

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:00.000
Delete it.

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:01.960
You delete my photo first.

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:04.240
Saint,

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.280
I’m serious.

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:07.160
Just delete it.

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:10.360
Hey, I’m sorry.

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:13.960
I didn’t mean to make you feel bad.

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:19.000
I deleted it.

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:28.040
Thanks for getting my guitar back.

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:30.600
But don’t drink that much again.

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.680
You could die, you know.

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:39.320
If it wasn’t you,

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:42.120
I wouldn’t have drank that much.

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:45.240
Am I that important?

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:10.400
You still kept it?

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:12.960
I've never thought of throwing it away.

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:18.400
So it was your dad who broke it last time.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.880
Then I’ll fix it this time.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.680
And I got this for you, too.

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.960
I saw it and thought it was cute,

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:39.200
so I bought it for you.

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.000
Cute, right?

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:47.680
Just like you.

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:06.160
There, it’s on.

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:09.520
See? Told you I could fix it.

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:11.200
Pretty good, huh?

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:12.600
Yeah.

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:20.360
Now it’s just like before.

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:41.280
I’m glad the sunflower I drew is still there.

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.240
It’s always been there.

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:52.080
So…

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:54.200
if you don’t marry Lanee,

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:55.720
what will you do?

00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:58.840
I don’t know.

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.000
But...

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.960
I think it’s time.

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:06.960
I need to live my own life.

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:09.800
I just want to be an ordinary person

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:11.800
who gets to be with someone I like.

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:25.800
The bear is tilted.

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.880
You guys are here early.

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.960
How long are you going to avoid me?

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:56.760
Sea.

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:03.320
I have nothing to say to you.

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:04.960
Didn’t I already say

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.120
we should only talk about work?

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:10.360
Talking more and understanding each other

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:12.840
is part of working together, isn’t it?

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:16.160
You always tell actors to talk things out.

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:18.280
So why can’t the director do it too?

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:30.640
I only have three things to say to you.

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:33.200
Just listen till the end.

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:35.480
Whether you believe me

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:38.520
or not afterward is up to you.

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:49.680
First, Saint and I don’t love each other like that.

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:52.640
No matter what, we’ll never get married.

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:04.080
Second…

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:09.120
I already like someone else.

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:14.760
And the person I like is you.

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:19.680
I’ve liked you since the first day I saw you,

00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:23.560
since the moment we passed each other on campus.

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:29.040
I really liked you, and that feeling keeps growing.

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:40.320
This is the cake I cut just for you from my birthday.

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:46.560
Say the third thing,

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:48.640
so I can get back to work.

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:53.760
Okay.

00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:58.480
Can you please stay around a little longer to be

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:02.960
the reason and encourage me to face my mom?

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:06.080
Because if you’re not by my side,

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:09.640
I don’t even know why I’d keep trying.

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.600
Aren’t you going to say something?

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:20.320
If you act cold toward me even a little,

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:24.760
I’ll start crying.

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:37.680
It’s probably spoiled by now.

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:41.920
You shouldn’t have kept it that long.

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:44.760
I just wanted you to know…

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:46.880
that everything I’ve done,

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:52.000
I always did with you in mind.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.840
And I never wanted to talk to you just for fun.

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:12.120
Are you still mad at me?

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:19.080
Okay.

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:24.520
Then can I add a fourth thing?

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:30.000
I never wanted to kiss Warm.

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.400
Do you know why?

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:36.800
Because the only person I’ve ever wanted to kiss

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:38.800
is you.

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:46.880
Actually..

00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:51.560
I stopped being mad at you after the second thing.

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:55.360
Really?

00:34:55.639 --> 00:34:56.679
Yeah.

00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:01.320
Then why didn’t you say so back then?

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:05.120
Why wait until I got to the fourth thing?

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:06.760
Because I wanted to tell you back

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:10.560
that the only person I want to kiss...

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:13.680
is you too.

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:26.480
Let me see, are you crying?

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:30.000
Still beautiful.

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:32.320
Not anymore.

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:33.720
You are.

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:43.920
Welcome to our new member

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:45.920
joining as part of the friends’ group!

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:50.240
Thank you.

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:55.480
Today’s activity is about imagination.

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:58.520
We’ll start by imagining simple, everyday things

00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:00.400
and then move to things farther away.

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:01.760
Alright, let’s begin.

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.120
Imagine that

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:04.680
you feel hot.

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:05.760
Three.

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:06.480
Two.

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:07.440
One.

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:08.520
Action.

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:11.000
It’s hot! So hot!

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.320
Ugh, it’s boiling!

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:14.640
I can’t take it anymore!

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:15.880
Oh!

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:17.600
It's so hot!

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:19.240
I can’t take it anymore!

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:20.800
It’s so hot I’m sweating everywhere!

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:23.280
I can’t do this anymore!

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:25.120
Ok.

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:29.320
And the person who acted the most realistically

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:31.120
was…

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:33.560
Ten!

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.440
You’re confused, right?

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:41.200
Well, when people feel hot,

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:44.040
sometimes they just stand still.

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:47.040
Holy shit, that was amazing!

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:48.920
How did you do that, Ten?

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:51.640
Alright.

00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:54.080
Now let’s try imagining something farther from reality.

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:56.480
Let’s imagine that

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:57.800
the person in front of you

00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:59.640
is your boyfriend or girlfriend.

00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:03.360
Uh…

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:04.800
We’re not even in pairs.

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:07.040
Then you can play with Book.

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:08.680
I’ll sacrifice myself. Huh?

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:09.520
I'm so good now.

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:11.280
Wow.

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:12.400
Ok.

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:15.360
Come on.

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:17.280
Imagine that the

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:19.280
person sitting across from you is your lover.

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:21.720
How would you act, look,

00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:23.600
and what would the conversation be like?

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:24.680
Try.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.240
Hey.

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:32.960
What are you doing?

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:34.320
I miss you.

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:36.760
What kind of mood are you in?

00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:38.360
I just miss you.

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:40.800
Do I need a reason to?

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:45.880
Why are you being so clingy,

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:47.880
little bear?

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:53.200
Because I don’t want my big bear to disappear again.

00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:56.120
Are they seriously rehearsing?

00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:59.440
Why do I feel something heavy in the air?

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:00.320
Right?

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:03.120
They are more than friends for sure.

00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:04.160
Yeah.

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:06.360
Alright, let me try.

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:08.960
Wanna go on a date?

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:11.280
Hey, no, that’s not it!

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:12.400
Uh…

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:14.120
I think that’s too stiff.

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:15.240
It should be like…

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:17.200
Wanna go on a date, babe?

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:19.000
Why are you being so polite?

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:19.800
Lovers don’t talk like that!

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:21.080
Okay, cut!

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:22.040
Mud,

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:24.240
what happened there?

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:26.840
I just didn’t feel it.

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:27.840
Didn’t feel it?

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:31.880
Yeah, I just can’t imagine myself

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:33.280
being Book’s boyfriend.

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:37.480
That’s why it’s called imagination.

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:41.360
Maybe you should just act natural.

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:42.680
Like, don’t overdo it.

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:45.840
Sometimes being your normal self

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:47.720
would be like an actual lover.

00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:55.320
No.

00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:57.560
If I imagine that, it just feels…

00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.560
ridiculous.

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:10.320
If it’s that funny to play with me,

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:12.560
then play with Ten instead.

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:16.200
What’s wrong with you?

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:17.880
Ugh.

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:19.360
Can we even finish this scene?

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:20.360
My head hurts.

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:24.880
Oh,

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.680
by the way about Warm taking credits for your songs?

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:29.120
I already leaked the story.

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:38.640
(#TraineeWarmDrama: career dead before debut)

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:39.720
(Evidence shows he stole his ex’s song credit)

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:41.920
(Netizens reveal he also cheated)

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:42.800
(Netizen 2: Saw him flirting with girls at clubs,

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:43.520
(so messy!)

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:44.120
(So he had another girlfriend? I’m confused.)

00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:46.200
(Netizen 3: I waited for his debut, so disappointed.

00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:57.600
Hey, did we go too far?

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:02.560
He wasn’t fired just for stealing a song, right?

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:07.120
Like Book said,

00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:09.040
Warm screwed himself over with his own behavior.

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:10.920
You better not blame yourself.

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:12.160
Yeah.

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:22.720
Ugh, but Wednesday’s unlucky.

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:24.080
Saturday’s the best day to start new things

00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:25.760
and Sunday’s the most vibrant.

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:28.120
Everything will go smoothly.

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:28.880
Ha!

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:31.080
Whether it goes smoothly or not depends on who?

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:32.240
On me!

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:32.920
Besides,

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:33.800
shooting on holidays is a nightmare

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:35.760
because there's too many people.

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:36.480
You know that, right?

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:37.880
And you’re still worried about lucky timing?

00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:41.360
Well, if it rains or something happens,

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:42.720
don’t blame me!

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:43.200
Ugh.

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:44.160
Ah!

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:46.840
Why are you two arguing over the dumbest stuff?

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:48.400
And you too.

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:49.320
What? How’s this my fault?

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:52.280
Don’t say fortune-telling is silly!

00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:53.400
Then why don’t you

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:55.080
make a fortune-telling content video, Cookie?

00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:56.880
That way, we can use it to promote the show.

00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:58.960
Good idea!

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:02.720
Finally, I can prove my skills at work!

00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:08.640
Hello everyone,

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:13.560
welcome to our new Midnight Noon segment!

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:16.600
I’m Cookie, the resident fortune-teller.

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:18.320
accurate and honest, no lies!

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:20.000
Our first guest today!

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.880
Tada ~ Saint!

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:23.680
Hi.

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:27.840
What do you want me to read for you today?

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:32.240
Work, I guess.

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:34.800
Boring! No!

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:36.960
Let's do love instead!

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:40.280
Pick one card.

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:44.440
Here. Alright.

00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:52.080
The Sun.

00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:53.560
This means

00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:56.000
your love life is about to shine!

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.240
A relationship is developing beautifully.

00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:01.680
If you’re single and go for someone,

00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:05.280
they’ll start to notice your good qualities.

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:10.200
Come on, Ice.

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:11.520
Pick a card.

00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:14.240
Don’t be scared.

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:15.000
This one?

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:28.360
The Fool, the liar.

00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:30.360
This card says that

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:35.920
the one you love might be hiding a secret.

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:37.880
If they like someone else,

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:40.480
they’ll still act like they like you too,

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:44.040
making you confused and uncertain.

00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:51.920
But hey,

00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:55.280
destiny only decides 20%.

00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:58.440
The rest is up to us.

00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:00.680
That’s it for today, Cookie’s signing off!

00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:02.680
Bye-bye!

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:24.880
Hey, you can head back first.

00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:27.200
Pas asked Lanee and me

00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:28.960
to help with the songwriting contest.

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:30.000
Oh?

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:32.920
When will you be back?

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:35.720
Probably late.

00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:56.200
Okay.

00:44:57.680 --> 00:44:58.920
I have something to tell you.

00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:04.760
Come here.

00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:11.120
I have a crush.

00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:14.880
Huh?

00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:30.000
I mean,

00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:32.360
that’s the theme of the contest “love and crushes.”

00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:40.840
I'm all done.

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:45.520
That’s all I’ll spoil for now, see you later.

00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:53.000
Nice.

00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:56.280
Take care, Ice.

00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:57.240
Bye.

00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:02.640
That was awesome.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000
Alright, this is the last team’s performance.

00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:28.040
So what are you going to do about Ice?

00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:29.360
Are you going to just be with him?

00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:30.560
Or...

00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:33.320
should we both just hold our partners’ hands and say

00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:36.080
there’s no way we’re getting married?

00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:39.520
If it were that easy,

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:41.000
I would’ve done it a long time ago.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:42.880
I wouldn’t have let things end the way

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:44.400
they did in high school.

00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:46.840
If I go public with him now,

00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:48.400
my dad will just do everything

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:50.200
to make Ice disappear from my life anyway.

00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:54.080
So you’re just gonna let it stay this way forever?

00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:57.680
No.

00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:00.600
As soon as I can deal with my dad,

00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:02.400
I’ll tell Ice the whole truth.

00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:04.800
I just…

00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:09.440
don’t want anyone to hurt him again.

00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:30.800
Hello?

00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:31.720
Warm.

00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:34.120
I told you, if you’re still around,

00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:36.000
my company is going to take a hit.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.080
This news is huge, you know that?

00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:39.200
No.

00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:39.960
Please, I just want...

00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:41.120
I told you to be careful!

00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:42.360
You never listen!

00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:42.840
Hey.

00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:43.440
Hey.

00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:45.120
Shit.

00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:58.720
Tina.

00:47:58.720 --> 00:47:59.360
Tina!

00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:03.400
Hello?

00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:04.600
Tina, where are you?

00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:05.400
Hey!

00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:07.280
Stop calling me already.

00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:09.280
You copied a song and you still dare to call me?

00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:11.160
Tina.

00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:12.560
Tina, listen to me!

00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:13.480
Tina!

00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:16.000
Shit.

00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:24.200
Damn it.

00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:40.920
Ice.

00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:42.240
Sorry, the number you are trying to reach

00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:45.200
cannot be contacted at the moment.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:47.800
Ice.

00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:49.160
Sorry, the number you are trying to reach

00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:51.440
cannot be contacted at the moment.

00:48:58.280 --> 00:48:59.360
Fuck.

00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:01.960
You’re selfish too, Ice.

00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:30.520
Hey.

00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:31.440
What are you doing here?

00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:36.320
I came to see my boyfriend, of course.

00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:38.520
I missed you, can’t I come see you?

00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:41.760
I told you that day already.

00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:43.760
We broke up.

00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:45.280
Wait.

00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:46.640
Let’s talk.

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:52.240
I have nothing left to say to you.

00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:54.240
Okay, okay.

00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:55.400
I’ll get straight to it.

00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:59.880
I just realized that

00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:05.400
you never gave me something.

00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:07.640
What?

00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:09.640
I already returned everything you gave me.

00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:13.600
My headphones.

00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:16.240
Even though we broke up,

00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:18.480
I still want to..

00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:20.760
You don’t have to say anything, I’ll go get them.

00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:36.280
Do you want anything else?

00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:38.360
We’ve got grilled pork skewers too. No.

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:52.240
What would you like?

00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:54.760
Hold on a sec. Sure, take your time.

00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:07.880
(Saint: Have you eaten yet?)

00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:12.040
(Saint: Want anything? I’ll bring something up.)

00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:13.440
Um…

00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:16.360
How much for the grilled pork?

00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:17.960
Ten baht per skewer.

00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:20.480
I’ll take ten skewers.

00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:22.160
Would you like sticky rice too?

00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:23.880
Two packs, please. Sure.

00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:24.840
Sure.

00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:30.480
(Saint: Have you eaten yet?)

00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:32.600
(Saint: Want anything? I’ll bring something up.)

00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:35.600
One hundred twenty baht.

00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:37.040
Here you go, thank you.

00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:39.040
Thanks.

00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:49.720
Hey!

00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:51.680
What the hell are you doing?!

00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:53.720
What, I can’t?

00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:54.560
You asshole!

00:51:58.160 --> 00:51:59.920
What the hell are you doing?!

00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:00.680
Take it!

00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:04.960
I think I told you wrong earlier.

00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:10.520
I don’t want my headphones anymore.

00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:13.720
Then what do you want?

00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:14.200
Huh?

00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:16.800
Hey!

00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:18.040
Stay still.

00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:18.960
Warm!

00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:20.200
You bastard!

00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:29.840
You son of a bitch!

00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:31.760
Good.

00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:34.040
My whole life, I’ve never gotten anything before Saint.

00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:35.760
So now I’ll fuck you before Saint does.

00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:40.200
And I’ll record it too,

00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:42.680
in case anyone wants to see

00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:44.960
a washed-up ex-porn star

00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:47.080
fucking a failed trainee like me.

00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:51.080
Shit.

00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:00.760
I’ve been waiting for this for so long, Ice.

00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:02.560
You piece of shit.

00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:05.680
This drug will make you beg me for it.

00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:28.240
Come on, moan for me.

00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:36.120
Moan out loud!

00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:41.200
You fucker!

00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:42.720
You bastard! Hey, Ice!

00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:46.200
Ice! Shit!

00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:47.520
You fucker!

00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:57.000
Got drugged yourself, huh?

00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:58.160
How does it feel?

00:53:58.160 --> 00:53:59.360
Good?

00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:10.680
(Saint)

00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:11.560
Saint!

00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:15.000
Hello, Ice?

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:15.640
Saint!

00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:16.920
Ice.

00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:20.760
Saint!

00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:22.400
Hello, Ice!

00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:24.800
(Saint)

00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:26.840
Saint.

00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:28.760
Ice.

00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:31.680
Saint, help me.

00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:33.440
Ice? Hello?

00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:35.560
Saint, help me.

00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:36.360
Saint.

00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:40.960
Saint.

00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:49.840
Saint.

00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:57.040
No one’s coming to save you.

00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:02.280
Saint.

00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:03.720
Saint.

00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:07.360
Warm!!

00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:08.640
What the hell are you doing?!

00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:12.200
Ice!

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:16.920
Saint!

00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:19.040
Saint!

00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:27.840
Saint!

00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:30.760
Saint!

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.000
Calm down, man.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:34.720
Saint.

00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:38.280
Let me go.

00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:40.000
I didn’t do anything wrong.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:41.280
Take him away.

00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:49.680
Can this be used as evidence?

00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:50.640
Let me take a look.

00:55:57.480 --> 00:55:59.520
From the initial investigation,

00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:03.600
the suspect overdosed on drugs and mixed it with alcohol.

00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:06.320
Please take care of it.

00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:07.400
Yes, sir.

00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:09.200
I’ll proceed with the case.

00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:11.240
Excuse me. Goodbye.

00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:15.720
Ice.

00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:19.360
Ice.

00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:21.920
Meena.

00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:22.880
Yes, Saint?

00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:25.440
I think we should take Ice to the hospital right away.

00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:28.080
Okay, I’ll go get a car.

00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:30.280
Ice, are you okay, dear?

00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:34.320
Saint, please look after him.

00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:02.040
Drink some water.

00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:30.960
Are you feeling better?

00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:36.400
Come on, I’ll take you to the hospital.

00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:44.880
Can we not go?

00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:49.720
No.

00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:51.600
Get up.

00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:57.360
Saint, kiss me.

00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:03.360
No.

00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:05.840
Saint.

00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:12.160
Just once, please, kiss me.

00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:16.560
Come on, I’ll take you to the hospital.

00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:32.040
Ugh, why’s there so much traffic?

00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:33.720
And that car? Why don’t they just turn?

00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:34.640
Use the signal, ugh!

00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:36.520
We're in a hurry here!

00:59:36.520 --> 00:59:37.640
How’s he doing?

00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:40.480
Is Ice okay?

00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:42.920
I really don’t know.

00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:46.200
From now on, I promise, I won’t be careless again.

00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:49.360
I won’t let strangers enter the building easily ever again.

00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:51.000
I’m truly sorry.

00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:53.200
Ice,

00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:54.000
I’m sorry.

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:19.160
Take it slow.

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:33.720
Drink some water first.

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:50.600
Are you feeling a bit better now?

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:53.120
Yeah.

01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:57.320
Just a little dizzy, that’s all.

01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:59.480
But I’m okay otherwise.

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:03.920
Aren’t you going to change clothes?

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:08.080
No.

01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:11.120
I wanted to stay until you woke up.

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:15.720
I never thought

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:18.200
Warm would do something like that to me.

01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:21.520
Because he’s a bastard.

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:25.000
But don’t worry, the cops already arrested him.

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:29.320
After this, your karma with him is done.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.200
I’m sorry

01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:38.480
for letting you go through something dangerous again.

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:44.600
It’s okay.

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:46.080
It’s not your fault.

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:52.600
Even though I said I wanted to protect you,

01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:55.760
in the end, I was never in time.

01:01:57.040 --> 01:02:00.720
How could anyone have known this would happen?

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:02.360
If you had known beforehand,

01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:05.240
would you have let me be in danger like that?

01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:11.120
About last night, being drugged and all

01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:12.280
if it weren’t for you,

01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:14.360
things could’ve been so much worse.

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:21.240
Thank you so much.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.400
Even though I like protecting you,

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:30.160
I still want you to only go through good things.

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:31.600
Yeah.

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:20.880
Or maybe Saint and Book like each other.

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:22.880
Wait.. do you like Book?

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.200
Why am I annoyed?

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:31.800
They’re even wearing matching shirts.

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:34.480
Oh?!

01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:37.200
I’m mad now.

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:38.400
Happy now?

01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:43.080
Wait, are you jealous?
