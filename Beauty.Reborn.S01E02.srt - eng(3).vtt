00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.120
{\an8}Hello. I'm Sara.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.160
{\an8}Please call me Sarah.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.680
{\an8}Pathawee Phimarndech?

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.040
{\an8}Is that you, Din?

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.080
{\an8}Someone's so cautious now.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.159
{\an8}She probably thinks I brought her here
to do something inappropriate.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.040
{\an8}Does the company have financial problems?

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.400
{\an8}It's your first day here.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.400
{\an8}Don't you think
that's an inappropriate question?

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.880
{\an8}Hey. Are you okay?

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.640
{\an8}I'm claustrophobic.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.480
{\an8}Hey!

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.200
{\an8}I'm Apo Phimarndech,
but you can call me Nam.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.040
{\an8}Nice to meet you.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.960
{\an8}Cut it out.
Who'd ever date such an ugly girl?

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.080
{\an8}Let me give you a little warning.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.000
{\an8}That woman just started today.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.600
{\an8}Don't get handsy with her.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.960
{\an8}I wasn't. Just flirting.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.920
{\an8}You've been a show-off
since you were a kid, huh, Din?

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.480
{\an8}Dad, hands together like this.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.600
{\an8}Yeah. Then stretch them out.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.240
{\an8}Alright, count.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.560
{\an8}Ten, 11,

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.560
{\an8}12, 13, 14,

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.960
{\an8}15!

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.480
{\an8}Dad, I'd like to move
to an apartment near the office.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.680
{\an8}We already have a house.
Why waste money renting another place?

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.160
{\an8}Our house is too far.
I can't afford to pay for taxis every day.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.840
{\an8}When I think about it,
that actually costs more than rent.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.400
Sweetheart, if you're planning to move out

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.480
so you can work overtime
and earn more money

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.640
for my surgery,

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.120
you don't have to.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.480
Dad, the salary here's really good.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.639
Even without overtime,
I'll still have plenty left to help you.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.560
That good?
I still don't even know where you work.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.400
You wouldn't know it. It's just…

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.960
a small company that's growing fast,

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.720
so they offered me a high salary.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.960
Anyway…

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.920
I've got to go to the uni.
I'll be late for my presentation.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.240
I'm leaving.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.560
And sis, make sure
Dad keeps up his exercises, okay?

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.680
Got it.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.400
-I'm leaving, Dad.
-Good luck, son.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.000
Okay, next move.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.280
Hold on.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.240
Don't explain like it your brother does.
My ears hurt.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.600
Dad.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.520
Why does he hate
the Phimarndech family so much?

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.520
Did something happen
while I was studying abroad?

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.960
He doesn't hate the whole family.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.280
Just one person.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.960
Yo, the youngest son of Tesho.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.160
Uncle Suthee,
can you unload the stuff from the car?

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.400
Sure thing.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.600
You like bossing around, huh?

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.960
My dad's not your servant.
Don't act like he is.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.600
I can just call the housekeeper, then.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.480
Aunt Soi? Aunt Soi, are you around?

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.560
It's fine. I'll do it myself.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.120
Dad.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.480
-I'll leave it to you.
-Yes.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.240
Hey, calm down.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.720
Why'd you stop me, Dad?

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.880
If we don't show them
we're not their servants,

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.760
they'll just keep treating us like one.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:05.880
Come on.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.920
Carrying boxes is no big deal.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.160
Even though Tesho is gone,

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.960
we still owe him a great debt.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.040
If he hadn't helped when I was struggling,

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.079
who would've taken care
of your mom and sister?

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.800
Money debts can be repaid,

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.520
but a debt of gratitude
lasts a lifetime, huh?

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.320
Here.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.400
Those two don't just have problems
at the Phimarndech house.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.600
They've been fighting elsewhere too.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.760
Where?

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.160
At university.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.040
Small world, huh?
They ended up at the same school.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.200
And I heard they're even
in the same group for a presentation.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.360
Who knows if they'll start another fight.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.160
I already sent the content.
Why didn't you put it in the slides?

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.680
You sent it at six in the morning.
What do you expect us to do with that?

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.880
We couldn't reach you all night.
We had to write the content ourselves.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.520
Things come up sometimes, you know.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.200
Guys, come on.
Let's just use this time to rehearse.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.840
I said, put my content in the slides

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.720
or I'm not presenting.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.680
Fine, we'll change only your part, Yo.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.960
Come on. We're a team, right? Change it.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.680
No way.
We've done enough because of him already.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.800
If he can't do it,
let the professor deduct his points.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.160
So, that's it?

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.280
You're mad because I once asked your dad,

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.600
the gardener, to help out?

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.800
You're taking it out on me?

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.040
-Yo!
-Hey.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.320
I've been holding back long enough!

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.960
Hey! Stop fighting,
or we'll all fail the group project.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.360
Yo, come with me.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.160
Come here, Yo.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.560
We need to talk.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.040
Come on, Yo.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.680
Come. Let's sort this out.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.600
You have to go apologize to Sarach.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.920
We're about to present.
Don't start drama now.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.200
He's been annoying since we were kids.
Always pushing my buttons.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.640
Everyone else knows
you're the one who's annoying.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.880
Who the hell sends slides at six
after disappearing all night?

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.000
I had things to do.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.080
Playing games doesn't count
as "things to do".

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.640
Don't think I don't know.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.280
If it were me,
I'd have done exactly what they did.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.080
You're not being very nice.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.760
Well, always taking his side.
You like him or something?

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.320
Nina, are you in your room?

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.160
Hello, ma'am.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.680
Did you need something?

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.800
I'll wait for you downstairs.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.840
I should get going.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.680
See you.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.120
Don't let him come here again.
I don't like him.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.640
Oh, Mom, come on.
I don't even have a boyfriend.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.040
Let me live a little.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.320
What about Nam, then?

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.320
Not interested anymore?

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:59.080
If he were committed to me,
I'd be ready to give everything up.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.840
Be careful,
or you'll lose Nam to someone else.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.440
Who?

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.400
Eating alone? Don't you get lonely?

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:28.240
Not at all. The food's so good, it makes
me forget what loneliness feels like.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:31.480
But it'd taste even better
if you had it with me

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.200
because I've got…

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.520
this! My secret weapon.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.600
Chili fish sauce? Should I be impressed?

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.840
Hey, it's the specialty here!

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:45.360
No idea what they put in it,
but it's incredible.

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.360
It lives up to the hype.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.640
Though it probably tastes even better
with someone special.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.000
What are you doing here, Nina?

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:15.400
I came to see Din,
running an errand for my parents.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:21.160
I'm so glad to see you. I've missed you.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.400
By the way,

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.880
I've never seen
this beautiful lady before. New employee?

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.600
Are you asking me?

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:41.040
Of course. You're the only beautiful one
in this whole cafeteria.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:47.600
I just started here a few days ago.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.080
Which department?

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.640
Cosmetic science.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.720
You must be really smart.
Someone like me could never do that.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.800
I'm impressed.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.600
Here you go.

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.760
Thank you.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.760
I'd like to apologize for Nina.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.320
For what?

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.800
For barging in like that.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:49.160
We're… old friends.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:53.720
We've known each other so long,
we sometimes forget our manners.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:58.560
I figured you might not be used to that,
so I wanted to say sorry.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.480
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.040
Tomorrow's Saturday.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.280
Wanna go out somewhere?

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.920
I'm helping my dad at our farmhouse.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.200
No time for fun.

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:25.920
A farmhouse?

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.760
Sounds interesting. Mind if I tag along?

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:34.120
It's not fun, trust me. It's exhausting.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.400
I might find it fun.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.240
Suit yourself.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:04.400
About the interest payment extension,
my father's okay with it.

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:09.400
Thank you.
I'll take care of it as soon as I can.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.560
Okay. I'm going
to the movies with Nam tonight.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.600
You've already met Nam?

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:20.560
Yes, he was with a pretty new employee.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.520
Din?

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:34.200
I was just thinking maybe
I should fire everyone in this company.

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:35.800
It'd keep our secrets safe.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.760
Otherwise, any new hire

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.160
can never escape your eyes and ears.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.560
If you want to keep a secret,
you'd better talk to your mother first.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:49.560
Because if she doesn't approve,
no one here would dare say a word.

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.640
By the way,

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:59.000
why is there never sugar
with the coffee here?

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.480
You know I like things sweet.

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.720
Don't you ever try to please me?

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:18.160
I'll take care of it, Nina.

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:23.080
Next time,
there'll be sugar served with your coffee.

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.080
Thank you so much.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.480
I just want everything to go smoothly,

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.480
including your company.

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.440
Don't worry, Dad.

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.480
I'll take care of the company.

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.640
And as for Nam and Yo,

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:21.040
I won't let either of them struggle.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:23.760
I'm sorry…

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:30.560
you had to carry this burden for me.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.000
I'm sorry…

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.280
‎I…

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.240
No matter how heavy it gets,

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.920
I'll never give up, Dad.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.160
Who's up so early?

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.560
It's Mr. Nam.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:13.960
Damn it!

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.520
Haven't seen you this mad in ages.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.200
How'd Nam even leave the house this early?
He usually wakes up in the afternoon.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:26.920
I don't think he's slept yet.

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:31.240
I saw him while I was out jogging.
He was eating breakfast, chugging coffee,

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:35.120
and downing an energy drink too.
He's probably buzzing like crazy by now.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.880
And why didn't you tell me then?

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:40.000
You didn't tell me to.

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:43.040
How was I supposed to know
you wanted me to keep an eye on him?

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:47.840
I'm gonna grab breakfast.

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:02.480
These flowers are beautiful.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:09.600
Hey!

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.120
Who said you could pick them?

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.280
It's just one flower.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.680
Even one is not allowed. They're for sale.

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:22.600
So stingy. I'll buy them all then.

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:26.880
Showing off won't make me swoon, you know.

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:29.480
And it's not that impressive either.

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:33.800
Let's go. There's more to see.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:45.040
You're cute even when you scold me.

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:53.440
Can these flowers handle the sun?
It's boiling hot in Thailand.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.200
Salvias love sunlight.

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:59.520
They need at least
six to eight hours a day,

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:03.680
with an ideal temperature
between 20 and 35 degrees.

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:10.079
Don't pick any more.

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:12.560
I know.

00:17:17.599 --> 00:17:19.400
Come on. Let's keep going.

00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:29.040
Oh, thank you.

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.840
Are you tired?
You've been following me around all day.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.040
Not at all.

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:41.400
It's nice being surrounded by nature
once in a while

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.400
with such a peaceful atmosphere.

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:45.760
Feels like I've recharged.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.800
My dad and I take care
of this garden with love.

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:55.360
We want everyone who visits
to feel the same peace we do,

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.960
including the people who buy our flowers.

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:00.720
A garden this beautiful

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.360
must've been really well cared for.

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.080
It says a lot about its owner.

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.720
Beautiful, just like you.

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.240
Let's play dolls!

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:20.960
Dolls? Ugh, so annoying.

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:22.600
Who'd even want to play with you?

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.960
If I hadn't taken care of myself
and glowed up,

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.400
you'd never even look my way.

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:35.640
Wait, why are you mad?

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:36.920
I was complimenting you.

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:39.320
Taking care of yourself is a good thing.

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:44.200
Never mind. I'm hungry.

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:46.960
Let's grab something to eat.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:07.680
This fried mushroom chili dip is amazing!
I've never had anything like it.

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:12.440
Such a smooth talker.
You probably say that to everyone.

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:15.080
Only to you.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.440
"You" as in which "you"?

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:23.360
Din?

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.600
Hey, Din.

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:37.880
I snuck out and you still found me?
How'd you even know?

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.480
Let's just say I know.

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:44.560
But you shouldn't be out here
flirting around like this.

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.680
Nina's starting to put pressure on us.

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:50.360
If Mom gets back from France and finds
out, she won't take it well either.

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:52.520
We've been through this so many times.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.880
Why do I have to live my life
by everyone else's expectations?

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:57.880
This is my life.

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:00.000
I have the right to choose who I love.

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:01.440
And does she love you back?

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:04.640
You've barely met Sarah a few times.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.240
That's not love.

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.480
That's between me and her. Stay out of it.

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:12.960
You've never had to carry
the weight of someone else's life.

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:15.560
You don't know what sacrifice means.

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:16.560
Do you know--

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:23.880
Hello?

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:27.440
Oh, the beta test review file's
having issues?

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.520
I'm outside right now,

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.200
but I've got my laptop with me.
I'll send it over right away.

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:35.840
Yes.

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.880
You need to stay away from my brother.

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:58.920
If you've got eyes, you can clearly see
I haven't been pestering him at all.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.280
He's the one following me.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:05.120
You could've stopped him. Learn to say no.

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:12.480
I heard the office gossip.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:16.440
You're planning to marry
your brother off to Ms. Nina

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:18.240
to save your company.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.520
But since your brother doesn't like her,

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.560
you're trying to pressure me instead,
aren't you?

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:29.560
You know all that.
Did you bug my phone or something?

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.560
I can read you from across the galaxy.

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:35.080
Impressive.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:41.960
I know you're being sarcastic, but thanks.

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:47.600
If you know that much,
then stop messing with my brother.

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:49.480
I can't.

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.240
That's an order.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:56.080
Even if you're my boss, you can't
boss me around about my personal life.

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:57.840
Hey.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:21:59.880
Seriously, tell me.

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:02.200
Do you like him that much?
You really can't stop?

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.200
-No.
-Then why?

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:08.640
Things like this take teamwork.

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:11.480
Say I tell Mr. Apo

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:13.640
I'm not interested and to leave me alone,

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:16.560
what if he doesn't listen?
What am I supposed to do?

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:21.960
And even if he does,
it doesn't mean he'll fall for Ms. Nina,

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:23.400
right?

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:37.840
Hey.

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:41.320
Then tell me what I should do.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:44.440
Spend less time playing matchmaker

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:46.760
and more time getting financial advice.

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:48.920
Wait.

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:50.760
Whoa, watch it!

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:09.840
Din.

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:32.560
You like Ms. Sarah?
Is that why you're acting like this?

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.240
Like what?

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:40.040
You keep taking her away from me.

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:43.520
Taking her to the countryside,
sneaking off alone with her.

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:47.720
I'm her boss. Taking an employee
to see work sites, what's wrong with that?

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.280
And you,

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:53.160
stop acting like the relationship police.

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:57.360
I don't care. This one I really like.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.400
Since the first time I saw her.

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:02.720
Even if she hasn't shown any sign back,

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:05.560
mark my words.

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:09.320
I'm not backing down.

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:11.640
Not ever.

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:16.160
Even if it means
our family business goes under, Nam?

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:18.280
Mom.

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.480
Hello.

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.200
When did you get back?

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:33.360
We'll talk about that later. But for now…

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:36.440
Din, we need to talk.

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:50.080
This is our hometown's
best tom yum noodles!

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:55.400
And today, I'm going to mix them
with ice cream.

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:57.600
Okay, let's add it in.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.680
Here we go. Can everyone see this?

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:08.920
"Not weird enough. Next time, go crazier."

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:13.120
You'll have to donate first.
If we hit 10,000,

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:14.840
I'll come up with a new dish for you guys.

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:17.480
Alright, let's try it.

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:27.560
It's actually really good!

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:33.840
Someone just showed up. Next time,
I'll take you to try something else.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:35.800
Get your donations ready.

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:39.240
I'll use them to buy a new in-game skin.
It's super cute!

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:41.720
See you next time.

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.160
You look happy.

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:54.840
My crypto chart just shot up,

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:56.440
so I can't stop smiling.

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:03.040
Baicha.

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:07.240
If you're going out
with those Phimarndech boys,

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:08.960
be careful.

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:12.920
You know they're Dad's enemies.

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:17.240
The fights of the older generation
should stay with the older generation.

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:21.080
Both their dad and ours have been gone
a long time. Why keep hating each other?

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.840
I'll never stop hating them

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:26.880
until we take back
the company they stole from us

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.080
or their family falls apart.

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:42.760
If I ask you
to stop hating them, would you?

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:53.240
You can go.

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:22.480
I had to come back from France

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:24.920
because Mr. Praphop
and Ms. Rosarin called.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.400
They've put the investment

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:29.320
for the project we presented on hold

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:33.560
until Nina and Nam's marriage
shows progress.

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:37.240
How do we fix that?

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.160
Fire that girl.

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.560
Name her severance figure and do it.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:54.800
Mom, look at this.

00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:58.320
This is production data for every
cosmetic manufacturer in Thailand.

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:02.480
She could've sold it to me,
but she gave it away for free.

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.200
Didn't even ask for money.

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:08.520
Where else would you find someone
that generous and dedicated?

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:12.640
Listen to me.

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:15.040
Nothing in this world is free.

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:17.320
You think she's not getting
anything out of this?

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:21.720
Anyway.

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:24.000
If you won't fire that girl,

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:29.000
then make sure Nam breaks up with her
and marries Nina as soon as possible.

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:46.160
{\an8}-Wait.
-Ah!

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:47.520
{\an8}-Whoa, watch out!
-Ah!

00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:57.680
Ugh.

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:02.520
Stop it right now.
What are you even thinking?

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.920
You're back?

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.080
Have you eaten yet?

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:24.160
Hey, what's wrong?
Why aren't you answering me?

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:28.480
Why did you lie to me?

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:32.840
Lie about what?

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:35.400
About working at PD.

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.160
Hello?

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:51.200
Hello. I'm calling from PD Company.

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:55.720
There's something urgent I need to discuss
with Ms. Sara. Is she available?

00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:58.560
PD?

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:05.880
No wonder he found me.

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:07.360
Don't change the subject.

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.480
Say what you want to say.

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:17.480
I don't get you. We've had to live off
their so-called kindness for so long.

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:20.720
Why would you go work for them again?

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:24.280
How long are we gonna stay
indebted to that family?

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:31.080
I get how you feel.

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:34.400
But right now, we need the money.

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:37.520
And this job pays really well.

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:40.920
I didn't have a choice, Sarach.

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:43.840
Yeah, I know.

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:48.000
It's just frustrating. No matter what,
we can never get away from that family.

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:52.120
Sarach.

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:08.560
Sure, I'll pick you up.

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:11.360
Wait a sec. I'm heading out now.

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:18.200
Wait a minute.

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:21.840
Sarach.

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:24.160
Yeah?

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:28.240
Could you grab my car keys
from the living room? I'm going out.

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:32.200
Why can't you get them yourself?
You've got legs, don't you?

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:36.800
Ever heard of the word "kindness"?
Can't you see I'm on the phone?

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:39.000
You were already on the phone
when you walked out here.

00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:40.240
-Just go back--
-I'll wait here.

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:41.560
Thanks.

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:46.120
Hello, babe? See you in 20 minutes.

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.360
Dress up for me, yeah?

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:55.480
How long do we have
to keep living like this?

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:02.880
Not hanging out with your friends today?

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:05.640
Nah, too lazy.

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:08.480
Yo.

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:10.280
Mom!

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:15.320
Oh, I missed you so much. Give me a hug.

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:21.120
How was France?

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:22.400
It was lovely, dear.

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:25.080
Did you get me anything?

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.200
Oh, I thought you missed me.

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:29.440
Turns out you only missed the souvenirs.

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:34.240
But yes, there's your favorite chocolate.
It's in the fridge.

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:36.000
Yay!

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:37.760
You're the best, Mom. Thank you.

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:38.680
Alright.

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:41.600
-Come on, Mom. Let's eat.
-Let's go.

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:45.200
This chocolate's so good.
Your favorite kind.

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:47.160
Thank you.

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:55.240
If I didn't have to rush back
because of Mr. Praphop and Ms. Rosarin,

00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:58.280
I would've had time
to buy a lot more gifts.

00:32:58.360 --> 00:32:59.640
Right, Nam?

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:06.280
You should take Nina out sometime,
for shopping or even dinner.

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:07.560
Don't forget that our family

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:10.240
still depends on her father's support.

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:14.000
I'm already late. Gotta run.

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:23.880
Love you, Mom. Bye.

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:32.680
You see how unconcerned your brother is?

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:35.520
Yes.

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.880
So, make sure
you take care of this matter properly.

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:55.000
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:27.120
-That took forever.
-Yeah.

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:32.920
But it was worth it.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.560
The place looks nice.

00:34:35.639 --> 00:34:38.239
And being closer to the company
isn't a bad thing.

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:40.400
You don't have to wake up early anymore.

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:43.760
I hope so.

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:47.639
By the way, what's this I heard

00:34:47.719 --> 00:34:49.760
about Mr. Apo chasing after you?

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:51.560
How come?

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:56.560
How did you know about that?

00:34:56.639 --> 00:34:59.440
Please. Everyone knows.

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:01.840
Normally, he never shows up at the office.

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:05.880
But lately, he's been there every day.

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:09.160
People are gossiping nonstop.

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:13.200
And since our companies are connected,

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:16.720
word travels fast.

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:18.920
It's…

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:23.360
It's nothing.
He's just infatuated, that's all.

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.960
If I still looked like I did back then,

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:29.480
he'd treat me the same way
he did when we were kids.

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:32.800
Then I guess
we should thank that accident.

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:36.960
It made you gorgeous,
like you were reborn.

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:41.520
Wow, that's harsh. "Like I was reborn"?

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:43.120
Yeah.

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:48.840
I'm hungry. Let's grab something to eat.

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:50.360
Good idea.

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:54.160
Hi, Ms. Sarah.

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:56.200
Oh, Mr. Apo.

00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:00.360
I heard you moved into a new place, so…

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:01.880
I brought you this to say congrats.

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:05.480
Thank you.

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:10.040
It's a shame I'm busy today.
Otherwise, I'd have helped you unpack.

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:11.840
Oh, I wouldn't want to bother you.

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:14.320
I don't have that much stuff anyway.

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:17.240
Besides,
I already have someone helping me.

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:22.560
Well…

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:27.280
Toy, this is Mr. Apo, my boss.

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:31.080
I'm Toy, her ex-boyfriend.

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.640
Our relationship is…

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:36.520
kind of complicated. Hard to explain.

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:43.400
Nice to meet you.

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:56.880
-Well, I'm starving.
-Yeah, yeah.

00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:00.160
Why don't we go grab something to eat

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:01.400
and talk there?

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:04.520
Sure. What do you feel like?

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:08.160
Italian? Japanese?
I know tons of good places.

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:14.600
Sara's never been into bland, cheesy food.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.240
How about fermented crab?

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:26.200
Sounds good. I want something spicy.

00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:28.000
Maybe som tam with noodles?

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:33.920
You okay with that, Mr. Apo?

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.640
This place is our favorite spot.

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:40.840
The fermented crab papaya salad here

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:42.560
is fire.

00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:46.520
Well… I'm fine with anything.

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:49.280
Okay, what should I order for you?
I'll write it down.

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:55.000
Regular papaya salad.
Not too spicy, please.

00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:55.920
Not too spicy?

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:03.040
Fancy people's taste buds

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:05.600
can't really handle something.…

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:07.520
spicy, huh?

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:09.720
That's fine.

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:12.520
We'll just order his mild

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:13.880
and ours with ten chilies.

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:15.280
-Perfect.
-Alright then.

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:18.040
You can order whatever you like, Ms. Sara.

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:21.480
I'll have ten chilies too.

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:24.720
Or mash the chilies first,
then add the papaya.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.040
You sure about that?

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:30.280
Positive.

00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:37.640
Eat it all! You won't find flavor
like this anywhere else.

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:39.760
This place is one of a kind.

00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:06.000
You okay? Too spicy?

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:09.000
No, no.
I just swallowed wrong, that's all.

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:11.440
Alright then.

00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:13.280
‎-Wow.
‎-Fabulous!

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:17.000
It's so good!

00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:20.640
I swear, the auntie who makes this
must've sold her soul to the devil

00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:23.320
for flavor that perfect,
right to this sissy's core!

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:24.440
Super-spicy…

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:26.240
Right, bro?

00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:28.680
So…

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:30.320
Mr. Toy is…

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:31.480
Well…

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:34.480
LGBTQ.

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:36.320
Oh my.

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:39.160
Blame the auntie's magic hands!

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:41.680
They made me reveal my true self!

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:44.280
Never mind that. Come on, eat.

00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:46.800
Let's eat.

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:51.520
No matter how many years go by,
her cooking is still incredible.

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:57.080
Thank you so much
for taking me and Toy out for the meal,

00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:00.120
even though you barely touched your food.

00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:04.240
That's alright.
I wasn't that hungry anyway.

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:07.440
Seeing you and Mr. Toy enjoy it that much,
that's enough for me.

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:11.800
About Toy,

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:14.880
don't mind him teasing you, okay?

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:17.960
At first, I was going to mind.

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:22.520
But when I found out
he's actually your close friend,

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:24.200
not your ex,

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:26.440
I felt a lot better.

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:29.920
Right.

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:34.960
I'll be honest with you.

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:40.840
I like you, Ms. Sarah.

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:15.360
{\an8}I'm worried because

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:16.400
{\an8}I like you, Sarach.

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:20.760
{\an8}You never told me
why you wanted me to come along today.

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:24.880
{\an8}I heard their new R&D hire is really good.

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:26.800
{\an8}So, I wanted to meet her myself.

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:28.440
{\an8}You really think I'm that stupid?

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:31.240
{\an8}Just admit it. You like her!

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:34.080
{\an8}Yeah. I like Ms. Sarah.

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:24.880
