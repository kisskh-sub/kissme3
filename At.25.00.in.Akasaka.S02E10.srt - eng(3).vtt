"At 25:00, in Akasaka" Season 2
(Episode 10)

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.000
Ah, excuse me.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.750
Have you seen Mitarai?

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.460
No, forget that. Look at this.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.130
What?

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.790
The post office was robbed again.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:26.670
That's terrifying...

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.540
Never mind that, have you seen Mitarai?

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:29.920
I can't find him anywhere.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.920
- Just leave him be.
- Where on earth did he go?

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.420
Ah, there he is...

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.670
- That's my line.
- Good work.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:37.750
Hey, Muroga.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:38.880
What is it?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.790
I got a nice bottle of booze. Want to have a drink?

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.580
You're just planning to crash
at my place again, aren't you?

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.750
Is this even the right place?

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.170
Hey, the call isn't going through.
What's going on?

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.000
Is no one here?

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.500
Aren't you going to see Mitarai today?

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.000
What the hell? This place is in the middle of nowhere.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.670
I'll go in a bit.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.000
Hello, are you from the guesthouse?

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.880
No, I'm not.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.710
I'm the head of this village. My name is Goto.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.960
Village Head, hello. I'm Fukuyama.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.250
I loathed him.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.710
I envied him.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.540
I even wanted to kill him.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.420
No, that's not what I thought.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.670
You're not gentle at all.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.460
You're actually a cunning,
cold, and despicable man.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.670
That's why you killed Muroga
and took his place, isn't it?

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.040
You too?

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.670
Are you also here to get in my way?

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.500
Nakamura Yusaku.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.960
That's my real name.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.880
Until now, I've blamed others
for everything I've done.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.460
But that's not true.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.460
Everything was my own fault.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.880
He said, "You'll never amount to anything."

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.710
Those words have haunted me ever since.

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.250
Waiting for the moment I'd fall into hell.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.750
That's right. I'm just an imposter.

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.380
No matter who I replaced,
no matter how many times I killed...

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.130
I could only ever be myself.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.040
These hands, struggling for an ideal...

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.790
They grasp at nothing but emptiness.

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.170
All that's left is...

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.420
the feeling of tainted blood.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.380
And the deeply seared memory of my sins.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.420
I hate...

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.630
this life of being unloved by anyone,
of constantly running away.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.500
Mitarai...

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.500
If somewhere out there,
there exists a different world...

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.920
I hope we could have been good friends there.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.830
Your real name...

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:23.670
Is it Nakamura Yusaku?

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.380
It's a good name.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.290
Why...?

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.920
I'm sorry.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.670
I followed you.

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.290
I understand everything now.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.210
Why you came here, and the truth behind the incident.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.330
And why you haven't been yourself lately.
I understand it all.

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:03.210
The man you liked... the one named Muroga...

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.750
He doesn't exist in this world.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.630
No, you're right here.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.920
I'm not here at all.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.000
Yes, you are.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.170
You've always been here, haven't you?

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:34.330
No matter who you are,

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.920
you're still my good friend.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.960
No, that's not what I thought.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.330
No.

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.290
I don't want to lose to Asami-san.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.210
We've become true rivals, haven't we?

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:12.750
Yes.

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:14.960
I dropped out.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.000
I... was chosen.

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:19.920
Congratulations.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:23.630
If this keeps up, he might steal the role from me.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.830
I really like your acting.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.540
Who are you acting for?

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.960
Good work, you two.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:08.080
Sakuma, your performance as a scumbag was incredible today.

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:09.460
A scumbag?

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:11.420
- It was intense.
- Hey, that's no way to put it.

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:12.750
It's just acting.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:13.960
I know that.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.630
I meant it was a great performance.

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:18.170
Wait, do you really think so?

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:19.880
- I do.
- Really?

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.500
- It doesn't look like it.
- I do!

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:24.250
Yamase... You don't really mean that.

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:25.210
- I do!
- Really?

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.210
Haven't I been saying that this whole time?

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:28.750
Anyway, uh...

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.210
There's no show tomorrow.
Want to go for a couple of drinks?

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:33.540
Oh, I'm in.

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:35.380
Tomorrow's Shirasaki's birthday, right?

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:36.580
Let's celebrate.

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:38.960
Ah, well...

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.130
But today's a little...

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:45.330
Sakuma, let's just the two of us go today.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:45.960
Huh?

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.960
It seems Yuki has plans.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.380
- Oh, I see.
- How about it?

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.710
Well, let's celebrate some other time then.

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:54.040
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:55.920
See you some other time then.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.130
I'm heading out. You two have fun.

00:09:58.250 --> 00:09:59.170
Good work.

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:00.750
You too.

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:04.000
Sakuma, wait up.

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:05.080
Too close.

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:06.960
Let's go drinking.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.500
Okay.

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:21.580
Um, Shirasaki...

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.960
I'm really sorry about yesterday.

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:38.210
The one who should have made the decision
was you, Asami-san.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.330
And yet, I...

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:45.580
Me too.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.500
I'm sorry.

00:10:56.130 --> 00:11:01.460
At the audition,
when I saw you play Muroga...

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.420
I thought to myself...

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:12.130
that perhaps you were better suited to play him.

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:16.250
Although...

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:19.960
I could have chosen to stay in the audition until the end.

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.130
But I didn't.

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:27.920
Back then...

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:32.460
I couldn't do it.

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:44.420
In the play today...

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:52.040
your portrayal of Muroga was truly wonderful.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:10.880
Actually...

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.960
I've always loved your acting, Asami-san.

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:31.210
That's why I want you, Asami-san...

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:37.380
to do what you truly want to do.

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:47.920
Today...

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:53.670
after watching your performance, Shirasaki...

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.170
as an actor...

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.580
I don't want to lose to you.

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:12.460
I'll take it. That movie.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.460
Then, I'm going to England.

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:27.830
Yeah.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.380
Yeah.

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:43.080
Whoa, what is this place? It's incredible.

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:48.130
I feel like a celebrity.

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:55.580
When did you book this place?

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:59.540
Hmm... a long time ago.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.630
I had no idea.

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:05.210
Well, it was meant to be a surprise.

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:09.920
Then, when you're done filming, Asami-san...

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.920
I'll be the one to surprise you.

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.290
Huh?

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.540
You're going to surprise me?

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:19.130
That's right. You'd better look forward to it.

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:20.920
I will.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:23.210
Yeah.

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:25.960
What should I prepare?

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.670
Let me think...

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:30.210
How about something like this?

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:32.210
But that would be repetitive.

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:34.830
Or maybe the two of us could...

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:47.210
Thank you.

00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:58.040
Thank you for coming into my life.

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:09.790
That's my line.

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:20.630
What was that?

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:00.920
The smell of the ocean.

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.630
Yeah.

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:04.380
Somehow...

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:07.460
it reminds me a little of the sea back home.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
England...

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:22.960
It's so far away.

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.330
Yeah.

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:35.210
We're... going to be apart for a while.

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:39.630
Yeah.

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:44.710
Asami-san.

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:48.750
If anything sad happens while you're there...

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.580
please tell me anytime.

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:56.880
You've always been the one helping me, Asami-san.

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:00.630
This time, it's my turn to support you.

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:06.710
Though I don't know if I can do it
as well as you do.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.460
Thank you.

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:30.920
Here.

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:35.040
A birthday present.

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:44.960
Happy birthday.

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:48.790
Thank you.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:50.040
Can I open it?

00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:51.500
Yeah.

00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:57.920
Huh, cologne?

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:02.000
You don't wear accessories, do you, Shirasaki?

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:02.880
Right.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.750
So I got you this instead.

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:09.420
Wow, this is great. It's so cool.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.130
I thought it would suit you.

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:17.420
Is this how you see me,
Asami-san?

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:20.540
What about this one?

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:28.670
This is your scent, Asami-san.

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:33.630
Since we're going to be apart for a while...

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:38.040
I wanted to give you something
you could always have with you.

00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:43.670
I'm so happy.

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:47.210
I'll cherish it.

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:07.920
You know...

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:12.710
I have a dream.

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:15.540
Yeah?

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:21.420
My dream is...

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:24.420
to act with you again.

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:34.130
That's my dream.

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:44.210
Me too...

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:44.380

(The End)

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:46.580
("At 25:00, in Akasaka" Season 2 Daytime Dream Another Side)
Delivery.

00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:47.420
Yamato.

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:48.830
("A Daydream" Spin-off)
Here, it's ready.

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.880
You don't have to force a smile for me.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.580
(Another love story intertwined between them.)
My heart aches when I'm with you.

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:56.330
It's been this way since the day
you made a delivery to my company.

00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:58.420
If you tell me this is a joke, I'll kill you.

00:23:58.540 --> 00:23:59.630
I'm in love with you.
