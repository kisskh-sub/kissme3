[Legend of the Magnate]

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.009
[Episode 23]

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:39.060
Earlier today, when you

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.530
took me into the city,

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.400
you never thought

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.160
I'd make it back alive, did you?

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.229
Mr. Gu,

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:54.789
where is this coming from?

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.500
What qualifications do I have

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.810
to be the Pacification Commissioner?

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.970
I offered Her Majesty the Empress Dowager

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.430
some Orchid Snow tea,

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.259
which offended the Sixth Prince.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.030
And yet he still wanted me

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.160
to be the Pacification Commissioner?

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.430
What sense does that make?

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.590
Well...

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.240
Mr. Gu,

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.680
you've got that wrong.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.630
From what you're saying,

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:25.960
since you already knew,

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:27.400
why did you still go?

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.120
Yes,

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.560
I knew.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.090
Even knowing the risks, I had to go!

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.120
I wanted to

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.810
save whoever I could!

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.250
I'm sorry, my Lords.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.950
Now that everything is settled here...

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.420
I'll go back to my village to grow tea.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.140
From now on,

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:03.920
I will never again

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.900
try to outshine you, my Lords.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.520
This commoner didn't know any better

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.800
and caused much offense.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.860
I'll drink this one

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:14.730
as punishment.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.500
Mr. Gu, Mr. Gu,

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.190
you've misunderstood!
You've misunderstood me!

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.110
This is absolutely not the case!

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.750
My Lord,

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.320
you're an official, and I'm a commoner!

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.400
How could there be any misunderstanding?

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.590
-Come down first.
-Mr. Gu!

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:39.610
Don't act rashly!

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.210
His Highness didn't mean it that way!

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.910
And you're not just a commoner!

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.280
You're the Pacification Commissioner
appointed by the imperial court!

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.079
You still hold the appointment!

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.310
If you leave now, it will be seen as
defying the court—

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.280
as inviting disaster!

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.410
Inviting disaster?

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.870
Come and arrest me then!

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.750
Hyah!

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.240
You...

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:59.280
Well...

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:04.800
Let him go.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.120
We'll just risk a few harsh words—

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.430
just say we couldn't keep him here.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.150
A man like him is too stubborn
and too lucky.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:12.930
Once he learns

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:13.560
our ways,

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.530
we won't be able to rein him in.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.420
But what if the court asks about this?

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.200
Tomorrow we attack Hefei.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.600
With such a great military achievement,

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.830
even the Empress Dowager herself

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:27.680
couldn't

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.520
punish us arbitrarily for this.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:33.090
Come on.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.190
Back to drinking.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.400
My friend,

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.510
missing home?

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.010
[Safe]

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:00.250
What's happening?

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.140
The imperial court is going to kill us!

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.630
Everyone, let's stick together
and rush out!

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:06.740
Run quickly!

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:07.300
Fire!

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:39.830
[Safe]

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:53.360
Congratulations, Governor Qiao.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.390
Without shedding a drop of blood,

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:56.790
you've eliminated so many enemies at once!

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.980
Good thing your friend isn't around.

00:06:59.150 --> 00:06:59.750
If he were,

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.100
this wouldn't have gone so smoothly.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:03.760
It's heaven's will.

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:54.380
Help...

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:56.920
Help me...

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:46.790
Mr. Gu, you're awake.

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:48.270
Your qi and blood surged to your heart,

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:49.200
causing damage to your internal organs.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.000
I've brewed some herbal medicine for you.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:51.610
Here...

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:54.820
Killing those who surrender
brings misfortune.

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.550
Killing those who surrender
brings misfortune!

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:02.790
Misfortune?

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.110
Gu,

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.250
I'm not like you.

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:07.960
I'm not that lucky.

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:09.600
My position

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:12.200
was earned through battle after battle!

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.270
Because of this war,

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:16.790
my brother and elderly mother are missing.

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:19.600
Now, you tell me about misfortune?

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:22.510
Then misfortune it is.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.240
We've already started attacking Hefei.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.670
By nightfall at the latest,

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:29.930
Hefei will fall!

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.240
This great military merit

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:33.170
will be credited to all three of us!

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:38.900
Attack!

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:39.970
Attack!

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:45.450
This will earn us great merit!

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:07.790
Gu.

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:11.670
If you really walk out this gate,

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:12.750
then from now on,

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:15.280
I'll have no choice
but to treat you as a rebel.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.460
Your mother and brother
are still out there.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.690
Is this really worth the price?

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:25.280
Come with me.

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:46.920
[Marshal]

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.320
Her Majesty the Empress Dowager's decree.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.080
Gu.

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:37.310
"Whether they surrender or not,

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:39.350
execute them immediately."

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.960
It's Her Majesty's order.

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:56.130
Gu, don't act on impulse.

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:57.840
Let me ask you something.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.120
Given the current situation,

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.520
do you think they can win?

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:03.320
Whether they surrender

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.360
or die in battle,

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.720
the imperial court will never spare them.

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:07.690
You know it.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:15.760
My friend, I too am a scholar.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.600
[Marshal]

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.750
I don't want to carry out this order

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:21.360
to kill those who surrender.

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:23.470
But I thought it over—

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:26.030
if I don't do it, someone else will.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:28.970
A court like this...

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:32.810
What's the point in saving it?

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.390
Gu,

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:36.840
about killing those who surrender,

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.300
we can't be soft-hearted.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.150
The men Li Cheng commands

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:41.480
are all veteran rebels!

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:42.910
They've been fighting for 10 years!

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:44.390
You expect them to suddenly obey the law

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:45.510
and live as good citizens?

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:46.510
Is that possible?

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:51.150
In times like these,
if you want to be a good person,

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:51.750
fine—

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.450
go home and grow tea.

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:54.200
Here's a chance to save

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.010
400,000 civilian households,

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.000
but you run off just to keep

00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:58.910
your reputation clean.

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:00.970
Isn't that too selfish?

Are you hurt?

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:35.800
I'm fine.

I'm afraid we can't hold this place
until nightfall.

In a moment,

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.450
I'll send a cavalry unit

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:51.110
to escort you out of the city.

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:52.710
What did you say?

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.180
Escort you out of the city.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.330
You want to send me away?

00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:59.150
Where am I supposed to go?

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.360

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:06.480

we shall share the same grave in death.

Do you want me to go to a place

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:20.300
where I know no one

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:22.530
and beg for food until I die?

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:23.920
I won't leave.

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:33.080
Commanding General Li Cheng and his family

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:34.640
will be placed elsewhere!

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:49.720
These two are

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:51.440
rebel leaders and will be sent
to the capital in chains!

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:52.870
Keep a close eye on them!

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.200
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.410
He's dying!

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:42.400
Are you going to send

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.860
his corpse to the capital?

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:47.920
The man is dying!

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.290
Someone, help!

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:00.710
Anyone, help!

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:05.550
Help!

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:25.030
This is the best trauma powder

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:26.030
I could find.

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:27.190
[Trauma Powder]

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:28.050
Apply it to him.

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.740
It will keep him alive for now.

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:33.280
You want to throw me in a prison cart

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.660
and take me to the capital,

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:39.640
so the Emperor can watch my head fall

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.570
to the ground at the Meridian Gate, right?

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.240
Otherwise,

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.270
the Emperor will get angry,

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.490
and you'll all lose
your official positions.

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:00.510
Li Cheng,

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:03.680
you've greatly misunderstood me.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.240
Those soldiers who surrendered

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:09.110
now lie buried beneath the city.

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:13.790
They all believed your words

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.270
and went out.

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:21.170
Four hundred and sixty-one lives.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.570
I remember them all.

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:26.510
If there's retribution,

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:27.850
I won't hide from it.

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.150
But I must keep the promise

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:33.640
I made to Mr. Bai.

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:35.790
Bai Yimei—

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:38.360
I must ensure her safety.

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:41.310
Enough, Gu.

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.210
You're a high official.

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:45.680
I'm just a commoner.

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.240
You don't need to worry about my life.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.570
I'm not going anywhere.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:51.880
What I mean is,

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:54.910
I want both of you to live.

00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:00.110
I'm the defending general of Anhui.

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.030
Save me?

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:05.970
How many heads do you think you have
to spare?

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:07.830
Nanjing has fallen.

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:09.680
On June 16th,

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.040
the city walls collapsed

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:13.970
and all nine gates fell.

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:16.960
After ten days of burning, killing,
and looting,

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:18.200
Nanjing is now a city

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:19.940
of utter devastation—

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:21.530
its tragedy beyond words.

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:24.370
Time to wake up from your dreams of

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.920
being Prince and Princess Consort.

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.110
From now on,

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:32.310
you need to live for yourselves.

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:35.110
Even if the King of Hell

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.320
wants to take your lives now,

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:40.350
I'll do everything possible

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:41.440
to pull you back.

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:44.410
Just don't give up on yourselves.

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:46.480
Take care.

Go with him.

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:24.440
What nonsense...

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.900
Neither of us can escape
if you take me along.

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:28.960
Go with him.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:31.930
If I wanted to go with him...

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.850
why did I run out in the first place?

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.720
If we die, we die together.

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:41.510
Li,

00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:43.350
you can't decide for me!

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:44.510
No one can!

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:45.920
What about our child?

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:53.350
Can our child decide for you?

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:03.000
You're pregnant.

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:06.400
Why didn't you tell me?

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:17.260
Promise me...

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:21.920
you'll keep this child alive.

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:25.510
Through him,

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:28.030
I live on.

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:33.960
No. No, no.

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:36.710
I'm not going.

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:38.950
We'll all survive together.

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:40.320
Rest well and heal.

We'll all be fine.

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:43.640
We'll all survive.

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:45.290
Just like you said—

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:47.160
the God in heaven

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:49.040
will help us.

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:50.240
Whatever we've done,

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.430
He will forgive us.

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:01.750
Don't waste your strength.

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:05.790
Lie down beside me for a while.

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:21.790
Are you going to leave me alone...

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:26.750
in this world?

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:34.510
Li Cheng!

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:50.620
I heard you've been commended.

00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:53.370
I haven't had a chance
to congratulate you yet.

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:15.260
Don't you think

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:16.510
you owe me an explanation?

00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:17.790
What do I need to explain?

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:18.750
I didn't kill

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:19.460
those 400-plus surrendered soldiers.

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:20.790
I knew nothing about it.

00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:22.790
If you don't believe me,

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:23.590
go on, kill me.

00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:24.440
If I didn't believe you,

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:26.770
do you think you would still be breathing?

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:29.720
I tried to

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:31.460
persuade Li Cheng.

00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:33.720
He's set on dying.

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:35.830
I can't change his mind.

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:37.640
Aren't you supposed to be the clever one?

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:39.350
Don't you know how to persuade someone?

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:42.080
Before becoming
Pacification Commissioner...

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:43.680
I thought with my ability

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:44.590
and wisdom,

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:46.880
I could change things.

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:48.830
But after taking this position,

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:49.890
I realized that...

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:52.900
all I can do is go with the flow.

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:55.590
I can't change anything.

00:24:58.720 --> 00:24:59.980
The so-called history

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:03.360
is merely an emperor's family genealogy.

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:05.090
How ridiculous.

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.610
So you've become enlightened.

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.150
Are you planning to go back to growing tea

00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:18.400
or become a monk?

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:21.200
I'm not going anywhere.

00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:24.720
Since I've already

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.510
been dragged into this matter,

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:29.310
I must Li Cheng and his wife's

00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:30.270
safety.

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:35.200
I need your help.

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:44.380
Go ahead.

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:45.830
Recently,

00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:49.840
I've been reading
the imperial court bulletins.

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.100
It's like doing business.

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:54.510
I need to understand the situation.

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:56.560
To those officials at court,

00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:57.890
Li Cheng and his men

00:25:58.110 --> 00:25:59.510
are like merchandise,

00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:02.550
waiting to be sold to the highest bidder.

00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:03.640
They can be handed over
to the Empress Dowager

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.070
in exchange for an official position

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:06.640
or recruited under one's own command

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:07.900
to expand one's power.

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:09.400
In these chaotic times,

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.920
one might gain greater fame and fortune
with them.

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:14.920
However, this batch of merchandise

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:16.570
can't be kept for too long.

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:17.270
They told me

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:19.910
they wouldn't kill
innocent people indiscriminately.

00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:20.970
I don't trust them.

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:23.030
That's why I stayed.

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:25.500
You don't believe them?

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:26.350
Of course not.

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:30.960
Fame and profit—

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:34.050
fame comes first, and profit follows.

00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:36.890
What nonsense about
"scholars having a conscience"?

00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:37.510
That's only because

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:40.200
they haven't risen high enough
in officialdom yet.

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.110
When it truly comes to trading lives

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:43.790
for an official position,

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:45.720
who would care about

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:47.270
what they once said?

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:50.920
For the people

00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:53.200
and the safety of Hefei,

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:55.510
I need someone more powerful

00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:57.270
to help me.

00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:01.790
I've run out of leverage.

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:03.520
I need someone with real clout

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.160
to back me up.

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:11.260
Who do you suggest?

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.540
Have you heard of Marshal Jiu?

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:14.790
The foremost marshal

00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:16.650
under the Viceroy of Liangjiang.

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:18.610
From what I know,

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:20.750
his military force is formidable,

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:22.080
unmatched in the world.

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:23.200
He is the person with real clout

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:24.310
that I have in mind.

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:29.160
I'm afraid even you wouldn't be able to

00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:31.550
approach such a heroic figure.

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:38.520
You're trying to goad me into it.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.390
Jiu owes me a favor.

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:44.330
He should feel honored

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:46.110
that I even bother to see him.

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:55.510
Report!

00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:57.650
Marshal Jiu

00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:00.010
from the Jiangning camp has sent a letter.

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.310
Double the guard at noon.

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:17.200
Go to the city and order

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:18.310
the best Yan cuisine banquet!

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:18.840
Yes, sir!

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:32.510
Jiu is utterly arrogant and disrespectful!

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:33.880
He's been besieging Jiangning
for three years

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.160
without gaining an inch of land!

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:36.030
Now he comes here

00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:37.440
to steal my credit!

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:38.550
What should we do?

00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:41.830
I'll write a memorial to impeach him!

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:45.530
I've only heard that the man carries
a murderous air.

00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:46.550
Throughout the Yangtze region,

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:48.310
the army under his command

00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:49.590
is the most powerful.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.860
We must not offend him to his face.

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.240
As for a memorial,

00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:56.310
the imperial court is
counting on his service.

00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:57.310
If you file a report,

00:28:57.310 --> 00:28:59.040
will the court side with him...

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:00.310
or with you?

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:02.030
Then what should I do?

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:04.920
Those prisoners of war are elite soldiers.

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.120
Hefei has been taken,

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:07.880
and now he just writes a note

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:09.160
saying he's going to come take

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:09.750
those 1,000-plus prisoners

00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:11.100
to incorporate into his army.

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:11.880
Isn't that...

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.540
Isn't that outright robbery?

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:17.590
Send Li Cheng and his wife to the capital

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:19.510
in chains to present them to the court,

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:21.510
and just give those prisoners
to Marshal Jiu.

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:22.650
He should at least leave us

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:24.270
some scraps, right?

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:27.490
That's also how things work
in officialdom.

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:28.260
Report!

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:31.000
Marshal Jiu's advance troops have arrived
at the camp gate!

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.030
Set up the ceremonial formation!

00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:33.030
All of you, look sharp!

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:33.880
We'll wait outside the camp

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:35.610
to welcome Marshal Jiu!

00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:36.460
Yes, sir!

00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:56.090
Where's our tea-selling

00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:57.750
Pacification Commissioner?

00:29:58.350 --> 00:29:59.550
This man, Gu Pingyuan,

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:00.830
is neither truly a scholar

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:02.030
nor truly a merchant.

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:04.840
Why are you keeping such a close eye
on him?

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:07.080
I fear his intentions

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:09.030
are no longer aligned with ours.

00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:10.550
If we don't keep a close eye on him,

00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:11.880
there might be trouble.

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:14.000
San!

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:18.440
Go invite Lord Gu here immediately.

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:19.680
Tell him Marshal Jiu has arrived.

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:21.070
As the subordinates,
we're hosting a banquet,

00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:22.110
and he is obliged to attend.

00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:22.640
Yes, sir.

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:26.110
He's here.

00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:45.710
What an impressive display!

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.830
Jiu's carriage is quite novel.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.060
That's a foreign-style carriage,
like a turtle shell.

00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:04.970
-Welcome, Marshal Jiu!
-Welcome, Marshal Jiu!

00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:06.830
-Welcome, Marshal Jiu!
-Welcome, Marshal Jiu!

00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:09.490
-Welcome, Marshal Jiu!
-Welcome, Marshal Jiu!

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:14.030
[Marshal of Jiangning, Marshal Jiu]

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:33.330
Rise.

00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:42.110
I dare not trouble you with this.

00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:47.910
You two have worked hard.

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.170
I heard about the victory at Hefei,

00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:56.160
and I haven't had the chance
to congratulate you yet.

00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:57.240
This small achievement

00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:58.640
can't compare to yours—

00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:00.400
years of bloody battles at Jiangning.

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:02.360
It's hardly worth mentioning.

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:03.410
Governor Qiao.

00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:05.590
Mr. Bao Qing.

00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:11.920
He's a descendant
of an old friend of mine.

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:13.610
I just ran into him on the road—

00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:15.120
he kept me company.

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:16.950
You all know each other?

00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:18.170
Of course.

00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:20.520
Mr. Gu is the Pacification Commissioner
personally appointed

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:22.110
by Her Majesty the Empress Dowager.

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:23.460
Amid the fierce battle,

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:25.400
Mr. Gu has accomplished great merit.

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:26.440
I was just looking for him

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:28.840
but didn't expect to find him here
with you.

00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:31.270
Isn't it hot standing out here?

00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:32.640
After the meal, I'll take the men with me.

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:33.500
Yes, of course.

00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:34.710
Please, Marshal Jiu.

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:37.160
Mr. Gu,

00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:39.190
you actually know Marshal Jiu?

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:41.440
We've known each other for a long time.

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:54.550
There are only about 1,000

00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:56.150
prisoners of war from Hefei?

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.460
What about the others?

00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:02.730
Where are the others?

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:05.300
All killed?

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:08.060
Buried to fertilize the soil?

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:08.720
No.

00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:10.160
After such a long siege,

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.880
some starved to death,
while others escaped.

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:12.950
Those 1,000 or so

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.640
are the ones
who fought to their last breath

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:15.720
protecting their commander, Li Cheng.

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:17.450
They're all severely wounded.

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:19.510
Marshal Jiu, I'm afraid
you can't transport them now.

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:20.960
It's better to leave them here.

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.310
Once they've recovered,

00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:23.260
I'll tie them up

00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:24.720
and send them to your camp.

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:25.750
Not long ago, I was
in the thick of battle,

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:27.210
and my forces were strong!

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:28.590
But damn it,

00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:31.240
a plague wiped out half my troops.

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:34.090
I need to replenish my forces immediately!

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:39.760
Those over 1,000 prisoners—

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:44.110
as long as they're breathing,
I'm taking them all.

00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:46.280
Marshal Jiu,

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:47.910
those 1,000-plus prisoners

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:49.510
are indeed severely wounded.

00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:50.590
Let us

00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:51.990
reorganize them for you—

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:53.410
shave their heads,

00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:55.350
feed them well,

00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:56.110
dress them warmly,

00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:57.310
restore their spirits,

00:33:57.310 --> 00:33:59.010
and then deliver them to you.

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.600
Wouldn't that be better?

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:07.180
Will you even be able to
send them by then?

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:10.060
You think I don't know?

00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:10.960
You want to incorporate

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:13.020
those captives into your own troops.

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:14.360
Then later,

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:16.510
you'll send me a bunch of old, weak, sick,
and disabled leftovers

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:17.710
to fool me, is that it?

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:20.670
Are you envious of my military success

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:22.520
and want a share?

00:34:26.070 --> 00:34:26.670
Please.

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:29.710
Marshal Jiu,

00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:31.030
I wouldn't dare, wouldn't dare.

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:32.989
If you want them, just take them.

00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:34.120
How would we dare

00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:36.239
compete with you, Marshal Jiu?

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:38.250
I want Li Cheng too.

00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:40.920
He's being held in prison.

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:43.870
We're preparing to send him to the capital
in chains immediately.

00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:45.870
But we can't give this person to you.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.290
We've worked so hard for so long.

00:34:47.290 --> 00:34:48.400
Otherwise, we'd have no credit

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:49.330
for our efforts.

00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:56.290
For a tiny little Hefei,

00:34:57.550 --> 00:34:58.880
you besieged it for so long,

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:00.340
asked for so much money...

00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:04.100
and now you still want credit?

00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:06.320
Marshal Jiu.

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:08.480
He's

00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:10.550
the only valuable piece we have left.

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:12.030
You wave your hand

00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:13.440
and take all those prisoners—fine.

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:14.400
At least leave us

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:16.710
something to earn a promotion with!

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:18.280
You've got a death wish?

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:21.170
No, no, no.

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:23.030
Why are you shouting at Marshal Jiu
like this?

00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.440
You...

00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:26.270
You're going too far!

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:26.710
Bao...

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:31.310
What disgraceful behavior!

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:32.510
Well...

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:34.280
This is outrageous.

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:35.540
What's this all about?

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:37.030
I told him.

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:41.240
Apart from those 1,000-plus prisoners...

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:44.400
I want Li Cheng

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:46.150
as well.

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:48.000
That's...

00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:51.190
Well... T-That really won't do.

00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:51.960
Won't do?

00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:54.440
Won't do.

00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:56.300
Won't do?

00:35:57.880 --> 00:35:58.360
Well...

00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:00.410
You want this, you want that!

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:02.590
You should at least leave us something!

00:36:02.590 --> 00:36:03.920
You dare to fight me over a prisoner?

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:04.880
You... keep...

00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:16.610
You need to keep your word.

00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:19.030
I avenged you.

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:21.030
So you're just taking them by force?

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:22.590
I'm not a businessman.

00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:25.640
I'm here precisely to take what I want.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.450
But you'll have to

00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:28.760
repay this favor.

00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:06.360
He's not dead yet, is he?

00:37:06.370 --> 00:37:07.100
Marshal Jiu!

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:09.300
Marshal Jiu, Marshal Jiu.

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:11.150
Get them out for me.

00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:12.410
I'll take both of them.

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:14.690
Marshal Jiu,

00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:16.330
these two are supposed to be

00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:17.760
sent to the capital in shackles.

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:18.960
If you take them both,

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.800
how can we explain it
to the Empress Dowager

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:21.920
and the Emperor? Please...

00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:23.120
at least leave us one.

00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:24.440
Yes, yes.

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:28.710
Even crickets are kept in pairs.

00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:31.470
One alone won't survive.

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:33.110
Take them both.

00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:33.710
Let's go!

00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:03.360
Gu, you invited Marshal Jiu here?

00:38:05.830 --> 00:38:06.890
Ms. Su invited him.

00:38:08.090 --> 00:38:09.320
Jiu is notorious for

00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:11.870
being merciless
and leaving nothing behind.

00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:13.800
I originally thought I'd face him

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:15.310
on the battlefield—

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:16.920
never thought I'd end up

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:18.180
at his mercy like this.

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:20.630
He's the Qing court's general.

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:22.280
How could he possibly save us?

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.540
Don't be fooled by him.

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:26.720
The price must've been high, hm?

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:30.490
Indeed, the price is high.

00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:33.230
But Gu, the money you spent

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:34.400
might only be enough to save

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:36.230
my wife and me.

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:39.440
If you want all my men

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:40.590
to live as well,

00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:43.030
how should you negotiate this deal?

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:52.250
Please show some mercy.

00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:54.770
Give my men a chance to live.

00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:57.110
Mercy?

00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:23.010
Marshal Jiu means that...

00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:26.080
your men can be released...

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:28.390
but you two

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:30.160
must join his troops.

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:33.000
And he wants you to serve under him

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.150
as a military adviser.

00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:35.280
That way, he can justify himself

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:36.320
to his subordinates

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:37.780
and to the imperial court.

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:39.390
After the war is over,

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:40.950
he'll send you back home.

00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:43.330
Gu, you've risked your life

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:44.800
and braved danger for us.

00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:48.120
I won't make things difficult for you.

00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:49.790
Bring me the clothes.

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:51.570
I accept your offer.

00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:56.320
Stop!

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:06.230
I, Zha Lanchai, Vice Commander

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:07.590
of the Tiger Battalion
under Marshal Jiu's command,

00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:10.120
am here to attend to you
while you change, Sir!

00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:28.960
This bandit chief Li

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:30.920
is truly skilled in battle.

00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:33.490
I really don't understand

00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:35.880
how an illiterate child,

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:37.590
a filthy mine laborer,

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:39.960
could have risen so far.

00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:43.320
What a pity.

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:47.210
We couldn't meet on the battlefield.

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:51.940
The Qing Empire's fate is sealed.

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:55.150
Foolish rulers and incompetent ministers
maintain the status quo,

00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:57.560
flattering those above
and oppressing those below,

00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:59.490
yet remain blind to their own doom.

00:41:01.070 --> 00:41:03.470
The military campaign in Jiangnan is over.

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:05.070
Spring has arrived,

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:07.710
and the Central Plains are
ripe for conquest.

00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:08.440
Marshal Jiu.

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:13.000
Are you interested in
claiming the Central Plains?

00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:28.110
[Delusion]

00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:32.060
[Delusion]

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:35.800
This is a fine blade
Marshal Jiu had forged

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:37.000
by master craftsmen.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.400
Only officers who achieve great merit

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:39.190
are rewarded with one.

00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:40.920
General, now that you've turned to
the righteous side,

00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:42.780
your future is certainly bright!

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.130
All of you, sit down!

00:42:47.090 --> 00:42:48.060
I know.

00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:50.370
Wearing these robes

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:53.770
betrays our men who died in battle.

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:56.260
But if I don't wear them...

00:42:57.850 --> 00:43:00.580
I betray the friend who risked his life
to save me.
