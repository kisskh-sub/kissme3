(Moon River)

00:00:09.155 --> 00:00:10.485
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

00:00:10.555 --> 00:00:11.785
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

00:00:11.855 --> 00:00:13.125
(Also, children and animals were filmed under production guidelines.)

00:00:16.555 --> 00:00:18.295
How could I ever be angry with you?

00:00:19.565 --> 00:00:21.835
You are the sole exception to all my anger.

00:00:24.035 --> 00:00:26.505
I meant to tell you after my revenge was complete.

00:00:29.575 --> 00:00:31.205
But you are having such foolish thoughts,

00:00:33.915 --> 00:00:35.445
so I have no choice but to tell you now.

00:00:39.815 --> 00:00:40.815
That I...

00:00:52.295 --> 00:00:53.825
I am very deeply...

00:00:56.835 --> 00:00:57.835
in love...

00:01:00.235 --> 00:01:01.235
with you, Park Dal.

00:01:11.445 --> 00:01:12.445
Me too.

00:02:52.585 --> 00:02:55.615
Wait. You found the Jimjo in Mount Inwang Cave?

00:02:56.285 --> 00:02:58.485
It was right under our noses. Goodness.

00:02:58.685 --> 00:02:59.685
Tell me about it.

00:03:00.755 --> 00:03:03.595
So, since you have found its habitat,

00:03:03.995 --> 00:03:05.525
does that mean you can get the Left State Councilor?

00:03:05.865 --> 00:03:08.835
The Choraengi Mask set off a bomb,

00:03:09.395 --> 00:03:10.835
and it wiped out all traces of the Jimjo.

00:03:11.105 --> 00:03:13.965
Did you not say the Chief Court Lady was the one in the Choraengi Mask?

00:03:14.435 --> 00:03:16.275
It turns out there was another one.

00:03:16.535 --> 00:03:19.475
What? Then why did you not catch him?

00:03:19.645 --> 00:03:23.375
He knew the cave's layout well, shook off 12 of our men,

00:03:23.975 --> 00:03:25.315
then he blew himself up inside.

00:03:28.455 --> 00:03:29.815
So, what do we do now?

00:03:30.755 --> 00:03:32.185
The Choraengi Mask is dead,

00:03:32.755 --> 00:03:33.955
and the cave collapsed.

00:03:34.555 --> 00:03:35.555
And because of me,

00:03:36.395 --> 00:03:38.325
the Jimjo is gone forever.

00:03:38.565 --> 00:03:39.565
Gosh.

00:03:39.925 --> 00:03:42.195
You have to make me seem pathetic, do you not?

00:03:43.035 --> 00:03:44.605
Every time I save you,

00:03:44.905 --> 00:03:47.335
just say I was amazing or that you have fallen for me.

00:03:47.875 --> 00:03:49.135
That would be enough.

00:03:51.175 --> 00:03:53.005
You are not wrong, but...

00:03:57.175 --> 00:03:59.415
You just stop there.

00:04:00.315 --> 00:04:01.315
For my part,

00:04:02.755 --> 00:04:06.225
I will just be grateful you are alive, and we will leave it at that.

00:04:06.825 --> 00:04:07.825
Okay?

00:04:12.525 --> 00:04:14.765
- How is your back? - It is all better now.

00:04:15.365 --> 00:04:17.065
Good. That is all that matters.

00:04:17.735 --> 00:04:18.735
Let us get some sleep.

00:04:26.175 --> 00:04:27.175
Gosh...

00:04:28.415 --> 00:04:29.415
Gosh...

00:04:30.315 --> 00:04:31.685
Are you trying to squeeze the life out of me?

00:04:32.245 --> 00:04:34.485
Why are you hugging me so tight?

00:04:34.785 --> 00:04:35.785
You have no idea...

00:04:36.255 --> 00:04:37.525
what my lonely nights have been like.

00:04:39.725 --> 00:04:44.295
Say what you will, I will not let go. So hug me back tight.

00:05:02.175 --> 00:05:04.885
The Crown Prince's Concubine used the chick to lure its mother,

00:05:05.285 --> 00:05:08.185
and His Royal Highness killed the Jimjo himself?

00:05:11.085 --> 00:05:12.485
Because of one woman,

00:05:13.585 --> 00:05:15.955
five years of hard work went down the drain.

00:05:16.395 --> 00:05:18.664
- Sir? - Take the carcass,

00:05:18.665 --> 00:05:20.195
and clean up the scene well.

00:05:20.465 --> 00:05:21.465
Yes, sir.

00:05:25.005 --> 00:05:29.635
A young Jimjo's venom is too weak to serve as evidence.

00:05:30.435 --> 00:05:34.075
Now that the Jimjo and all traces of it are gone,

00:05:34.575 --> 00:05:35.944
the truth of what happened in the Gyesa Year...

00:05:35.945 --> 00:05:38.515
will remain a secret forever.

00:05:38.645 --> 00:05:42.185
(Chapter Nine: Curiosity, There Are No Secrets)

00:06:59.425 --> 00:07:00.465
Gosh.

00:07:02.935 --> 00:07:04.635
It is disturbing Dal's sleep.

00:07:12.605 --> 00:07:13.775
Hey, you punk!

00:07:23.355 --> 00:07:26.925
- Go get that thing. - "That thing"?

00:07:32.195 --> 00:07:33.225
No...

00:07:41.975 --> 00:07:45.445
Royal Mother! Why are you...

00:07:45.845 --> 00:07:49.845
Royal Mother! What is happening?

00:07:50.775 --> 00:07:51.785
Royal Mother

00:07:52.815 --> 00:07:53.815
Royal Mother.

00:08:13.665 --> 00:08:15.105
I am back in my own body now.

00:08:17.105 --> 00:08:19.745
So why do I keep dreaming about the Crown Princess?

00:08:29.755 --> 00:08:30.755
What?

00:09:04.625 --> 00:09:06.025
Now that the Jimjo is dead...

00:09:06.455 --> 00:09:08.525
and the Mount Inwang Cave lies in ruins,

00:09:09.395 --> 00:09:10.955
what do you plan to do?

00:09:12.465 --> 00:09:15.995
The Jimjo will be dismissed as a tragic omen.

00:09:17.765 --> 00:09:20.065
The people are in an uproar over this monstrous bird,

00:09:20.505 --> 00:09:23.605
so you should hold an exorcism rite to appease them.

00:09:23.905 --> 00:09:24.945
An exorcism rite?

00:09:26.245 --> 00:09:29.045
So the Jimjo is a curse sent from the skies?

00:09:29.415 --> 00:09:30.575
Otherwise,

00:09:31.045 --> 00:09:35.815
someone dared send a Jimjo into Your Majesty's palace.

00:09:36.185 --> 00:09:39.025
Are you suggesting this is an act of treason?

00:09:39.285 --> 00:09:42.795
So whoever sent the Jimjo is a traitor?

00:09:44.195 --> 00:09:45.265
So that is it.

00:09:45.765 --> 00:09:48.965
The reason he made me release the Jimjo myself.

00:09:55.605 --> 00:09:58.345
The Book of Rites is clear.

00:09:58.975 --> 00:10:00.105
According to it,

00:10:00.445 --> 00:10:02.844
A monarch in mourning should not rejoice,

00:10:02.845 --> 00:10:05.185
and one should not hold celebrations during a time of mourning.

00:10:06.445 --> 00:10:07.885
The Left State Councilor's point is a valid one.

00:10:08.185 --> 00:10:09.315
We will hold an exorcism rite,

00:10:10.355 --> 00:10:11.885
and I will suspend the Royal Wedding.

00:10:16.355 --> 00:10:19.995
What? What are you talking about? The Royal Wedding is in five days.

00:10:20.395 --> 00:10:21.864
How can you suspend the wedding?

00:10:21.865 --> 00:10:24.965
He is right, Your Highness. Comparing the Jimjo...

00:10:25.335 --> 00:10:27.065
to a monarch in mourning is not appropriate.

00:10:27.235 --> 00:10:31.875
Even past kings postponed feasts for hail, drought, or poor harvests.

00:10:31.945 --> 00:10:32.945
So holding the Royal Wedding...

00:10:33.445 --> 00:10:35.945
in the face of an omen like this...

00:10:36.315 --> 00:10:37.985
would be utterly absurd, would it not?

00:10:44.785 --> 00:10:47.055
Now that I have stopped the wedding using the omen as an excuse,

00:10:47.455 --> 00:10:48.624
the Left State Councilor will soon claim...

00:10:48.625 --> 00:10:49.824
the Jimjo was a man-made disaster...

00:10:49.825 --> 00:10:51.995
and try to find someone to take the fall.

00:10:52.465 --> 00:10:54.935
Yes, he will likely pin it on the former Chief Court Lady Jo.

00:10:55.065 --> 00:10:56.365
The Jimjo's cave on Mount Inwang...

00:10:56.735 --> 00:10:58.305
is connected to Jo's brewery.

00:10:58.705 --> 00:11:01.535
That brewery once belonged to the Left State Councilor.

00:11:02.935 --> 00:11:06.945
But this deed lists someone else as the seller.

00:11:07.275 --> 00:11:08.745
So, I should find this person?

00:11:09.515 --> 00:11:12.685
Find proof the Left State Councilor sold the brewery to this man.

00:11:13.385 --> 00:11:15.815
And after I find him, what is next?

00:11:16.315 --> 00:11:17.315
After that,

00:11:20.985 --> 00:11:21.995
be happy.

00:11:24.895 --> 00:11:26.124
Once the Left State Councilor is arrested,

00:11:26.125 --> 00:11:27.895
the Royal Wedding will be canceled.

00:11:28.235 --> 00:11:30.735
That is when you must run away with the Crown Princess Consort.

00:11:31.235 --> 00:11:33.465
- Gang. - Live well, wherever you go.

00:11:34.535 --> 00:11:35.775
Do not be in pain anymore,

00:11:37.005 --> 00:11:38.105
and do not be lonely.

00:11:46.815 --> 00:11:49.015
What will you do now?

00:11:49.185 --> 00:11:51.325
We fell for the Crown Prince's trap.

00:11:51.385 --> 00:11:53.724
The Crown Prince and his concubine are so obviously in love,

00:11:53.725 --> 00:11:55.155
the whole palace can tell.

00:11:55.355 --> 00:11:59.125
And now with the wedding postponed, what if the concubine gets pregnant?

00:11:59.765 --> 00:12:01.835
Would that not be a total disaster?

00:12:02.265 --> 00:12:03.265
Our Crown Prince...

00:12:03.995 --> 00:12:06.805
has matured a great deal in the meantime.

00:12:06.905 --> 00:12:10.375
This is hardly the time to stand around admiring him!

00:12:10.775 --> 00:12:11.775
However,

00:12:13.175 --> 00:12:15.575
a tree that grows higher than the ceiling...

00:12:17.315 --> 00:12:18.945
must be chopped down.

00:12:26.285 --> 00:12:28.855
I should be going now.

00:12:34.795 --> 00:12:35.935
Come on.

00:12:36.465 --> 00:12:38.605
Gang, how can you be so careless with my wedding gift?

00:12:41.675 --> 00:12:43.205
- Wedding gift? - Yes.

00:12:43.405 --> 00:12:45.475
U Hui trusts me with her life.

00:12:45.645 --> 00:12:48.045
I cannot give her a grand affair, but we should have a ceremony.

00:12:49.015 --> 00:12:52.185
A ceremony? Is that really what matters?

00:12:53.345 --> 00:12:54.345
Gang.

00:12:54.585 --> 00:12:57.085
When you buy a house, do you sign a deed or not?

00:12:57.655 --> 00:12:59.385
When you buy land, do you register the title or not?

00:12:59.625 --> 00:13:02.555
We were talking weddings. Why bring up houses and land now?

00:13:02.755 --> 00:13:04.865
That is what a wedding is all about.

00:13:06.295 --> 00:13:07.895
It is declaring ourselves husband and wife...

00:13:08.335 --> 00:13:09.565
before all the deities of the skies and earth.

00:13:09.865 --> 00:13:13.765
It means no one can tear us apart. It is a thumbprint on a contract.

00:13:16.375 --> 00:13:19.575
- That is what it is all about? - Yes.

00:13:19.645 --> 00:13:21.515
- Really? - Yes.

00:13:23.545 --> 00:13:25.015
Really?

00:13:39.025 --> 00:13:40.065
Have you been waiting long?

00:13:40.725 --> 00:13:42.335
I just got here myself.

00:13:43.265 --> 00:13:45.405
What is that you have there?

00:13:46.035 --> 00:13:49.075
Oh, Gang gave me his word.

00:13:49.775 --> 00:13:52.475
When this is all finished, we will leave together.

00:13:52.745 --> 00:13:54.105
I got this for you.

00:13:56.045 --> 00:13:57.245
I hope you like it.

00:14:01.315 --> 00:14:02.315
You do not like it?

00:14:02.515 --> 00:14:05.185
If I cared for riches and jewels, I would have stayed where I was.

00:14:06.225 --> 00:14:08.655
If I only wanted you for your title, I would have left a long time ago.

00:14:11.225 --> 00:14:12.795
Next time, instead of a wedding gift,

00:14:13.395 --> 00:14:15.195
bring me my father's downfall.

00:14:20.065 --> 00:14:22.035
I cannot leave right away either.

00:14:23.105 --> 00:14:25.445
Because the one who most wants the Left State Councilor's downfall...

00:14:27.005 --> 00:14:29.545
- is me. - Do you have a plan?

00:14:29.945 --> 00:14:31.514
I am looking for the man who sold the brewery...

00:14:31.515 --> 00:14:33.145
to the former Chief Court Lady.

00:14:33.815 --> 00:14:36.915
Was it not my father who sold the brewery?

00:14:38.255 --> 00:14:39.784
Before selling it to her,

00:14:39.785 --> 00:14:42.795
he sold it to someone named Yun Gye Sim.

00:14:43.595 --> 00:14:45.725
Does that name sound familiar?

00:14:46.795 --> 00:14:48.765
No, I do not know.

00:14:49.635 --> 00:14:53.105
I see. I did not expect it to be that easy.

00:14:53.305 --> 00:14:56.705
Either way, I will prove that the Left State Councilor...

00:14:56.905 --> 00:14:58.545
is the master of the Jimjo.

00:15:00.275 --> 00:15:01.275
But...

00:15:02.115 --> 00:15:03.475
are you sure you will be all right with this?

00:15:04.785 --> 00:15:07.685
He is still your father, after all. Are you sure you are okay?

00:15:08.685 --> 00:15:10.955
He has never once considered me his daughter,

00:15:11.825 --> 00:15:13.825
so it is nothing for me to abandon him as my father.

00:15:15.225 --> 00:15:16.225
That is a heartbreaking thing to say.

00:15:30.075 --> 00:15:32.805
Just wait a little longer. I will come for you soon.

00:15:33.705 --> 00:15:36.775
Brother, friend, father, and husband...

00:15:37.615 --> 00:15:39.115
I will be all of those things for you.

00:15:58.605 --> 00:16:01.105
What? A hundred pairs of flower shoes?

00:16:01.505 --> 00:16:04.705
Are these shoes for a centipede or something?

00:16:11.175 --> 00:16:12.445
What are you talking about, you punk?

00:16:15.385 --> 00:16:16.785
Enough with the smart remarks,

00:16:17.615 --> 00:16:18.985
and bring me some paper and a brush.

00:16:19.825 --> 00:16:21.595
I have a special order for you.

00:16:24.995 --> 00:16:27.065
There we go.

00:16:29.535 --> 00:16:30.535
Take a look.

00:16:34.235 --> 00:16:37.135
- Wait, is this... - Yes, as you can see...

00:16:37.205 --> 00:16:38.845
Is this not the number eight from the West?

00:16:39.675 --> 00:16:42.814
How would you know Western numbers, Your Highness?

00:16:42.815 --> 00:16:44.515
What? A number?

00:16:44.545 --> 00:16:47.615
What is this fly in the middle?

00:16:49.685 --> 00:16:51.115
It is a flower.

00:16:53.055 --> 00:16:54.255
A skewer?

00:16:54.555 --> 00:16:56.595
Oh, a silkworm cocoon!

00:16:57.695 --> 00:17:00.665
Not a silkworm cocoon, a flower!

00:17:01.025 --> 00:17:04.935
Look! A flower in the middle. These two rings.

00:17:05.265 --> 00:17:07.035
A double ring with a flower design, you idiot.

00:17:07.705 --> 00:17:11.975
- Is it not? - It is!

00:17:14.005 --> 00:17:16.015
I just do not get...

00:17:16.115 --> 00:17:19.315
why he keeps drawing such things and acting so proud.

00:17:19.785 --> 00:17:20.885
Maybe because he was spoiled rotten?

00:17:28.295 --> 00:17:30.125
This will be a gift for my Royal Concubine,

00:17:30.655 --> 00:17:33.925
so tell the finest artisan to do their absolute best work.

00:17:36.895 --> 00:17:37.895
So dazzling.

00:17:40.335 --> 00:17:41.335
So dazzling.

00:17:43.205 --> 00:17:44.205
So dazzling.

00:17:47.275 --> 00:17:48.315
You ㅁre that happy?

00:17:48.945 --> 00:17:50.245
No.

00:17:50.675 --> 00:17:52.485
It is the umbrella that is beautiful.

00:17:52.945 --> 00:17:55.855
The umbrella is just like a flower.

00:17:56.415 --> 00:17:58.855
I feel like I have seen this flower somewhere.

00:17:59.155 --> 00:18:00.185
What was it called again?

00:18:00.585 --> 00:18:03.855
Then, should you not do something to thank His Royal Highness?

00:18:04.995 --> 00:18:05.995
Thank him?

00:18:08.395 --> 00:18:11.065
He is the Crown Prince. What could he possibly need?

00:18:11.905 --> 00:18:13.805
Besides, he is no ordinary Crown Prince.

00:18:14.305 --> 00:18:16.605
He even has his own wardrobe room at the Royal Office of Attire.

00:18:18.705 --> 00:18:20.545
For someone like that, it is the thought that counts.

00:18:22.145 --> 00:18:23.245
The thought?

00:18:25.315 --> 00:18:26.915
- Your Highness. - Your Highness.

00:18:27.585 --> 00:18:30.755
Royal Concubine. What brings you here, Your Highness?

00:18:30.815 --> 00:18:31.825
It is just that...

00:18:32.285 --> 00:18:34.125
I am trying to make something.

00:18:34.755 --> 00:18:37.625
Do you know what food His Royal Highness enjoys?

00:18:57.315 --> 00:18:58.315
Hey, wait a second.

00:19:00.085 --> 00:19:01.215
What happened to your hands?

00:19:01.485 --> 00:19:04.215
It is nothing. I just scraped it a little.

00:19:06.585 --> 00:19:07.585
Goodness!

00:19:12.365 --> 00:19:14.595
- It is hot. - You said it was just a scrape.

00:19:14.865 --> 00:19:17.335
Five of your ten fingers are all wrapped up in bandages?

00:19:18.235 --> 00:19:20.335
This is unacceptable. I am calling the Royal Physician.

00:19:20.635 --> 00:19:22.574
- Is there anyone? - It is fine!

00:19:22.575 --> 00:19:24.035
Do not make such a fuss.

00:19:24.575 --> 00:19:27.105
- Hurry up and try it. - What do you mean it is nothing?

00:19:28.045 --> 00:19:30.015
To think you went to so much trouble making this...

00:19:30.745 --> 00:19:32.914
- It is just heartbreaking. - Come on.

00:19:32.915 --> 00:19:34.785
But you have done so much for me,

00:19:35.015 --> 00:19:36.015
and you have saved me so many times,

00:19:36.085 --> 00:19:38.185
so I wanted to do something for you, and I worked hard.

00:19:38.255 --> 00:19:39.684
But you keep scolding me. Forget it.

00:19:39.685 --> 00:19:41.025
- Do not eat it. - No.

00:19:43.295 --> 00:19:44.355
Is that what this was about?

00:19:45.925 --> 00:19:47.325
And I had no idea.

00:19:48.895 --> 00:19:49.895
All right.

00:19:50.165 --> 00:19:52.805
Let me taste the pumpkin porridge you sacrificed five fingers for.

00:20:02.975 --> 00:20:05.385
How is it? Is it any good?

00:20:05.785 --> 00:20:07.915
I did not get to taste-test it while I was making it.

00:20:10.685 --> 00:20:11.685
It is delicious.

00:20:12.385 --> 00:20:13.455
Really?

00:20:13.785 --> 00:20:16.355
That is a relief. It is my first time making it.

00:20:16.625 --> 00:20:17.625
Hold on a second.

00:20:18.355 --> 00:20:20.825
It is a shame to eat this porridge all by myself.

00:20:21.525 --> 00:20:25.665
What do you think about sharing some with Shin Won and Se Dol?

00:20:25.805 --> 00:20:29.305
As if I would not think of that. I already gave them each a bowl.

00:21:08.405 --> 00:21:09.445
That was delicious.

00:21:10.375 --> 00:21:13.815
It is so delicious that I am sad to be on the last bite.

00:21:14.515 --> 00:21:15.615
You wish there was more?

00:21:16.255 --> 00:21:19.755
Good thing I saved a portion for myself.

00:21:20.885 --> 00:21:24.555
For me, just watching you enjoy it is enough to make me full.

00:21:28.395 --> 00:21:32.065
But just because the wedding is off, does not mean it is completely over.

00:21:32.465 --> 00:21:34.835
What happens to Grand Prince Je Un and the Crown Prince Consort?

00:21:37.505 --> 00:21:38.505
Your Royal Highness.

00:21:39.145 --> 00:21:40.145
Your Royal Highness?

00:21:40.505 --> 00:21:41.505
Yes?

00:21:42.315 --> 00:21:44.115
Why are you in a cold sweat like that?

00:21:46.015 --> 00:21:47.585
It is just hot in here.

00:21:54.455 --> 00:21:56.025
But your hands and earlobes are ice-cold.

00:21:57.055 --> 00:21:58.665
Then it is because I am cold.

00:21:59.565 --> 00:22:02.165
Make up your mind. Are you hot or are you cold?

00:22:02.595 --> 00:22:03.695
Well, it is...

00:22:03.765 --> 00:22:06.805
You ate two bowls of that vile stuff?

00:22:06.835 --> 00:22:08.435
How could you finish that thing?

00:22:08.465 --> 00:22:10.135
Even Mangdeok would not touch it.

00:22:11.005 --> 00:22:13.005
That "vile stuff" you are referring to...

00:22:13.305 --> 00:22:15.545
Is it the pumpkin porridge I gave you?

00:22:16.545 --> 00:22:18.545
And to think I went out of my way to prepare bowls for both of you.

00:22:18.985 --> 00:22:20.615
What were you thinking?

00:22:21.515 --> 00:22:24.385
Why does Dal have to be a good cook on top of everything else?

00:22:24.985 --> 00:22:26.955
It is not like she entered the palace to be our cook.

00:22:28.125 --> 00:22:29.125
It was delicious.

00:22:30.025 --> 00:22:33.464
Then you should have said something. Why force it down like an idiot?

00:22:33.465 --> 00:22:35.295
So what if I am a bit of an idiot?

00:22:35.865 --> 00:22:37.265
As long as it made you happy, that is all that matters.

00:22:38.065 --> 00:22:39.065
It was delicious.

00:22:40.035 --> 00:22:41.335
You are not quite better yet, are you?

00:22:43.205 --> 00:22:46.545
- Follow me. - What? Where are you taking me?

00:22:46.945 --> 00:22:48.005
In the middle of the day?

00:22:48.975 --> 00:22:50.075
Do not follow us.

00:22:50.545 --> 00:22:53.515
- Go on. - It is completely blocked up.

00:22:53.945 --> 00:22:56.655
You did not have to get sick over that. Gosh.

00:22:58.285 --> 00:23:00.585
Doing pointless things is what romance is.

00:23:00.855 --> 00:23:03.195
Romance? Give me a break.

00:23:07.525 --> 00:23:09.495
It is the middle of the day,

00:23:09.865 --> 00:23:12.535
and a couple is sitting side by side in a private room.

00:23:13.465 --> 00:23:16.975
Plus, they are holding hands and caressing their fingers.

00:23:17.205 --> 00:23:19.005
This is what you call romance, is it not?

00:23:19.075 --> 00:23:21.305
This is not for some impure reason.

00:23:21.745 --> 00:23:23.745
It is purely for therapeutic purposes.

00:23:24.675 --> 00:23:27.785
They say you will not get sick if your body stays warm.

00:23:27.845 --> 00:23:29.615
If being warm is so good for you,

00:23:30.485 --> 00:23:32.055
we should not just be holding hands.

00:23:35.495 --> 00:23:37.695
Maybe we should try something else.

00:23:40.295 --> 00:23:42.495
I was already planning on it.

00:23:43.165 --> 00:23:45.735
Close your eyes. You might be surprised.

00:23:47.765 --> 00:23:50.135
What? I have to close my eyes?

00:23:52.945 --> 00:23:55.575
Fine. Do whatever you want.

00:23:55.845 --> 00:23:56.845
All right.

00:24:04.415 --> 00:24:06.325
Just trust the best healer from Boryeong.

00:24:06.725 --> 00:24:07.725
What?

00:24:20.905 --> 00:24:21.905
No, do not.

00:24:44.895 --> 00:24:46.725
There we go.

00:24:47.225 --> 00:24:49.565
- You are doing great. - No!

00:24:50.495 --> 00:24:51.595
Did you call for me?

00:24:55.235 --> 00:24:56.305
I did not.

00:24:57.075 --> 00:25:02.045
But just now, I heard "Se Dol."

00:25:05.645 --> 00:25:07.185
Were you not the one who called me?

00:25:07.245 --> 00:25:09.715
I said I did not. Now go get me a wet towel.

00:25:11.385 --> 00:25:14.155
Why am I always the one to see this? This is so frustrating.

00:25:36.045 --> 00:25:39.145
Your Royal Highness. Are you still pouting?

00:25:39.885 --> 00:25:40.945
I am not pouting.

00:25:41.485 --> 00:25:43.355
You certainly sound like you are.

00:25:43.885 --> 00:25:45.215
I said I am not.

00:25:46.625 --> 00:25:49.195
Okay. I am sorry for teasing you.

00:25:49.755 --> 00:25:52.665
I have apologized. Come here so we can clean your hand.

00:25:55.165 --> 00:25:56.864
Hey, what are you doing?

00:25:56.865 --> 00:25:58.235
Why are you dunking your hands when they are hurt?

00:25:58.295 --> 00:26:00.165
It will get infected. Gosh.

00:26:24.095 --> 00:26:28.125
Goodness.

00:26:30.195 --> 00:26:34.405
I have been eating well and on time, so I cannot be collapsing already.

00:26:38.735 --> 00:26:39.745
What?

00:26:47.845 --> 00:26:49.684
- Oh, no. What is going on? - Calm down.

00:26:49.685 --> 00:26:51.514
- Did we switch bodies again? - My body... Why is it over there?

00:26:51.515 --> 00:26:52.555
What do we do?

00:26:52.885 --> 00:26:54.485
- Your Royal Highness. - Your Royal Highness.

00:27:00.195 --> 00:27:04.695
- Who do I look like to you? - Tell me who you see right now.

00:27:07.205 --> 00:27:08.235
Well...

00:27:08.835 --> 00:27:10.634
Your Highness and the Royal Concubine...

00:27:10.635 --> 00:27:11.735
Darn! So...

00:27:12.035 --> 00:27:16.475
So you are saying you see me as Dal, and you see her as me?

00:27:19.745 --> 00:27:20.885
What in the...

00:27:20.945 --> 00:27:25.625
Oh, come on. Not this "I am you, you are me" stuff.

00:27:25.685 --> 00:27:26.955
There you go, playing your games again.

00:27:27.385 --> 00:27:29.795
Is this your first time dating or something?

00:27:30.125 --> 00:27:31.855
Why are you making such a fuss?

00:27:33.165 --> 00:27:34.565
Are you trying to make fun of this lonely old eunuch?

00:27:34.625 --> 00:27:36.065
Lonely eunuch? What nonsense.

00:27:36.135 --> 00:27:38.365
Well, then, we will let you two enjoy yourselves.

00:27:41.635 --> 00:27:44.005
My lady, the Left State Councilor has come for you.

00:27:54.915 --> 00:27:57.115
Left State Councilor, what brings you all the way here?

00:27:57.355 --> 00:27:59.985
Last night, you took...

00:28:00.885 --> 00:28:04.955
the Jimjo chick from the prison to lure its mother.

00:28:05.025 --> 00:28:06.525
We have received this testimony.

00:28:07.295 --> 00:28:09.595
You will have to come with us for questioning.

00:28:09.765 --> 00:28:11.734
As I recall, the Royal Concubine is under...

00:28:11.735 --> 00:28:12.965
the Crown Prince's Palace's authority.

00:28:13.305 --> 00:28:14.965
By what authority do you presume to take her?

00:28:15.505 --> 00:28:17.505
The fate of the nation is at stake.

00:28:18.205 --> 00:28:20.005
Please grant us your permission, Your Royal Highness.

00:28:20.545 --> 00:28:23.475
I have nothing to be ashamed of, so of course I will go.

00:28:24.515 --> 00:28:25.515
Let us go.

00:28:29.255 --> 00:28:31.985
I will be back soon, so please do not worry.

00:28:40.625 --> 00:28:44.665
How did you know of the Secret Prison and the Jimjo chick?

00:28:45.135 --> 00:28:48.035
The former Chief Court Lady tried to force an infertility drug on me.

00:28:48.105 --> 00:28:50.075
She had me abducted and taken to the Secret Prison.

00:28:50.375 --> 00:28:51.605
That is when I found out.

00:28:52.245 --> 00:28:55.145
About both the Secret Prison and the Jimjo chick.

00:28:56.315 --> 00:28:59.915
If you do not believe me, ask the Queen Dowager yourself.

00:29:01.915 --> 00:29:05.115
By the way, I wonder if the Queen Dowager...

00:29:05.585 --> 00:29:08.855
has heard the rumors circulating about the Jimjo Poison.

00:29:09.555 --> 00:29:11.855
She is using the Queen Dowager's backing...

00:29:12.495 --> 00:29:15.095
to dig into the Gyesa Year Incident?

00:29:16.035 --> 00:29:17.035
Then,

00:29:17.795 --> 00:29:21.805
why did you lure the mother with its young?

00:29:22.105 --> 00:29:25.505
As rumors of the Jimjo are causing unrest among the people,

00:29:25.645 --> 00:29:30.445
is it not wise to catch the creature and expose who is behind this?

00:29:30.915 --> 00:29:34.385
Is that not why you are investigating me now?

00:29:35.445 --> 00:29:37.415
To find the master of the Jimjo...

00:29:38.285 --> 00:29:40.255
who might just be a traitor.

00:29:49.795 --> 00:29:52.305
Thank you for indulging my discourtesy.

00:29:52.965 --> 00:29:53.965
Thanks to you,

00:29:54.365 --> 00:29:57.135
I now have a new lead, the former Chief Court Lady.

00:29:58.135 --> 00:30:00.345
I will now begin my investigation.

00:30:02.245 --> 00:30:05.315
How do you intend to investigate someone who is already dead?

00:30:05.645 --> 00:30:07.785
She must have had an accomplice.

00:30:08.485 --> 00:30:11.355
The mastermind behind it all,

00:30:12.355 --> 00:30:13.485
who could very well be a traitor.

00:30:19.225 --> 00:30:20.265
Good grief.

00:30:26.365 --> 00:30:28.805
How did it go? Are you all right?

00:30:29.275 --> 00:30:31.305
The Left State Councilor is doing just what I wanted.

00:30:31.875 --> 00:30:33.405
He said he is going to investigate the Chief Court Lady.

00:30:35.875 --> 00:30:39.115
Am I supposed to be glad that our bodies switched?

00:30:39.345 --> 00:30:40.415
Glad?

00:30:40.685 --> 00:30:42.215
How could swapping bodies possibly be a good thing?

00:30:42.885 --> 00:30:44.055
Why did we have to swap again?

00:30:51.195 --> 00:30:52.665
And I am stuck in these uncomfortable clothes again.

00:30:53.295 --> 00:30:55.835
- What good are these legs... - River.

00:30:55.895 --> 00:30:56.895
If I cannot even use them properly?

00:30:56.896 --> 00:30:57.935
Rain.

00:31:02.105 --> 00:31:03.105
A basin?

00:31:10.675 --> 00:31:11.745
Our bodies...

00:31:13.745 --> 00:31:15.145
I am back in my own body.

00:31:17.485 --> 00:31:18.855
I think water has something to do with it.

00:31:22.285 --> 00:31:24.154
Why did we swap bodies again?

00:31:24.155 --> 00:31:26.395
You are too loud, so please be quiet. I am trying to think.

00:31:27.095 --> 00:31:29.565
Dal. If you were in my shoes, could you possibly be quiet?

00:31:30.435 --> 00:31:34.035
We kissed once, and we switched. We slept embraced for one night,

00:31:34.105 --> 00:31:35.405
and the next day, we swapped.

00:31:36.005 --> 00:31:37.205
I am a healthy man, you know!

00:31:39.845 --> 00:31:40.975
What was with you?

00:31:41.705 --> 00:31:44.345
This really stings. You were not fine at all.

00:31:46.785 --> 00:31:47.785
Blood?

00:32:09.375 --> 00:32:11.005
What is wrong?

00:32:16.945 --> 00:32:18.075
What are you doing now?

00:32:18.975 --> 00:32:20.385
Hold on.

00:32:31.855 --> 00:32:32.895
Dal.

00:32:33.325 --> 00:32:34.325
It is okay.

00:33:15.605 --> 00:33:18.005
What? Am I back?

00:33:25.775 --> 00:33:27.045
You are so adorable!

00:33:28.645 --> 00:33:31.215
See? It was blood and water.

00:33:31.885 --> 00:33:34.125
You and I both get a cut,

00:33:34.385 --> 00:33:36.354
and it gets washed with water.

00:33:36.355 --> 00:33:38.495
Ta-da! That is how we switch bodies.

00:33:39.895 --> 00:33:42.635
You silly girl. Why clap with your cut hand?

00:33:42.695 --> 00:33:45.495
I am just so happy! We finally know how to switch bodies.

00:33:45.565 --> 00:33:46.835
Are you not happy too?

00:33:47.905 --> 00:33:49.005
Hey.

00:33:50.575 --> 00:33:52.745
Your hand. That must hurt.

00:33:58.375 --> 00:34:01.415
Really, it is nothing.

00:34:02.085 --> 00:34:03.385
It is not a big deal.

00:34:03.785 --> 00:34:06.085
How is it not a big deal? Of course it is.

00:34:08.125 --> 00:34:10.225
Think about it.

00:34:11.055 --> 00:34:12.625
If you get hurt like this,

00:34:13.195 --> 00:34:15.095
I will spend all day worrying about you,

00:34:15.565 --> 00:34:16.565
and if I am worrying about you,

00:34:16.635 --> 00:34:18.365
I will not be able to focus on my royal duties,

00:34:18.635 --> 00:34:21.435
and if that happens, the nation will fall into ruin.

00:34:22.035 --> 00:34:23.735
Is that what you want? To see the nation fall?

00:34:24.035 --> 00:34:28.475
Do you want to rewrite history or something?

00:34:29.245 --> 00:34:31.315
Gosh, these lovely fingers...

00:34:41.385 --> 00:34:44.895
I hear you were neighbors who were close to Park Dal.

00:34:45.655 --> 00:34:48.295
Go to Hanyang and say exactly what I tell you.

00:34:48.625 --> 00:34:50.035
Do that, and no harm will come to you.

00:35:07.845 --> 00:35:09.284
I...

00:35:09.285 --> 00:35:11.355
I really do not know anything.

00:35:13.425 --> 00:35:14.525
I swear.

00:35:16.855 --> 00:35:18.395
You will have to know.

00:35:18.895 --> 00:35:19.965
Also,

00:35:20.365 --> 00:35:22.665
you will have to do exactly as I say.

00:35:24.395 --> 00:35:26.365
That is the only way the Chief Royal Secretary will live.

00:35:31.035 --> 00:35:34.605
Last night, the niece of the former Chief Court Lady Jo...

00:35:34.675 --> 00:35:36.915
confessed to releasing the Jimjo.

00:35:37.515 --> 00:35:40.885
In the Mount Inwang Cave, connected to Jo's brewery,

00:35:40.945 --> 00:35:42.785
they supposedly raised the Jimjo.

00:35:43.315 --> 00:35:45.655
Have you inspected the cave?

00:35:45.915 --> 00:35:47.685
It was blown up and is now blocked,

00:35:48.225 --> 00:35:50.895
but we discovered a tunnel that runs from the brewery...

00:35:50.955 --> 00:35:53.925
to the foot of Mount Inwang.

00:35:54.495 --> 00:35:55.495
So you are saying...

00:35:55.496 --> 00:35:58.235
the Chief Court Lady was the one behind the Jimjo?

00:35:59.095 --> 00:36:00.335
It would appear so.

00:36:02.675 --> 00:36:03.675
Then...

00:36:03.975 --> 00:36:06.205
let us conclude the Jimjo case...

00:36:06.275 --> 00:36:08.475
and resume the Royal Wedding, Your Highness.

00:36:08.545 --> 00:36:09.715
Not yet.

00:36:12.575 --> 00:36:15.315
She may have been plotting treason.

00:36:15.785 --> 00:36:17.585
A thorough investigation is required,

00:36:18.385 --> 00:36:19.455
so please grant me...

00:36:20.155 --> 00:36:22.055
a little more time.

00:36:22.855 --> 00:36:23.955
Left State Councilor.

00:36:24.495 --> 00:36:25.525
Left State Councilor.

00:36:29.635 --> 00:36:31.135
Do as you see fit, Left State Councilor.

00:36:35.465 --> 00:36:37.605
The Left State Councilor is stalling for time.

00:36:37.735 --> 00:36:39.135
I wonder what he is up to.

00:36:39.545 --> 00:36:41.275
Have you found the body of the man in the Choraengi Mask?

00:36:41.475 --> 00:36:43.915
They still have not cleared the cave entrance.

00:36:44.315 --> 00:36:46.145
It seems it will take more time.

00:36:47.045 --> 00:36:49.955
That might be for the best. We need more time anyway.

00:36:49.985 --> 00:36:52.455
Do not worry, Your Royal Highness. Just as you intended,

00:36:52.515 --> 00:36:53.885
everything is going according to plan.

00:36:54.285 --> 00:36:56.595
Right. I am just worrying for nothing.

00:36:56.825 --> 00:36:57.995
Your Royal Highness.

00:36:59.055 --> 00:37:00.525
It is I, Cha Eun Woo.

00:37:02.695 --> 00:37:04.664
As you commanded, Your Highness,

00:37:04.665 --> 00:37:06.965
I have tasked Joseon's finest artisan.

00:37:07.035 --> 00:37:09.305
I am certain you will be pleased with the result.

00:37:11.405 --> 00:37:12.605
Excellent.

00:37:13.605 --> 00:37:17.345
It is made exactly like the drawing I did that day. Right?

00:37:26.925 --> 00:37:30.095
Why the simple white robe, all of a sudden?

00:37:30.455 --> 00:37:34.465
For the same reason you are wearing a green top and a red skirt.

00:37:35.225 --> 00:37:36.965
I was just about to ask about that.

00:37:37.265 --> 00:37:41.065
Why this outfit all of a sudden? Is this a "personal color analysis"?

00:37:41.705 --> 00:37:43.175
- No. - Then what?

00:37:43.535 --> 00:37:45.304
Why did you insist I had to wear this...

00:37:45.305 --> 00:37:46.405
and make such a big deal about it?

00:37:48.605 --> 00:37:49.775
It is a bribe.

00:37:51.715 --> 00:37:52.985
I need to...

00:37:54.685 --> 00:37:56.155
ask your permission for something.

00:37:56.315 --> 00:37:58.055
What are you trying to say?

00:37:58.385 --> 00:37:59.885
A bribe, and now you need my permission?

00:38:05.225 --> 00:38:06.265
My lord.

00:38:12.465 --> 00:38:13.665
What?

00:38:16.535 --> 00:38:17.835
What is all this?

00:38:32.855 --> 00:38:34.455
What is all of this?

00:38:49.605 --> 00:38:52.775
Other than straw shoes, I want one in flower shoes.

00:38:53.475 --> 00:38:54.745
But a life where I wear flower shoes...

00:38:55.375 --> 00:38:56.775
and walk at a leisurely pace.

00:38:57.745 --> 00:38:58.775
That is the life I want.

00:39:00.145 --> 00:39:02.915
Flower shoes? I will buy you over a hundred pairs of them.

00:39:03.085 --> 00:39:06.015
I will buy you enough to fill an entire room.

00:40:26.095 --> 00:40:28.905
Why is this one all by itself in the middle?

00:40:32.475 --> 00:40:33.675
Inside your dream,

00:40:34.675 --> 00:40:36.075
I have placed my own.

00:41:02.835 --> 00:41:04.105
Is this a bribe too?

00:41:06.205 --> 00:41:07.205
Well,

00:41:08.045 --> 00:41:09.305
this is not a bribe.

00:41:12.815 --> 00:41:13.885
It is a wedding gift.

00:41:37.035 --> 00:41:39.405
Right now, I am...

00:41:44.745 --> 00:41:47.145
proposing to you.

00:41:56.025 --> 00:41:57.295
Not as the Crown Prince,

00:42:00.165 --> 00:42:01.295
but as a man,

00:42:02.795 --> 00:42:04.695
I am asking the woman I love...

00:42:06.195 --> 00:42:07.265
to be my one...

00:42:08.465 --> 00:42:09.805
and only partner.

00:42:12.875 --> 00:42:14.375
I am asking for your hand.

00:42:17.415 --> 00:42:18.415
Will you...

00:42:23.455 --> 00:42:25.255
be my wife?

00:42:58.515 --> 00:43:01.025
As Lee Gang and Park Dal wish to become husband and wife,

00:43:01.955 --> 00:43:03.825
we declare it before all the deities of the skies and earth.

00:43:05.195 --> 00:43:07.965
Please watch over this precious bond...

00:43:08.765 --> 00:43:10.295
and help us to protect it.

00:47:59.915 --> 00:48:03.185
Indeed. If she fails to find herself,

00:48:03.495 --> 00:48:05.895
then both this flower of fate and red thread of fate...

00:48:06.255 --> 00:48:08.665
will remain forever incomplete.

00:48:30.255 --> 00:48:31.455
Are you that happy?

00:48:31.855 --> 00:48:34.225
Gosh, you are awake?

00:48:40.265 --> 00:48:41.865
With you touching my face like this,

00:48:42.565 --> 00:48:45.795
- how could I possibly stay asleep? - It is just that...

00:48:47.805 --> 00:48:49.005
I understand, though.

00:48:49.535 --> 00:48:50.835
It must be hard to believe.

00:48:52.005 --> 00:48:55.875
That the Crown Prince of this nation is completely and utterly yours.

00:48:56.775 --> 00:48:58.045
Your heart must be bursting.

00:48:59.615 --> 00:49:00.645
I get it.

00:49:01.785 --> 00:49:02.885
It is all right.

00:49:14.395 --> 00:49:15.495
What is wrong?

00:49:18.935 --> 00:49:22.465
Can I just step outside the palace for a bit?

00:49:22.965 --> 00:49:23.975
Where to?

00:49:25.235 --> 00:49:26.235
So, let me get this straight.

00:49:26.605 --> 00:49:28.745
First you were a eunuch, then a court lady,

00:49:29.005 --> 00:49:33.075
then the Crown Prince, and now you are his concubine?

00:49:36.245 --> 00:49:37.755
I do not even know anymore.

00:49:38.185 --> 00:49:40.115
Every time I blink, something changes.

00:49:40.455 --> 00:49:41.955
My head is about to explode.

00:49:42.785 --> 00:49:43.795
Your Highness.

00:49:44.125 --> 00:49:46.795
From now on, you must mind your words and deeds.

00:49:46.925 --> 00:49:49.425
Mom, why are you talking so formally all of a sudden?

00:49:49.595 --> 00:49:52.365
What is this? Are you already trying to suck up to her?

00:49:53.765 --> 00:49:57.505
Are you trying to win her over alone now that she is a royal concubine?

00:49:59.005 --> 00:50:00.005
My gosh.

00:50:01.445 --> 00:50:02.445
Your Highness.

00:50:02.905 --> 00:50:06.215
The sun is quite harsh. Please, do come inside.

00:50:06.275 --> 00:50:08.215
Dad! Not you too!

00:50:08.715 --> 00:50:10.815
Auntie, can you please do something about Mom and Dad?

00:50:12.985 --> 00:50:14.085
Let us just go inside for now.

00:50:16.995 --> 00:50:17.995
Unbelievable.

00:50:19.495 --> 00:50:20.495
Dal.

00:50:21.225 --> 00:50:22.225
No.

00:50:22.925 --> 00:50:26.495
I need to speak with the Royal Concubine alone.

00:50:27.105 --> 00:50:28.505
- All right, my lady. - All right, my lady.

00:50:40.145 --> 00:50:42.514
Did you do something wrong? Why the bowed head?

00:50:42.515 --> 00:50:44.615
Because I did not listen to you,

00:50:46.215 --> 00:50:47.525
I have ended up here.

00:50:50.525 --> 00:50:52.855
If you have taken the wrong path, you can always just get off it.

00:50:57.865 --> 00:51:00.965
I will create an opportunity soon. Let us leave for Qing.

00:51:02.135 --> 00:51:03.135
I am sorry.

00:51:04.735 --> 00:51:05.735
Last night,

00:51:06.575 --> 00:51:08.575
I spent my wedding night with His Royal Highness.

00:51:09.705 --> 00:51:11.815
Now, I am going to stay by His Royal Highness's side,

00:51:12.615 --> 00:51:14.385
by my husband's side.

00:51:16.315 --> 00:51:19.255
You mean you formed a marital bond with the Crown Prince?

00:51:21.255 --> 00:51:22.255
Yes.

00:51:23.825 --> 00:51:24.825
So,

00:51:25.225 --> 00:51:27.625
you should take my parents and leave Hanyang now.

00:51:28.125 --> 00:51:31.035
You could be in danger if the Left State Councilor sees you.

00:51:32.165 --> 00:51:34.135
That is what I came here to tell you today.

00:51:39.375 --> 00:51:40.405
What?

00:51:40.775 --> 00:51:43.845
Being the Crown Prince's concubine is a good thing, is it not?

00:51:44.475 --> 00:51:45.875
Why the long face?

00:51:46.145 --> 00:51:47.214
He is right.

00:51:47.215 --> 00:51:50.045
A slave who fled Hanyang is now a Royal Concubine.

00:51:50.285 --> 00:51:52.315
What could be better than this?

00:51:52.615 --> 00:51:54.185
We do not have to be on the run anymore.

00:51:54.485 --> 00:51:57.195
Goodness, I can finally sleep well at night.

00:51:57.395 --> 00:51:58.395
Dal...

00:51:59.625 --> 00:52:01.595
should not be in the palace.

00:52:03.635 --> 00:52:06.865
So, what is that supposed to mean?

00:52:09.505 --> 00:52:10.805
Excuse me for a moment.

00:52:10.875 --> 00:52:12.905
Hey, where are you going? We are in the middle of talking.

00:52:14.075 --> 00:52:17.375
(Eunwol Pavilion)

00:52:21.515 --> 00:52:23.714
I asked to meet the Head Eunuch ages ago.

00:52:23.715 --> 00:52:25.415
Why have I not heard back?

00:52:25.855 --> 00:52:27.285
Did you even send the message?

00:52:27.785 --> 00:52:30.325
I did. Several times.

00:52:30.755 --> 00:52:32.625
But what can I do if there is no reply?

00:52:33.325 --> 00:52:34.325
That is why...

00:52:34.565 --> 00:52:36.525
I told you to just give me the message.

00:52:39.935 --> 00:52:40.965
Gang.

00:52:43.705 --> 00:52:44.775
Yeon Wol.

00:52:47.705 --> 00:52:49.345
Tell him Hong Nan of Eunwol Pavilion...

00:52:50.615 --> 00:52:52.575
is in Hanyang with Gang Yeon Wol.

00:52:53.785 --> 00:52:54.785
Pass on that message.

00:53:00.055 --> 00:53:03.325
The Jimjo's cave on Mount Inwang is connected to Jo's brewery.

00:53:03.625 --> 00:53:06.825
Find proof the Left State Councilor sold the brewery to this man.

00:53:09.595 --> 00:53:13.565
This house looks abandoned. Are you sure this is the place?

00:53:14.565 --> 00:53:16.605
According to this deed,

00:53:16.665 --> 00:53:19.575
the one who sold the brewery to the former Chief Court Lady lived here.

00:53:20.375 --> 00:53:21.375
What is this?

00:53:21.675 --> 00:53:23.875
What are you doing at an abandoned house?

00:53:25.375 --> 00:53:27.985
How long has this house been empty?

00:53:28.785 --> 00:53:30.955
About 5 or 6 years, I think?

00:53:31.315 --> 00:53:33.154
Where did they go?

00:53:33.155 --> 00:53:35.525
No idea. They skipped town at night.

00:53:37.595 --> 00:53:38.725
Skipped town at night?

00:53:40.925 --> 00:53:44.735
Of course. The Left State Councilor would not just let a key person go.

00:53:46.565 --> 00:53:49.065
Here is the requested autopsy report on the snake hunter murder case.

00:53:50.875 --> 00:53:53.674
What is the point of collecting more evidence on Jimjo poison?

00:53:53.675 --> 00:53:55.075
We do not have a smoking gun.

00:53:56.945 --> 00:53:58.775
But we must do something in the meantime.

00:54:18.695 --> 00:54:19.735
What is it?

00:54:26.105 --> 00:54:29.345
The location of the swollen red dot on each body...

00:54:31.345 --> 00:54:33.515
The Fengfu point. The Philtrum point.

00:54:33.985 --> 00:54:34.985
The Tiantu point.

00:54:36.185 --> 00:54:37.285
They are all vital points.

00:54:38.415 --> 00:54:39.685
If they are red dots,

00:54:40.255 --> 00:54:42.155
does that mean acupuncture was performed?

00:54:42.585 --> 00:54:43.925
Not by the Chief Court Lady...

00:54:44.655 --> 00:54:46.395
but another person in the palace could have.

00:54:47.925 --> 00:54:50.565
Someone who can perform acupuncture on vital points.

00:54:51.195 --> 00:54:52.195
A female Royal Physician.

00:54:52.895 --> 00:54:55.265
Choraengi Mask, who set off the bomb in the Jimjo cave that day,

00:54:56.305 --> 00:54:58.535
seemed to know their way around that cave.

00:54:59.635 --> 00:55:01.375
That means it was not their first or second time there.

00:55:04.875 --> 00:55:07.615
Let us go. I must see for myself.

00:55:12.555 --> 00:55:16.025
None of our female Royal Physicians have died recently. Why do you ask?

00:55:16.525 --> 00:55:19.295
Have any of the female physicians suddenly disappeared?

00:55:23.125 --> 00:55:26.795
Well, one left due to illness a few days ago, but...

00:55:27.665 --> 00:55:30.905
You know how the Jimjo appeared in the palace a while ago?

00:55:31.205 --> 00:55:33.075
She left the very next day.

00:55:33.435 --> 00:55:34.775
Did you see her in person?

00:55:35.205 --> 00:55:39.415
She said it was contagious, so she sent someone instead.

00:55:45.285 --> 00:55:46.585
Bring me her records.

00:55:50.255 --> 00:55:51.355
Drink up.

00:55:52.025 --> 00:55:54.425
- Here, drink up. - So, why are you...

00:55:54.665 --> 00:55:58.364
so curious about the owner of that empty house?

00:55:58.365 --> 00:55:59.535
You see,

00:55:59.935 --> 00:56:02.964
she ran off with my money.

00:56:02.965 --> 00:56:04.905
That rotten scoundrel.

00:56:06.205 --> 00:56:08.375
Looks like my lord just wasted his money on drinks.

00:56:08.975 --> 00:56:11.945
How do you expect to catch a slave who was determined to run away?

00:56:13.015 --> 00:56:14.015
A slave?

00:56:14.085 --> 00:56:17.685
What? You lent her the money without even knowing that?

00:56:18.015 --> 00:56:21.825
If an out-resident slave means to deceive you, you stand no chance.

00:56:22.285 --> 00:56:23.285
Just give up.

00:56:23.725 --> 00:56:26.695
He is a slave who escaped from the great Left State Councilor himself.

00:56:26.995 --> 00:56:28.225
How could you possibly hope to catch them?

00:56:28.525 --> 00:56:29.995
Wait, the Left State Councilor?

00:56:32.065 --> 00:56:33.435
The owner of that empty house...

00:56:33.905 --> 00:56:36.135
is an out-resident slave from the Left State Councilor's household?

00:56:37.835 --> 00:56:40.375
Summon the royal guards at once, and send word to Je Un.

00:56:40.435 --> 00:56:42.245
We must find the body in the Mount Inwang Cave.

00:56:42.305 --> 00:56:44.445
- Yes, Your Highness. - That might not be necessary.

00:56:44.515 --> 00:56:45.515
Gang.

00:56:45.945 --> 00:56:48.114
Good. I was about to send for you.

00:56:48.115 --> 00:56:49.785
I have identified the Choraengi Mask.

00:56:50.615 --> 00:56:52.185
We have to find the body in the cave.

00:56:52.515 --> 00:56:54.024
The Choraengi Mask's identity?

00:56:54.025 --> 00:56:55.525
But did you not say it was the Chief Court Lady?

00:56:55.625 --> 00:56:57.555
She was a Royal Physician named Kim Deok Chun.

00:56:58.255 --> 00:57:01.025
Before the Left State Councilor frames the Chief Cour Lady's niece,

00:57:01.225 --> 00:57:02.495
we have to find her body.

00:57:02.565 --> 00:57:05.295
But what is her connection to the Left State Councilor?

00:57:05.395 --> 00:57:06.795
I found out the physician's mother...

00:57:08.205 --> 00:57:10.265
was an out-resident slave for the Left State Councilor.

00:57:11.675 --> 00:57:14.905
Could her name be Yun Gye Sim?

00:57:15.805 --> 00:57:17.045
How would you know about that?

00:57:17.575 --> 00:57:21.145
She is the one who sold the brewery to the former Chief Court Lady.

00:57:43.605 --> 00:57:45.275
- Let us go. - Yes, Your Highness.

00:57:53.115 --> 00:57:55.285
All right. Thank you for your hard work.

00:58:03.955 --> 00:58:06.755
The body of the Choraengi Mask must be somewhere here.

00:58:07.295 --> 00:58:09.465
- Find the body. - Yes, Your Highness.

00:58:17.405 --> 00:58:19.075
They are the Royal Concubine's neighbors from Boryeong.

00:58:22.705 --> 00:58:24.075
Prepare my official robes.

00:58:24.975 --> 00:58:26.215
I must go to the palace.

00:58:27.585 --> 00:58:30.855
It seems His Royal Highness has, for quite some time,

00:58:30.985 --> 00:58:33.085
been consumed by revenge.

00:58:34.825 --> 00:58:37.255
He was digging into the Gyesa Year Incident.

00:58:38.125 --> 00:58:40.625
I intend to ensure this ends with the Chief Court Lady,

00:58:40.995 --> 00:58:43.325
but thanks to His Royal Highness escalating the matter,

00:58:44.935 --> 00:58:49.135
it seems we will need another offering.

00:58:50.205 --> 00:58:51.335
An offering?

00:58:52.705 --> 00:58:53.905
The Royal Concubine...

00:58:54.505 --> 00:58:55.575
The Royal Concubine?

00:58:55.745 --> 00:59:00.815
Many people witnessed her using the Jimjo chick to lure its mother.

00:59:15.865 --> 00:59:17.395
How could you try to take everything...

00:59:18.735 --> 00:59:20.535
from the Crown Prince?

00:59:24.175 --> 00:59:25.235
Your Majesty.

00:59:25.405 --> 00:59:28.405
Is it not a stretch to say the Royal Concubine masterminded the omen?

00:59:29.505 --> 00:59:31.445
She would have no motive to do such a thing.

00:59:36.515 --> 00:59:39.855
The Royal Concubine has no motive,

00:59:42.855 --> 00:59:47.055
but the deposed Crown Princess certainly does.

00:59:54.605 --> 00:59:56.964
Do you know how the Royal Concubine...

00:59:56.965 --> 00:59:58.835
won the Queen Dowager's favor?

01:00:01.905 --> 01:00:04.175
I have heard rumors she resembles the deposed Crown Princess,

01:00:04.975 --> 01:00:07.615
but who would believe such a tale?

01:00:09.445 --> 01:00:10.685
Do not worry.

01:00:11.455 --> 01:00:15.925
I have paid witnesses who will claim she is the deposed Crown Princess.

01:00:34.775 --> 01:00:37.005
What have you been so lost in thought about?

01:00:43.685 --> 01:00:44.685
Yeon Sim.

01:00:45.855 --> 01:00:49.925
About the late Queen. The Crown Prince's mother.

01:00:51.155 --> 01:00:55.425
Did she die from drinking poisoned tea?

01:00:56.525 --> 01:00:57.535
Yes.

01:00:59.195 --> 01:01:01.735
They say that is why the Crown Princess was deposed.

01:01:02.105 --> 01:01:03.665
For poisoning the Queen.

01:01:04.335 --> 01:01:05.505
The Crown Princess?

01:01:06.435 --> 01:01:07.475
Royal Mother.

01:01:09.005 --> 01:01:10.275
Royal Mother.

01:01:12.045 --> 01:01:13.145
What was the evidence?

01:01:13.275 --> 01:01:17.385
They said poison was found somewhere in her quarters.

01:01:18.255 --> 01:01:21.485
Was it her drawer? Or her bedding?

01:01:22.185 --> 01:01:23.185
A pillow?

01:01:23.755 --> 01:01:26.395
Yes. That is right. It was inside her pillow.

01:01:28.025 --> 01:01:29.925
Why ask if you already know everything?

01:01:34.405 --> 01:01:36.764
- You are right. - Royal Concubine,

01:01:36.765 --> 01:01:38.335
come forth and receive the Royal Order!

01:01:39.105 --> 01:01:41.275
Why on earth are you taking her to the Royal Investigation Office?

01:01:41.505 --> 01:01:44.975
Testimony says she is the mastermind of the Jimjo incident.

01:01:45.175 --> 01:01:47.715
- That is completely absurd! - It is a Royal Order.

01:01:48.085 --> 01:01:49.745
You must come with us.

01:01:51.415 --> 01:01:52.415
Your Highness.

01:01:55.125 --> 01:01:56.225
Go tell the Crown Prince.

01:01:57.825 --> 01:01:58.825
Hurry.

01:02:11.535 --> 01:02:12.535
Your Royal Highness.

01:02:13.275 --> 01:02:16.005
Well, did you find anything?

01:02:16.345 --> 01:02:18.345
We have searched everywhere, but there is no body.

01:02:18.415 --> 01:02:22.045
Could she have been fast enough to escape through the entrance?

01:02:22.115 --> 01:02:24.885
The bomb went off while she was still inside the cave.

01:02:25.155 --> 01:02:28.355
No matter how fast they are, at most they have gone is around 3m.

01:02:29.555 --> 01:02:33.455
Then what? Did she grow wings? Or disappear into the earth?

01:02:34.055 --> 01:02:35.065
Gosh.

01:02:35.765 --> 01:02:37.265
Around 3m?

01:02:44.205 --> 01:02:46.435
There! Get them!

01:02:57.615 --> 01:02:58.755
What is it?

01:03:01.225 --> 01:03:04.055
If she did not fly up to the sky or disappear into the ground,

01:03:05.155 --> 01:03:06.295
she must have escaped.

01:03:07.195 --> 01:03:08.865
There must be a hidden passage.

01:03:09.395 --> 01:03:10.795
Find that passage.

01:03:15.865 --> 01:03:16.935
My lady!

01:03:17.975 --> 01:03:20.705
- Where is His Royal Highness now? - I do not know either.

01:03:21.045 --> 01:03:22.775
For this to happen to the Royal Concubine, of all times...

01:05:02.675 --> 01:05:06.345
I knew it. The Choraengi Mask is alive.

01:05:16.025 --> 01:05:18.855
It is harder than you would think, choosing where you belong.

01:05:20.855 --> 01:05:22.795
The Crown Prince is looking for your mother.

01:05:23.525 --> 01:05:25.835
It is only a matter of time before they find out who you are.

01:05:28.335 --> 01:05:29.365
You must leave.

01:05:30.765 --> 01:05:32.335
Do not worry about your mother.

01:05:46.785 --> 01:05:50.325
It seems this is the first time you are seeing her, Your Majesty.

01:05:50.755 --> 01:05:53.094
She resembles the deposed Crown Princess,

01:05:53.095 --> 01:05:55.425
but this is the Royal Concubine, Park Dal.

01:05:57.935 --> 01:06:00.495
The niece of the former Chief Court Lady Jo...

01:06:02.405 --> 01:06:05.005
has identified you as the mastermind behind the Jimjo incident.

01:06:07.005 --> 01:06:09.345
- Will you confess? - Your Majesty.

01:06:10.175 --> 01:06:13.445
How could I be the mastermind of the Jimjo incident?

01:06:14.375 --> 01:06:16.545
I have no reason to do such a thing.

01:06:17.515 --> 01:06:21.385
She said she had to avenge what happened five years ago...

01:06:23.555 --> 01:06:27.025
- and to free the Jimjo Birds. - What in the world?

01:06:28.065 --> 01:06:30.465
I truly do not understand why you are doing this to me.

01:06:31.595 --> 01:06:35.105
Your Majesty, I was not in the palace five years ago.

01:06:35.205 --> 01:06:38.075
So what could I be avenging?

01:06:38.505 --> 01:06:39.735
That is because the Royal Concubine...

01:06:41.445 --> 01:06:42.805
is the supposedly deceased...

01:06:50.245 --> 01:06:51.755
Crown Princess Gang.

01:06:53.755 --> 01:06:56.385
I am... Who?

01:07:12.605 --> 01:07:13.635
Search every inch of this place.

01:07:28.255 --> 01:07:29.255
Your Majesty.

01:07:29.885 --> 01:07:31.695
There is another witness.

01:07:35.895 --> 01:07:38.035
You two? How are you here?

01:07:38.295 --> 01:07:42.505
Your Majesty, Park Dal is not Lord Hong's wife's niece.

01:07:43.235 --> 01:07:45.334
Five years ago in winter,

01:07:45.335 --> 01:07:48.275
a family from Hanyang arrived suddenly.

01:07:49.075 --> 01:07:50.675
Five years ago? What are you talking about?

01:07:51.145 --> 01:07:53.414
Why are you lying too?

01:07:53.415 --> 01:07:55.685
I have lived in Boryeong since age five!

01:07:55.885 --> 01:07:58.885
If you want to know about the lies, go ask your parents.

01:07:59.285 --> 01:08:01.155
I am seriously going to lose my mind.

01:08:02.525 --> 01:08:04.285
She has the same face as the deposed Crown Princess.

01:08:04.625 --> 01:08:06.325
The winter the deposed Crown Princess vanished...

01:08:06.795 --> 01:08:08.965
is when she suddenly appeared in Boryeong.

01:08:11.065 --> 01:08:13.865
Do you truly believe that is a coincidence?

01:08:15.965 --> 01:08:16.965
Your Majesty.

01:08:17.605 --> 01:08:19.805
Please deliver your verdict.

01:08:27.315 --> 01:08:28.445
Your Majesty.

01:08:33.315 --> 01:08:35.625
If the Royal Concubine is the Deposed Crown Princess Gang,

01:08:37.425 --> 01:08:40.095
then she is a traitor who fled, defying a Royal Order.

01:08:41.825 --> 01:08:43.395
The rightful punishment is beheading.

01:08:46.665 --> 01:08:47.895
Proceed with the interrogation.

01:08:48.665 --> 01:08:49.865
- Yes, Your Majesty. - Yes, Your Majesty.

01:09:08.455 --> 01:09:11.795
So, where are we? It looks like some kind of house.

01:09:52.365 --> 01:09:55.205
If I prove the Jimjo's habitat is linked to the Left State Councilor,

01:09:55.735 --> 01:09:57.265
he will be finished for treason.

01:10:15.785 --> 01:10:18.555
- Gang, this place is... - Yes.

01:10:19.695 --> 01:10:22.325
Yes. We have finally found it.

01:10:26.965 --> 01:10:27.965
Your Majesty.

01:10:33.035 --> 01:10:34.745
Her feet are smooth, without a single callus.

01:10:35.405 --> 01:10:37.275
Those are not the feet of someone who has walked mountain trails.

01:10:38.345 --> 01:10:40.145
There was another Choraengi Mask.

01:10:40.545 --> 01:10:42.785
He must have known the layout of the Mount Inwang Cave...

01:10:42.885 --> 01:10:46.355
because he evaded a dozen men and blew himself up inside.

01:10:47.285 --> 01:10:48.955
Not only was he not wearing a Choraengi Mask,

01:10:49.555 --> 01:10:51.625
but she has never even been to the Mount Inwang Cave.

01:10:51.895 --> 01:10:52.895
Let go of me.

01:10:53.595 --> 01:10:54.625
Let go!

01:10:55.725 --> 01:10:56.725
Hey, you.

01:10:57.095 --> 01:11:00.435
I am asking what you have against me to treat me like this.

01:11:01.195 --> 01:11:02.635
Are you accusing me of ordering you...

01:11:03.265 --> 01:11:05.935
to raise Jimjo Birds in the cave beside the smithy...

01:11:06.075 --> 01:11:08.205
in the village at the foot of Mount Bukak?

01:11:09.175 --> 01:11:10.175
Yes.

01:11:10.475 --> 01:11:12.175
You explicitly told me to raise the Jimjo Birds...

01:11:12.545 --> 01:11:14.375
in the cave beside the smithy...

01:11:14.985 --> 01:11:17.445
in the village at the foot of Mount Bukak.

01:11:18.185 --> 01:11:19.255
You clearly said...

01:11:19.585 --> 01:11:20.915
it was in the cave beside the smithy...

01:11:21.055 --> 01:11:22.525
in the village at the foot of Mount Bukak.

01:11:23.185 --> 01:11:24.625
Is that what you said?

01:11:26.995 --> 01:11:32.135
I thought I heard it was a cave by the brewery below Mount Inwang.

01:11:32.835 --> 01:11:35.735
- That is what I heard as well. - Really?

01:11:37.965 --> 01:11:41.975
Did everyone see that? This woman is lying.

01:11:42.445 --> 01:11:44.815
The story about raising Jimjo Birds is a complete lie,

01:11:44.875 --> 01:11:47.345
so how can you believe her? Am I wrong?

01:11:58.655 --> 01:12:00.725
It is too late. We will stop for today.

01:12:02.225 --> 01:12:04.835
The interrogation will resume at first light.

01:12:05.165 --> 01:12:06.195
- Yes, Your Majesty! - Yes, Your Majesty!

01:12:06.495 --> 01:12:09.005
His Royal Highness, the Crown Prince, has arrived!

01:12:42.935 --> 01:12:43.935
Your Majesty.

01:12:44.405 --> 01:12:46.675
If you are here for the Royal Concubine, you have come in vain.

01:12:47.735 --> 01:12:49.305
The interrogation is over for today.

01:12:49.605 --> 01:12:53.415
I am not here for her. I am here for the Left State Councilor.

01:12:54.245 --> 01:12:55.385
What are you...

01:12:56.145 --> 01:13:00.315
Left State Councilor Kim Han Chul is behind the Jimjo incident.

01:13:07.325 --> 01:13:08.525
Do you have proof?

01:13:09.325 --> 01:13:10.624
I found a secret passage that connects...

01:13:10.625 --> 01:13:11.895
the Mount Inwang Cave...

01:13:12.295 --> 01:13:13.865
to the Left State Councilor's home.

01:13:22.905 --> 01:13:24.205
Well, now.

01:13:24.915 --> 01:13:28.615
Are you all as shocked as I am? Because I am utterly shocked.

01:13:28.945 --> 01:13:30.915
You see, I simply...

01:13:31.785 --> 01:13:35.485
followed a tunnel leading from the Jimjo cave,

01:13:36.225 --> 01:13:38.825
and what do you know? It led to the Left State Councilor's!

01:13:39.695 --> 01:13:40.725
Goodness.

01:13:44.765 --> 01:13:46.135
What are you staring at?

01:13:46.595 --> 01:13:50.105
Hey, you punk! Lower your eyes!

01:13:50.165 --> 01:13:52.035
You do not seem to get what is happening.

01:13:52.105 --> 01:13:54.504
Your master is no longer the Left State Councilor.

01:13:54.505 --> 01:13:55.574
He is now a traitor.

01:13:55.575 --> 01:13:56.645
And I should gouge your eyes out.

01:13:57.545 --> 01:13:59.515
- Prince Lee Un, where are you? - You had better...

01:14:22.865 --> 01:14:23.905
You pulled it off.

01:14:24.265 --> 01:14:25.305
Of course I did.

01:14:26.935 --> 01:14:28.105
I am just that good.

01:15:11.715 --> 01:15:12.715
The Crown Prince's Concubine.

01:15:14.985 --> 01:15:15.985
No.

01:15:17.755 --> 01:15:19.225
Kill the Crown Princess.

01:15:20.495 --> 01:15:24.195
(Moon River)

01:15:39.245 --> 01:15:41.244
The day your father is arrested,

01:15:41.245 --> 01:15:43.215
pack light and meet me at the greenhouse.

01:15:43.415 --> 01:15:44.945
We are going to run away together.

01:15:45.015 --> 01:15:48.255
Why do I keep having this dream? What is this memory?

01:15:48.315 --> 01:15:50.155
How nice.

01:15:50.325 --> 01:15:53.555
I will expose the Left State Councilor's crimes one by one.

01:15:53.625 --> 01:15:55.765
Arrest the family of the Crown Prince's Concubine.

01:15:55.895 --> 01:15:57.925
Going after their family is a low blow, is it not?

01:16:14.015 --> 01:16:18.245
(Moon River)
