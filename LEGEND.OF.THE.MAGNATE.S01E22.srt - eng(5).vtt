[Grand Vision for Long-Lasting Prosperity]

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:48.479
Everyone,

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.120
I behaved arrogantly and rudely
in Anhui before

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.650
and offended Old Master Hu.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:55.680
Today Old Master Hu

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.039
wants to apologize to me,

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.640
and I'd also like to apologize

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.910
to the entire

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.070
Anhui Tea Merchants' Association.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.590
Old Master Hu is a man of noble character,

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:07.990
and I respect him deeply.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.820
Let's turn the page

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.960
on everything that happened before

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.500
and not bring it up again.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.000
However, the gold-lettered plaque,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.120
"Top Tea Under Heaven,"

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.120
belongs to Anhui,

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.360
not to me alone,

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.150
and it should hang in the hall

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.480
of the Anhui Tea Merchants' Association.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.840
This

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.329
is my first gift

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.329
to Old Master Hu.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:30.630
My second gift

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.210
is the recipe for our Orchid Snow tea.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.320
Old Master Hu, please accept it,

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.710
make copies,

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.640
and distribute them
to all tea merchants in Anhui.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.150
Mr. Gu,

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.079
this...

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.020
this gift is far too valuable.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.000
Not even a fortune could buy it.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.560
If you don't explain your reason,

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.820
I cannot accept it.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.430
The reputation of Orchid Snow tea

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.680
has already spread far and wide,

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.700
but with just

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.120
my brother and me

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.590
and a few dozen mu

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.750
of poor farmland,

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.760
we can't produce much in a year.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.680
I'm afraid that in the future,

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.430
all kinds of counterfeits

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.930
might appear on the market

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.840
and damage its reputation,

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:07.400
and the blame

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.330
would fall on
the Anhui Tea Merchants' Association.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.680
So, Old Master Hu,

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.270
you must take this recipe

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.540
no matter what.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.710
You...

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:17.240
You...

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:18.640
You left me

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.310
no room to refuse.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.680
Mr. Gu, rest assured.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.050
If the Gu family's Orchid Snow tea

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:27.800
becomes popular throughout the land,

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.090
it will be thanks to you.

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.390
The Anhui Tea Merchants' Association
is at your service.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:35.990
I can't take this position.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:37.910
You see, I'm the kind of person

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.120
who can't stand hassles.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.590
I'm used to an easy, leisurely life.

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:41.750
Looking after my tea plantation,

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:42.560
free and easy,

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:43.810
suits me just fine.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.280
You should be the one in this position.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.270
Mr. Gu, you're being too modest.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:50.800
I'm not being modest at all.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.130
In these chaotic times,

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.560
hundreds of thousands of tea farmers
in Anhui

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.960
are suffering terribly.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.750
I think

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.800
Orchid Snow tea

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.310
might be our one ray of hope.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.520
If we can

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.450
promote this tea

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.440
successfully,

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:03.520
the people of Anhui

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.720
can live more easily.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.150
This would be a great deed

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.480
of the Anhui Tea Merchants' Association.

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:29.260
[Benefiting the Local Community]

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.210
This time, Gu

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.060
has restored the honor

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:37.420
of the people of Anhui.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.240
In the future, please put in

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.890
a good word for me in front of him.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:45.900
Me?

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.090
If it weren't for Gu,

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.800
could our tea

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.900
have sold for such good prices?

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:53.480
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:54.810
Think about it—

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.520
Silver Bud—

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:57.730
what a rustic name.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:58.620
Orchid Snow?

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.070
That's just perfect,

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.780
isn't it?

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:01.040
[Benefiting the Local Community]

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.360
Yes!

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.160
From now on, call him Second Master!

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.490
Call him Second Master!

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.360
Alright.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.220
-Second Master.
-Second Master.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.900
It's so boring on the march.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.250
I prepared for it in advance.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.870
Mr. Gu.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.310
How did those Anhui tea merchants

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.370
kowtow and admit their faults to you?

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.560
You must not let them off easily.

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.750
Thinking about it,
I was too young back then,

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.270
insisting on making this Orchid Snow tea.

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:49.730
I can't really blame them.

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:51.920
You were simply lucky.

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.750
Who else in this world
walks out their door

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.680
and runs into the Empress Dowager?

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.110
And who else

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:59.950
could earn her favor,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.270
with a single word from her

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:02.870
turning everything around?

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:06.720
Why do you think His Highness

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.830
was so accommodating?

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:08.870
He had no choice.

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.070
That plaque granted by the Empress Dowager

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:12.870
has him completely pinned down.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.360
When you invited me to that banquet,

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.360
that was also
at the Empress Dowager's behest,

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.000
wasn't it?

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:22.200
Of course.

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:24.000
However,

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:24.920
I didn't bask

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:26.680
in your glory for nothing.

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:27.800
After we take Hefei,

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.330
the credit
will be split between the two of us.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.250
Even if we have
to kill everyone in the city,

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:35.430
I won't hesitate.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.830
Mr. Gu,

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.240
this is the kind of luck

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.190
that doesn't come once in centuries.

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:50.750
Our dynasty rewards military merit
faster than anything.

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.310
With an opportunity like this,

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:53.990
you'll rise swiftly.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.470
You're a scholar.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.260
You should know this clearly.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:58.800
Since ancient times,

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.560
it's been made very clear—

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:03.260
a head taken

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.310
is

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.000
a rank gained.

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:10.000
Come on.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:10.480
Here.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:50.480
Ms. Su.

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:53.360
You'd better not go outside.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.870
My people are everywhere out there.

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:55.930
Without my orders,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.040
if anyone suddenly sees you coming out,

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.300
you'll lose your head.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.120
You really do look like

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.250
a high official now.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:09.930
Pacification Commissioner
of the imperial court.

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:12.070
How did you know?

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.000
Did you plant people

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.200
around Qiao Song too?

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.680
We were planning to kill Qiao Song,

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.000
but then we suddenly learned

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:20.750
that he brought someone

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:21.920
even the Empress Dowager

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.000
valued.

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:25.040
I was wondering who that could be.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.240
So it's an old friend.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.480
You came all this way

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.340
just to bring your head back to me.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.820
What a waste of effort.

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:33.870
I'm no friend to you.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:35.640
I'm a dead man.

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:37.200
That's right.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.030
Keeping someone like you around

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:40.360
would only get in my way.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:41.669
Tell me,

00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:44.290
do you have any last wishes

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.440
or messages?

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.100
I want you to persuade Li Cheng

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:52.810
that Hefei can no longer be defended.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.460
Tell him to withdraw early

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:55.600
and not drag down

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.270
the innocent people of the city.

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.000
And I'd also like to remind you:

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.840
when a great structure is collapsing,
a single beam can't hold it up.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:02.910
Your schemes

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.900
won't amount to anything.

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:06.150
You won't win.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.000
You still can't change

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.530
that sharp tongue of yours.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.510
Aren't you afraid of dying?

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:22.000
I am.

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:23.670
Aren't you?

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:26.820
Since I

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:28.550
ruined your plans before

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:31.150
and you almost got me killed,

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:32.890
I'd say we're even now.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.700
Time to talk business.

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:38.110
I didn't expect you to be a businessman.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:41.760
I want every

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:43.320
innocent civilian in Hefei

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.510
to survive.

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:47.470
Can we make that deal?

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:49.290
Go tell Li Cheng

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.020
that Hefei is now

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.500
surrounded on three sides.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.760
He still has one last chance of survival.

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:58.240
Even heroes can't escape love.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.630
You're still thinking about Miss Bai,
aren't you?

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:02.360
I'm not doing this for Miss Bai.

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:04.510
I'm doing this for all the citizens.

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:06.040
A real man does what he must.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.500
You've severely underestimated me.

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:12.240
You want him to withdraw,

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.300
but where can he go?

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.240
Under the walls of Jinling,

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.200
the court's northern
and southern camps are stationed.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.240
There are troops in the Zhejiang region
as well.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.120
As for Suzhou,

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:20.670
it depends on whether the prince there

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:22.070
is willing to take him in.

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:23.930
So we must work together.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.060
You help him plan a way out.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.550
Whatever you need from me,

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:28.610
I'll do my best.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:32.720
I can't believe

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.850
you still dare to speak to me like this.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.400
I'll remember your life for now.

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:46.890
I'll come back for you.

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:06.480
Greetings, Lord Gu!

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.500
[Hefei, Qing Army Station]

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:11.810
Mr. Gu,

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.050
act just like me.

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:14.030
If you treat them well

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:15.340
and see them as equals,

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.030
they'll only walk all over you.

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:18.860
That's how the bureaucracy works.

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:19.530
Mr. Qiao,

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.930
I'm hardly an official.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.270
I don't need to learn those tricks, do I?

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:24.440
Lords, you must be tired

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:25.870
from the long journey.

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:27.910
Greetings, Pacification Commissioner.

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:28.640
Mr. Bao Qing,

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:29.960
I'm not an official.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.440
You don't need to salute me.

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.300
How can that be?

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:34.550
Mr. Gu,
you are the Pacification Commissioner,

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:36.870
personally appointed
by the Empress Dowager.

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:39.000
That's far above my rank

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:40.600
as a fourth-rank military attaché.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.550
How dare I break imperial protocol?

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:43.510
Come on.

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:44.150
Please.

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:46.750
The food and wine are already prepared.

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:49.510
Music!

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.270
Come on, everyone.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.980
Let's toast to Mr. Qiao.

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:57.000
Mr. Qiao's arrival

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.810
is like the rising sun driving away evil.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.120
The siege has lasted so long,

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.150
and today we finally see hope.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.960
With the Pacification Commissioner here,

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.840
the local people feel
as if blessed with a new parent.

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.670
The banners and umbrellas of gratitude

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:13.150
are too many to count.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.030
The Empress Dowager's
exceptional promotion of you

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:17.490
couldn't be more fitting.

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:18.590
We would also like to toast you.

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:19.110
Wait.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.200
What banners and umbrellas of gratitude?

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.360
I haven't done anything.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.090
How could there be such things?

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.150
You guys are so good at this.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.750
Of course.

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:36.120
We had to prepare early.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:36.870
You can't really wait

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:39.600
for the commoners
to bring these things, can you?

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:41.170
Mr. Bao Qing,

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:42.600
there's one thing I don't understand.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.000
I'd like to ask you about it.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.510
Please, Pacification Commissioner.

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:47.710
I heard Hefei is about to run out of food.

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:48.670
When are you planning

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:49.930
to launch the assault?

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:57.510
We were waiting for your order.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:00.000
As soon as you command it,
I'll marshal the troops and attack.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.510
I don't understand military affairs.

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:02.570
I'm just saying—

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:04.550
if you keep the siege going like this,

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:05.360
the people inside the city

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.600
really will starve to death.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:07.720
That's nothing to worry about.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.840
Only when those traitors

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:11.860
are too hungry to lift their swords

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.180
can we achieve victory in one battle.

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:19.120
Remind me—

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.810
what is my post again?

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:21.770
I've forgotten.

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:24.030
You're the Pacification Commissioner.

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:25.670
So does what I say carry weight?

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:26.550
Of course.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:27.870
When you first arrived,

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:28.700
I said

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.990
everything would follow your command.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.200
That is how the court

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.080
shows its care for the people
and its defense of the realm.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.790
Right, exactly.

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:38.270
In that case,

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:39.360
if you starve everyone to death,

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.890
who am I supposed to pacify?

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:45.440
Or...

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.840
are you trying to take my job from me?

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:49.350
Besides,

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.510
most of those so‑called enemy troops

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:53.000
are actually

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.790
common folk in Hefei

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:55.320
who were dragged into this.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:56.440
If they end up

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.480
starved to death by you,

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.150
or cut down

00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.320
by your swords,

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:00.600
wouldn't that tarnish

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.660
the Empress Dowager's benevolence?

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:04.030
Have you

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.330
ever seriously thought this through?

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.720
Mr. Gu,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:12.930
I truly admire

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:14.440
what you just said.

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:15.870
I think

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:18.380
they've been starved long enough.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.580
It's time we attack.

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:22.320
Right.

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:23.550
Mr. Qiao,

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.340
I've made my decision.

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:27.520
I'll go home to inform my family first.

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:28.280
In a few days,

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:30.150
I will personally go to Hefei

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.510
to persuade them to surrender.

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:32.320
That won't do.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.320
If anything happens to you,

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:35.840
I don't have enough heads

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:36.960
to pay for it.

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:38.110
Rest assured.

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:39.750
Once this battle is over,

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:41.320
I'll make sure your military merits
are recorded

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.320
and that you're granted an official post.

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.190
Mr. Bao Qing,

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:46.000
how could you forget what you just said?

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.630
"everything would follow
Pacification Commissioner's command."

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:51.000
"That is how the imperial court"

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.330
"shows its care for the people
and its defense of the realm."

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:03.820
I'll head back now.

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:05.850
Well...

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.150
[Marshal]

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:11.490
Pacification Commissioner.

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:13.530
Pacification Commissioner.

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:22.600
Qiao,

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.490
this Mr. Gu is indeed
cut out to be an official.

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:31.870
That's what you get
for being so careless with your words.

00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:33.330
How was I supposed to know?

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.540
He learned so fast.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:37.240
With just a few lines,
he had me speechless.

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.060
Don't underestimate him.

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:41.670
We'd better

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:43.940
not offend men like him.

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.080
Why do you think the Empress Dowager

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.200
suddenly gave him
the title of Pacification Commissioner

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.480
out of nowhere?

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:52.480
Why?

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:56.880
She's long been displeased

00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:58.790
with the Sixth Prince.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.360
You and I both work for His Highness.

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:02.270
So she gave Gu

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:04.870
a nominal post
as Pacification Commissioner.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.720
Though it's just a nominal post,

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.720
if you dare to disobey his orders,

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:11.480
that becomes a real problem.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:13.480
Also,

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:16.480
You must

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:17.940
keep him here.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.000
Why?

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.580
Who gets the credit if he achieves merit?

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.940
And if he causes trouble—

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:28.140
who will be blamed?

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:33.480
You are wise.

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:36.840
But there's one thing

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.300
I still don't understand.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.240
Since we're holding him in high regard

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:41.970
and giving him credit for free,

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:42.830
why is he still insisting on

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:43.670
going into the city
to persuade them to surrender?

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:45.030
That's a suicide mission.

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:46.360
Why didn't you stop him?

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:47.360
Did you try to stop him?

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.080
I did.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:48.570
And?

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:49.550
I couldn't stop him.

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:51.840
Then he's choosing death himself.

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:52.910
Nothing we can do.

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:55.750
He's the Pacification Commissioner.

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:58.160
That's his duty.

00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:04.490
[Gu's Mansion]

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:19.160
Why aren't you wearing the tiger skin?

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:19.920
[Blessings and Auspiciousness]

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:20.720
I waited half the night

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.430
hoping to see you in it.

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:25.310
Pingyuan, you know the Empress Dowager.

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:26.640
Why don't you talk to her?

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:27.680
You don't want to be an official anyway.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:28.480
Get me

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:29.640
a tiger skin to wear.

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:31.440
Just imagine me
walking around the village—

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:32.700
how majestic I'd look.

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:36.480
What do you need a tiger skin for?

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.070
When I was chased by wolves
beyond the pass,

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:39.790
I didn't see you coming to save me.

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:41.160
All you ever do is borrow my power.

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.220
You're so heartless.

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:43.070
I searched everywhere for you.

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:43.480
I can't even remember

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:44.740
how many times I cried.

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.900
Try to be stronger from now on.

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:51.670
Stop crying all the time.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.450
Pingyuan, seriously—

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:56.500
someone's offering you an official post.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:57.720
Why won't you take it?

00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:00.480
Enough.
Don't talk to me about being an official.

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.680
I'm already annoyed.

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:03.160
They say,
"Even the prime minister's relatives"

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.060
"hold seventh-rank posts."

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:05.400
If you became an official,

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.920
I could become a magistrate.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.070
Anyone who dares disobey me,

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.790
I'd slam the table

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:09.720
and have them punished.

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:10.250
Get lost!

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:19.960
Mother,

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:21.160
I'm back.

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:22.940
If you're resting,

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.030
I'll come pay my respects in the morning.

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:25.790
Come in.

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:39.720
Pingwen said you almost lost your life.

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:42.510
I was scared to death.

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.880
A friend dragged me beyond the pass.

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:46.740
I left in a hurry

00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:48.030
and didn't have time

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:48.960
to tell Pingwen.

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:51.510
I don't believe that.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.400
Mother, I promise you

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.310
I won't go that far away again.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:02.880
Mother,

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:05.110
I have some good news for you.

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:06.640
This time in the capital,

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.700
I handed a note to Sixth Prince.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.640
He promised to have people

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.240
in Nine Gates Infantry Commander's Office

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:13.700
help me look for my father.

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:15.180
If even they

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.130
cannot find him,

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:18.140
then he really can't be found.

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:19.680
Don't be too upset.

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:22.000
I'm not upset.

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:24.960
I just can't help

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.750
holding onto a small hope.

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:29.940
I just feel like he's

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:31.510
still alive somewhere.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.480
If he is,

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:36.880
knowing that you

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:39.470
and his two sons are waiting at home,

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:41.210
how could he not come back?

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.610
Please don't say that anymore.

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:46.150
It only brings more pain.

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:49.620
If you're safe,

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:51.480
and if you have the chance,

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:53.360
continue searching for him.

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:55.800
Even if he's dead,

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:58.510
at least I'll be able to cry at his grave,

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:01.150
and that would give me peace.

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:04.700
I'm going to sleep.

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:15.150
I'm not going anywhere tonight.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.140
I'll stay right here with you.

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:18.900
Sleep well.

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:35.940
[Hefei City]

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:45.460
I am Gu Pingyuan,
Pacification Commissioner of Anhui.

00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:47.570
I want to see General Li Cheng!

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:33.030
Yimei.

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:35.720
How have you been?

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:40.000
Why are you here?

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.100
Am I not allowed to be here?

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:45.830
I didn't know you had become

00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:47.690
the Pacification Commissioner.

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:52.160
Life is unpredictable.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:53.880
Who can guarantee

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:55.740
what role they'll play tomorrow?

00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:58.230
Yesterday you were Bai Yimei,

00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:01.000
and today you're playing
the Princess Consort, aren't you?

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.800
I can never win a debate with you.

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:04.310
Tell me,

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:05.960
why are you here?

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:08.030
Tell me and then just leave.

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:09.430
This is a dangerous city.

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:11.230
I need to see Li Cheng.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.480
He's busy with military affairs
and won't see you.

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.110
If there's nothing else, just go now.

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:20.370
What military affairs do you still have?

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:21.550
Right now in Hefei,

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:22.750
people are starving.

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.850
If you don't escape now, when will you?

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:29.090
Do you want to drag everyone in the city
down with you?

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:32.270
You really do

00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:33.950
speak for the imperial court.

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:35.270
Yimei,

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:38.130
now that you are a Princess Consort,

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:39.730
your heart has hardened too?

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:43.580
Do you really want that many people
buried with you?

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.270
Why make things difficult for me?

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:47.030
I'm not.

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.370
I'm begging you.

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:51.090
Even if you choose

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:52.550
to go down a dead‑end path,

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:55.770
at least
spare the innocent people of Hefei.

00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:57.600
Leave them a chance to live.

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:00.350
If Mr. Bai

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.790
saw you like this,

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:04.320
he would be heartbroken.

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:07.980
Gu,

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.500
you can't talk about me like that.

00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:11.770
Even if I wanted to leave,

00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:13.500
this isn't my decision to make.

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:18.920
What's going on here?

00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:25.500
How come you two old friends are arguing

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:26.750
the moment you meet?

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:28.930
What he just said

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.640
was for our own good.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:33.800
Brew some tea.

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:42.000
Please.

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:50.990
In these circumstances,

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.020
this is the best

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:54.550
I can offer you.

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:07.470
Is this

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:09.440
what you're eating now?

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:11.280
This is good stuff.

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:13.880
I tore out the gardens
in the Prince's Mansion—

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:14.750
front and back—

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:16.710
and planted a lot of peanuts.

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:19.250
I haven't asked you yet—

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:21.650
should I call you Gu,

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:24.000
or Lord Gu now?

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:26.990
Just call me Gu Pingyuan.

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:30.720
It was petty of me.

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.400
My apologies, Gu.

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:39.310
I'm here today for...

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:41.030
I heard the title
"Pacification Commissioner"

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:42.550
just now when I got here.

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.680
Good.

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:45.920
Very good.

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:49.280
In this entire world,

00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:51.960
among all the civil
and military officials of the Qing court—

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.640
plus that old emperor—

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:54.800
not one of them

00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:56.030
deserves that title.

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:57.160
But you...

00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:59.380
you're the perfect person

00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:01.030
for it.

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.110
Now that you're here,

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:05.510
it puts my mind at ease.

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.090
Oh right, Yimei.

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.070
Go to the storeroom.

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:13.310
There's a good bottle of wine

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:14.510
under the blade rack.

00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:15.310
Bring it here.

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:17.190
I want to have a drink with Gu.

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:19.790
You haven't eaten anything yet.

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:20.720
We have peanuts.

00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.830
Go on.

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:31.980
Given the state of Hefei right now,

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:32.880
Gu,

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.800
do you have any advice for me?

00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:37.750
Hefei is now surrounded

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:38.670
on three sides.

00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:41.080
Why don't you withdraw?

00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:45.200
Once you cross the Yangtze River,
you'll reach Jinling.

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:46.510
It seems

00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:48.070
you really haven't been in office
for long.

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:48.550
Yes.

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:51.920
If we leave Hefei,

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:53.370
where can we go?

00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:54.960
Zhejiang?

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:58.410
The regime's troops there
are waiting for us.

00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:59.070
Suzhou?

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:00.880
My old brothers

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:02.160
won't agree to that.

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:05.310
Jinling?

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:09.300
Outside Jinling,

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:12.600
there are hundreds of thousands
of troops in the north and south camps.

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.460
Even if I fight my way into the city

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.750
and sit with my brothers,

00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:17.590
my end...

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.480
may be even worse.

00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:21.000
Why?

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:24.980
Do you know about Jinling's

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:26.110
current situation?

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:27.160
I don't.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.620
My brothers are fighting among themselves.

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:36.360
The crisis will unfold
in a matter of days.

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:41.510
Our death is near.

00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:19.290
Gu,

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:22.020
this toast is for you.

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:23.880
You were right earlier.

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:25.790
I shouldn't drag

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:27.830
everyone in Hefei down with me.

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:31.810
After this drink, you should go back.

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:32.980
Tomorrow morning,

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.110
I'll open the gates and let the people go,

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:36.920
without harming a single soul.

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:40.550
As for my wife and me—

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:43.550
we will repay your great kindness

00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:44.550
in our next life.

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:46.200
Gu,

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:48.190
I'd like to toast you as well.

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:49.580
I was rude earlier.

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:50.850
Please forgive me.

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:53.350
Thank you for always treating me kindly

00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:54.960
and for helping me bury my father.

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:55.880
My husband and I

00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:58.600
will repay your kindness in our next life.

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:03.030
Fine.

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:06.160
One of you chooses loyalty,
the other chooses love.

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.090
But have you thought about others?

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:11.360
Who are you referring to?

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.070
Your brothers.

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:16.700
What are you trying to say?

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.480
They've never been princes,

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.400
nor lived in a mansion as large as yours.

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:24.040
What do you think
they're eating right now?

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:25.750
I doubt they're willing

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:27.110
to die with you.

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:32.880
Do you know

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.010
what you're talking about?

00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:37.970
We're all born and raised by our parents.

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:39.420
As long as a man can fill his stomach,

00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:41.020
who would choose rebellion?

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:42.480
Yes.

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:44.430
You chose righteousness

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:45.590
and loyalty—

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:47.840
but did you ever ask them?

00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:50.150
Do you dare ask them this question

00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:51.030
and let those who don't want to follow you

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:52.550
leave the city with me,

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:54.310
leaving you to die alone?

00:28:58.410 --> 00:29:01.110
Anyone who disrupts the army's morale
before battle

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:02.370
deserves execution.

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:03.970
Don't hurt Gu.

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:05.360
Why did you say that?

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.030
Leave now!

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:07.430
Did I say anything wrong?

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:09.280
Your lives matter,

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:10.740
but theirs don't?

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:12.750
If you can't accept that,

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:13.650
then kill me!

00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:14.310
Guards!

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:15.070
Yes!

00:29:15.550 --> 00:29:16.200
Honey!

00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:17.160
Honey!

00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:19.440
Pass my order.

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:21.640
I'll address the troops before the battle.

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:22.400
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:25.820
Come with me.

00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:27.440
I'll show you

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:29.160
if any of my men are cowards.

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:44.110
[Li]

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:48.720
Heaven soldiers have descended!

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.460
Peace will come to all lands!

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:50.550
[Li]

00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:52.110
Heaven soldiers have descended!

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:53.730
Peace will come to all lands!

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:55.580
Heaven soldiers have descended!

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:57.500
Peace will come to all lands!

[Weiwu Gate]

00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:07.210
I joined the Resistance Army when I was 6.

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:09.540
[Weiwu Gate]

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:11.420
Back then my brothers asked me,

00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:14.210
"Why do farmers toil all year"

00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:17.660
"only to starve by the roadside?"

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:21.460
"Why do laborers
work themselves to the bone"

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:22.790
"only for their bodies"

00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:25.840
"to be thrown into the fields
as fertilizer?"

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:27.370
[Weiwu Gate]

00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:29.710
The officials and nobles of this world

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:31.510
lie to us

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:33.730
and whip us with their lashes.

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:36.130
They oppress our parents,

00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:37.770
abuse our children,

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.790
and drain us completely.

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:43.740
In a world like this—

00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:45.750
how could we not rise up?

00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:46.710
[Weiwu Gate]

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:48.590
Kill!

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:50.270
Kill!

00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:54.070
Kill!

00:30:54.270 --> 00:30:56.000
Kill!

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:03.120
Many of you are my old brothers

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:05.750
who came from Guangxi.

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.000
And some of you

00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:10.590
joined us in the past year or two.

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:12.980
Now we're trapped here

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:14.570
in Hefei

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:16.020
with nowhere to go.

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.060
The great battle is imminent.

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:22.120
I won't force anyone.

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:24.710
Those who choose to stay,

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:26.820
finish the remaining food

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.280
and sharpen your blades.

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:30.130
After we die,

00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:32.520
we'll continue to be brothers.

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.080
Those who don't wish to stay—

00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:42.980
tomorrow morning

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:45.740
the Qing Army will pull back 10 miles.

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:48.960
They've sent a Pacification Commissioner.

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:49.960
You can go with him

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:51.930
and return home.

00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:54.870
No one is allowed to stop you.

00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:57.590
Our blades

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.130
will never fall upon our own brothers!

[Weiwu Gate]

[Desheng Gate]

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:50.490
Satisfied now?

00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:55.350
Would you like to ask

00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:57.210
the rest of your brothers as well?

00:32:59.690 --> 00:33:00.750
Do you really think

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:02.080
I don't dare to kill you?

00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:06.330
Since I left Ningguta,

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:09.270
I've been walking on the edge every day.

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:10.960
If everyone in the city

00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:13.310
can be saved because of me today,

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.400
my death will be worth it.

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:21.880
Look at these people.

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:24.520
After the war,

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:24.960
[Desheng Gate]

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:27.020
they'll all be farmers without land.

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:29.080
You should be happy for them.

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:32.930
What difference does it make
if they leave the city?

00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:35.240
Everyone's fate

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:37.390
is already written by heaven.

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:41.290
Is there really

00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:42.690
an all‑powerful heaven?

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:45.460
I don't believe it.

00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:47.440
If there really was one,

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:49.350
there'd be no war,

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:51.270
no disasters.

00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:56.680
And your rebellion—

00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:58.920
was that heaven's idea too?

00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:35.960
Sir.

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:38.080
Please invite Mr. Gu.

Mr. Gu, please.

00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:51.960
Mr. Gu, you risked your life

for the country.

Thank you for your hard work.

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:55.960
I don't deserve such praise.

to the rightful side,

listen up!

Lay down your weapons

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:13.070
and gather at the North Camp!

00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:14.800
Weren't you supposed to send us home?

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.000
We have no weapons left!

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.400

don't!

Don't worry, Mr. Gu.

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:38.840
Since they've already surrendered,

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:40.370
they're still citizens of the Qing Empire.

00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:41.370
You can't do this.

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:42.860
You misunderstood.

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:43.510
It's a misunderstanding.

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:44.510
I'll talk to them.

00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:51.030
Fellow brothers,

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:53.400
I am Qiao Song, the Governor of Anhui.

00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:55.590
Since you've surrendered,

00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:57.960
you're still good subjects
of the imperial court.

00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:58.620
Therefore,

00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:01.030
we've cleared out the North Camp
to house you.

00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:01.650
First,

00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:03.110
you've been under siege too long.

00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:04.480
Your bodies are weak

00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:06.000
and need food.

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:07.000
Second,

00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:08.440
you need to shave your heads.

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:08.880
Third,

00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:11.030
you need to
change out of your military uniforms.

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:12.320
The area around for hundreds of miles

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:13.800
is filled with
the imperial court's troops.

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:15.530
You can't just go out like this.

00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:17.110
If you think

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:18.930
I have any ulterior motives...

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:20.190
Come on.

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:21.690
Put down your guns!

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:22.880
Clear the way!

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:25.330
If anyone still wants to leave,

00:36:25.590 --> 00:36:26.400
I...

00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:28.880
will respectfully see you off.

00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:36.360
Let's go, brothers!

00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:38.280
The food is ready!

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:40.090
The water is boiling!

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:41.720
After eating,

00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:43.760
you can bathe and get a shave.

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:46.220
Tomorrow,
you'll all get your travel money!

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:47.030
Let's go!

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:48.440
Come on.

00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:49.830
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:55.830
Gu.

00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:56.420
Come on.

00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:57.320
Let's go for a drink.

00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:57.840
Sir,

00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:00.340
I apologize
for my offensive words earlier.

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:01.760
Now you're being too formal with me.

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.440
Gu, your loyalty and bravery
are unmatched.

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:05.150
Alone, risking your life,

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:07.510
you rescued
so many civilians and soldiers.

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:09.590
I've already had the adviser
draft a memorial

00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:12.120
and rush it to the throne
to report your merit.

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:13.450
Yes.

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:15.320
The Empress Dowager and Sixth Prince

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:16.760
will be very pleased when they see it.

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:18.880
You'll certainly be promoted.

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:20.290
We must have

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:22.220
a preemptive celebration drink.

00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:23.800
That won't be necessary.

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:24.280
Let's go.

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:24.710
Please.

00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:25.480
Please.

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:38.450
Your Highness.

00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:43.840
Who allowed the Princess Consort
to come up?

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:44.840
Don't blame them.

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:46.230
I insisted on coming.

00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:49.920
Stand back.

00:37:54.850 --> 00:37:56.090
I'll keep you company.

00:37:56.090 --> 00:37:57.750
What were you thinking about?

00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:02.670
I was thinking...

00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:05.030
if we weren't in wartime,

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:06.190
you and I

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:08.710
standing up here on the city wall
enjoying the view

00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:09.840
would be wonderful.

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:14.040
If there were no war,

00:38:14.110 --> 00:38:15.800
you'd still be mining coal in Guangxi.

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:17.200
I wouldn't even know you.

00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:18.710
Yes.

00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:19.920
Perhaps

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:22.170
you've already married Gu Pingyuan.

00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:24.000
What?

00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:26.190
Are you still angry with him?

00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:29.830
A real man distinguishes
between gratitude and grudges.

00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:31.500
He treated you well.

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:33.450
Even though he offended me,

00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:35.080
I won't hold it against him.

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:38.370
This Gu—

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:40.320
he's first‑class
in both character and ability.

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:41.150
I'm just worried

00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:43.230
that being around those corrupt officials,

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:45.890
he'll get himself into trouble
sooner or later.

00:38:46.070 --> 00:38:47.000
What do you mean?

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:49.930
Never mind.

00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:52.590
Not understanding this makes life easier.

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:55.060
I'm just curious.

00:38:58.150 --> 00:39:00.150
You still care about him, don't you?

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:03.920
Look.

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.190
All those densely packed

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:08.850
Qing troops outside the city—

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:10.670
they know we're short

00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:12.150
on food and ammunition—

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:14.850
so why haven't they attacked?

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:18.030
Because they want to make money.

00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:21.110
As long as we're still alive,

00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:22.580
they can

00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:24.670
keep asking the imperial court for men,

00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:25.360
money,

00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:26.400
and weapons,

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:29.580
and the imperial court will keep giving.

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:31.880
Once the imperial court
can no longer provide,

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:33.080
then they'll attack.

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:35.440
In their eyes, we're nothing

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:37.790
but a tool for promotion and profit.

00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:41.880
Gu came to persuade us to surrender

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:44.540
because someone was trying to kill him.

00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:46.360
They wanted to use me

00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:47.760
to take his life.

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:49.590
There are no good people

00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:50.870
around him.

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:53.940
You mean

00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:56.400
they sent him here to die?

00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:59.700
But Gu is

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:01.900
extremely clever.

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:04.090
He must have seen through this.

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:06.220
That's also his weakness.

00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.880
What?

00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:10.470
Being too kind-hearted.

00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:14.370
In these chaotic times,
good people don't survive.

00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:19.550
Honey,

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:23.010
it's windy up here. Please go down now.

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:24.030
Guard!

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:26.120
Send the Princess Consort down.

00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:27.070
Yes.

00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:46.890
They're about to attack.

00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:16.570
Brothers!

00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:18.550
There's food, brothers!

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:23.180
Don't rush, brothers!

00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:24.760
There are stir-fried dishes over there!

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:25.600
And wine too!

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:27.410
There's plenty!

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:29.480
Don't fight over it! Don't fight over it!

00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:30.110
There's enough for everyone!

00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:31.120
Don't rush!

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:33.160
Slow down! Slow down!

00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:35.910
Give me one! Give me one!

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:52.320
Mr. Gu.

00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:56.400
Mr. Gu.

00:41:58.360 --> 00:41:59.360
Mr. Gu!

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:01.930
You deserve the most credit!

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:05.130
A toast to you

00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:06.660
from the two of us.

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:08.360
-Here.
-Fill it up.

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:10.440
-Fill it up.
-Sirs,

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:12.070
I really can't handle alcohol.

00:42:12.070 --> 00:42:13.320
Please stop forcing me to drink.

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:14.000
Alright.

00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:16.440
Gu, that's absolutely unacceptable.

00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:19.110
Come on.

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:21.920
Come on.

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:25.260
If I give you one reason,

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:26.710
I can skip this drink.

00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:29.800
What is it?

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:31.920
When you

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:33.490
sent me into the city today,

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:35.270
you didn't think

00:42:35.290 --> 00:42:37.350
I wouldn't make it back alive, right?

00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:52.540
Mr. Gu,

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:54.920
what makes you say that?

00:42:57.830 --> 00:42:59.640
What qualifications do I have

00:42:59.670 --> 00:43:01.440
to be this Pacification Commissioner?
