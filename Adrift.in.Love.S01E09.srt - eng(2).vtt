Is Yi Fu here?

00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:19.352
Yes, he's in the restroom.

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:21.688
Have a seat. I'll get your favorite drink.

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:23.489
Take a seat.

00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:43.801
It's his birthday today.

00:00:45.086 --> 00:00:46.588
Yes.

00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:48.973
He's celebrating his birthday
with his friends over there.

00:00:49.674 --> 00:00:52.135
He even made a birthday wish for me just now.

00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:54.637
He wished that I'd stay single forever.

00:00:54.637 --> 00:00:55.972
What?

00:00:55.972 --> 00:00:57.773
I was dumbfounded.

00:01:39.838 --> 00:01:43.654
[Episode 9: After the dust settles,
are we still in love?]

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:11.005
Table two, watch him.

00:02:11.005 --> 00:02:13.024
I think he's drunk.

00:02:17.262 --> 00:02:18.938
I'm sorry.

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:23.726
I'm sorry.

00:02:23.726 --> 00:02:26.729
I was really busy at work today
and couldn't get away.

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:28.857
Why are you so drunk?

00:02:28.857 --> 00:02:31.075
Let's go have spicy hotpot, okay?

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:35.663
- Let's go.
- Happy birthday, Yi Fu.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.043
Let's go.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.674
We're off. Bye.

00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:16.631
What's on your mind?

00:03:16.631 --> 00:03:18.831
The fried dough sticks are getting soggy.

00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:21.163
Nothing.

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.207
Are you still mad?

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:31.294
I didn't cook for you,
but brought you here for spicy hotpot.

00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:34.013
No, spicy hotpot is good.

00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:38.243
I'm going to the restroom first.

00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:45.667
Someone was looking for you.

00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:08.308
I had too much to drink earlier.

00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:09.711
She forced me to take these photos.

00:05:09.711 --> 00:05:11.060
I have nothing to do with her.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.895
I was wondering why
she was looking at me so strangely.

00:05:12.895 --> 00:05:14.731
It turns out I was the one who got in the way.

00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:16.149
I knew we wouldn't last three months.

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:17.692
She took these photos on purpose
and sent them to me.

00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:19.527
Why would I like a girl like her?

00:05:19.527 --> 00:05:22.955
Really? You looked so happy in the photos.

00:05:28.494 --> 00:05:31.247
There's nothing going on between us.

00:05:31.247 --> 00:05:33.541
Okay, I'm sorry.
I was in a bad mood and drank too much.

00:05:33.541 --> 00:05:35.084
I promise it won't happen again.

00:05:35.084 --> 00:05:37.462
I saw those messages and photos.

00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:39.972
I just can't believe you.

00:05:40.631 --> 00:05:42.224
Xin Tong.

00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:48.230
What can I do to make you believe me?

00:05:48.931 --> 00:05:50.732
Call her?

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:53.986
Okay, I'll call her now.

00:06:05.406 --> 00:06:07.416
Do you believe me now?

00:06:10.078 --> 00:06:11.371
There's nothing going on between us.

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:12.372
Besides, I'm in a terrible mood today.

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:15.632
I'm not in the mood for this nonsense.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.678
Why would you be in a bad mood
on your birthday?

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:24.634
You were right.

00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:27.644
I lost my stocks, my money, and my shop.

00:06:29.013 --> 00:06:31.023
I have nothing now.

00:06:38.606 --> 00:06:40.908
How did this happen?

00:06:42.735 --> 00:06:45.363
I don't know why this happened.

00:06:45.363 --> 00:06:47.623
I don't know what I should do.

00:06:56.457 --> 00:06:59.085
Okay, I understand.

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:01.115
We'll face it together.

Don't run!

00:07:57.768 --> 00:07:59.312
Fucking trash!

00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:02.231
Running? Just wait until I catch you!

00:08:02.231 --> 00:08:03.999
Stop!

00:08:07.612 --> 00:08:09.121
Are you okay?

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:27.604
Hey!

00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:30.142
She ran that way.

00:08:56.827 --> 00:09:00.589
Gu Hou Ze Psychiatric Clinic.

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:07.429
I still need to clean your wound.

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:11.801
Your name is Gu Hou Ze?

00:09:11.801 --> 00:09:13.928
- Yes.
- Is this your clinic?

00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:15.291
Yes.

00:09:21.769 --> 00:09:24.397
Why was that guy chasing you?

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:25.523
Do you owe him money?

00:09:25.523 --> 00:09:28.033
He owes me money.

00:09:30.152 --> 00:09:31.737
He wants to take advantage of me.

00:09:31.737 --> 00:09:34.323
He didn't pay when he was done.

00:09:34.323 --> 00:09:36.583
So, I just took the money and ran.

00:09:41.497 --> 00:09:44.000
How can I work like this?

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.675
What do you do?

00:09:47.169 --> 00:09:50.389
I'm a masseuse. Feels good, right?

00:09:51.632 --> 00:09:54.059
Let me clean your hands, too.

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.938
How can I go to work like this?

00:10:03.311 --> 00:10:04.520
It's all your fault.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.988
Otherwise, I wouldn't have fallen.

00:10:08.065 --> 00:10:10.117
Fine, I apologize.

00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:15.247
Thank you, Dr. Gu.

00:10:26.167 --> 00:10:28.093
Do you have an appointment?

00:10:30.546 --> 00:10:32.651
I bought too many tangerines.

00:10:32.651 --> 00:10:33.716
Here, have some.

00:10:33.716 --> 00:10:35.308
Thank you.

00:10:37.845 --> 00:10:40.181
These are oranges, right?

00:10:40.181 --> 00:10:41.223
Are they?

00:10:41.223 --> 00:10:43.351
Yes.

00:10:43.351 --> 00:10:45.061
But they look so similar.

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:46.937
They're all the same.

00:10:46.937 --> 00:10:48.814
Come in and have a seat.

00:10:48.814 --> 00:10:50.449
Sure.

00:11:02.286 --> 00:11:04.455
I made too much.

00:11:04.455 --> 00:11:06.624
I thought I'd pack you a lunchbox.

00:11:06.624 --> 00:11:09.377
Why do you always either make too much food,

00:11:09.377 --> 00:11:12.512
or buy too much fruit?

00:11:13.714 --> 00:11:15.800
I'm just dumb.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.135
I just thought...

00:11:18.135 --> 00:11:19.679
I happened to cook too much.

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:23.474
Don't you think food tastes better when shared?

00:11:23.474 --> 00:11:24.517
Yes.

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:26.435
- Where's yours?
- I'll eat at home.

00:11:26.435 --> 00:11:29.237
Didn't you say it tastes better when shared?

00:11:30.272 --> 00:11:31.721
Yes.

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:38.197
What's wrong?

00:11:38.197 --> 00:11:41.158
Did you add sugar?

00:11:41.158 --> 00:11:43.160
Did I?

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.496
I think so...

00:11:45.496 --> 00:11:48.040
They look rather similar.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.417
I know.

00:11:49.417 --> 00:11:51.293
Just think of it as a southern flavor.

00:11:51.293 --> 00:11:53.512
You'll get used to it.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.292
Tell me if I need to adjust the pressure.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.021
I think it's okay.

00:13:09.021 --> 00:13:11.077
A little harder.

00:13:13.042 --> 00:13:14.084
Like this?

00:13:14.084 --> 00:13:15.719
Yes.

00:13:17.755 --> 00:13:20.807
Aren't you curious
why I'm in this line of work?

00:13:22.176 --> 00:13:24.060
Does it matter?

00:13:26.931 --> 00:13:29.225
You must really like New Zealand.

00:13:29.225 --> 00:13:31.276
How did you know?

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:39.401
When I'm massaging customers,

00:13:39.401 --> 00:13:46.075
I always imagine myself
in New Zealand, looking at the sea,

00:13:46.075 --> 00:13:50.496
kneading dough, baking pizza.

00:13:50.496 --> 00:13:52.547
That would make me feel better.

00:13:53.666 --> 00:13:58.887
So, now, you're treating me like dough.

You slept for a long time.

00:14:46.927 --> 00:14:48.937
You must be tired from work.

I haven't slept so deeply in a long time.

Yes.

A doctor is obligated
to keep a patient's condition confidential.

they'll have to take legal responsibility.

to adjust your breathing.

00:17:43.979 --> 00:17:46.440
Relax.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.358
What do you want?

00:17:48.358 --> 00:17:50.743
You know what I want.

00:17:51.653 --> 00:17:53.371
To leave this place.

00:17:54.198 --> 00:17:57.959
I'm sorry, but I don't think
I'm capable of doing that.

00:17:59.244 --> 00:18:03.624
You're prone to violence, self-harm,

00:18:03.624 --> 00:18:05.709
and severe delusions.

00:18:05.709 --> 00:18:06.877

00:18:06.877 --> 00:18:10.172
you must be hospitalized for proper treatment.

00:18:10.172 --> 00:18:13.383
Don't think I don't know
you're fooling Chief Zhu.

00:18:13.383 --> 00:18:18.263
You claim I have delusional jealousy.

00:18:18.263 --> 00:18:19.932
You're the delusional one.

00:18:19.932 --> 00:18:21.850
How could it be me?

00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:23.735
Have you been sleeping well lately?

00:18:24.478 --> 00:18:27.981
I just want you to face the truth.

00:18:27.981 --> 00:18:29.775
That woman used your sperm

00:18:29.775 --> 00:18:32.486
to scam the old man's inheritance.

00:18:32.486 --> 00:18:35.948
You were foolishly used,
yet you thought it was true love.

00:18:35.948 --> 00:18:39.618
Now that she's the chairman, what do you have?

00:18:39.618 --> 00:18:43.038
She doesn't even dare
to announce your relationship with her.

00:18:43.038 --> 00:18:47.425
The child's surname will still be Zhan, right?

00:18:48.544 --> 00:18:50.879
Just so you know.

00:18:50.879 --> 00:18:56.135
The estate trust has a 20-year restriction
on selling stocks and properties.

00:18:56.135 --> 00:18:58.387
In order to help me pay off my debts,

00:18:58.387 --> 00:19:00.931
she had to become the chairman.

00:19:00.931 --> 00:19:02.057
Whose fault is that?

00:19:02.057 --> 00:19:04.935
And you call yourself a famous psychiatrist.

00:19:04.935 --> 00:19:08.355
How could you believe her nonsense?

00:19:08.355 --> 00:19:10.566
Why would she give up her position?

00:19:10.566 --> 00:19:13.652
There's no way she'd run away with you?

00:19:13.652 --> 00:19:16.321
You're the delusional one.

00:19:16.321 --> 00:19:18.247
Get it straight.

00:19:19.283 --> 00:19:20.951
Let me remind you.

00:19:20.951 --> 00:19:24.079
Antidepressants will make your mouth dry.

00:19:24.079 --> 00:19:26.999
Remember to stay hydrated.

00:19:26.999 --> 00:19:29.175
Let's call it a day.

00:19:29.793 --> 00:19:31.170
It seems like

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:34.681
I can't leave this place for the time being.

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:40.220
If that's the case,
you can visit me every week.

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:43.314
This is Dr. Gu. We're done here, thanks.

00:19:44.975 --> 00:19:47.819
If you don't, I'll send the audio file out.

00:19:53.442 --> 00:19:55.360
After all, you're so sick.

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:58.162
I'm the only one who can save you.

00:20:03.035 --> 00:20:06.713
Have you ever thought about
how we ended up like this?

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:15.304
You tell me.

00:20:16.006 --> 00:20:18.842
We were so in love.

00:20:18.842 --> 00:20:21.887
We even said we'd go to New Zealand together.

00:20:21.887 --> 00:20:24.272
But you locked me up here.

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.150
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:20:27.851 --> 00:20:29.694
Feeling sorry for me?

00:20:50.207 --> 00:20:51.617
Give it to me.

00:20:54.836 --> 00:20:55.921
Vice President.

00:20:55.921 --> 00:20:57.798
I've been collecting more exposes online

00:20:57.798 --> 00:21:00.133
on Zhou Xiao Qi for money and murder.

00:21:00.133 --> 00:21:01.718
And the follow-up articles
in the weekly magazines.

00:21:01.718 --> 00:21:03.549
I've sorted them all out.

00:21:05.889 --> 00:21:08.058
Have you sent it to Old Chairman Wu?

00:21:08.058 --> 00:21:10.519
I sent it by courier this morning.

00:21:10.519 --> 00:21:12.361
This morning?

00:21:14.022 --> 00:21:17.325
I really can't do without your help,
my little assistant.

00:21:18.068 --> 00:21:20.161
Here, take a look.

00:21:20.779 --> 00:21:22.265
Look.

00:21:29.204 --> 00:21:31.832
This is very expensive.

00:21:31.832 --> 00:21:33.458
When I went out with you last time,

00:21:33.458 --> 00:21:35.127
I saw you staring at someone else.

00:21:35.127 --> 00:21:36.169
Listen.

00:21:36.169 --> 00:21:39.923
I can't stand it when my woman
is envious of others.

00:21:39.923 --> 00:21:42.141
Why are you so nice to me?

00:21:44.344 --> 00:21:48.056
Because it's your turn
to be nice to me tonight, alright?

00:21:52.436 --> 00:21:54.028
Come in.

00:21:57.065 --> 00:21:59.026
Xiao Qi.

00:21:59.026 --> 00:22:03.030
I've received Chairman Qian's proposal
for the board meeting.

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:05.957
They want to dismiss you as the chairman.

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.411
They can dismiss me at the board meeting?

00:22:09.411 --> 00:22:12.622
According to company law, they can.

00:22:12.622 --> 00:22:14.249
For such an important proposal,

00:22:14.249 --> 00:22:16.835
more than two-thirds of the directors
must be present.

00:22:16.835 --> 00:22:19.713
It can only be approved by a majority vote.

00:22:19.713 --> 00:22:21.757
So, there are nine seats in total.

00:22:21.757 --> 00:22:23.550
If fewer than six directors attend,

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:25.385
their proposal won't pass.

00:22:25.385 --> 00:22:26.470
That's right.

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:28.555
Who can we dissuade from attending?

00:22:28.555 --> 00:22:30.140
Among the nine directors,

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:33.746
we have you, Director You, and me.

00:22:33.746 --> 00:22:35.486
It's a total of three seats.

00:22:36.146 --> 00:22:37.397
If that's the case,

00:22:37.397 --> 00:22:40.650
if we can get just one
of the remaining six to not attend,

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:42.778
they won't be able to dismiss you.

00:22:42.778 --> 00:22:46.073
However, that one vote won't be easy.

00:22:46.073 --> 00:22:47.616
Chairman Qian has two seats.

00:22:47.616 --> 00:22:49.159
The union representative has one.

00:22:49.159 --> 00:22:50.202
And General Manager Huang has one.

00:22:50.202 --> 00:22:52.412
These four seats probably can't be swayed.

00:22:52.412 --> 00:22:56.416
The remaining two seats
are Old Chairman Wu and Chairman Lin.

00:22:56.416 --> 00:22:57.918
Who are they?

00:22:57.918 --> 00:23:00.087
Old Chairman Wu was the first chairman.

00:23:00.087 --> 00:23:02.339
More than 20 years ago, Hongfa was led by him,

00:23:02.339 --> 00:23:06.218
Chairman Zhan, General Manager Xin,
and General Manager Huang.

00:23:06.218 --> 00:23:08.637
You met Chairman Lin at your birthday party.

00:23:08.637 --> 00:23:11.147
Chairman Lin Xi Ming of Chaomai.

00:23:19.439 --> 00:23:20.948
Chairman Lin.

00:23:22.651 --> 00:23:24.619
Thank you for taking the time to come.

00:23:34.454 --> 00:23:37.340
I remember you like Oriental Beauty.

00:23:48.802 --> 00:23:50.686
It smells good.

00:23:56.935 --> 00:23:58.736
It's good tea.

00:24:00.021 --> 00:24:04.784
I got this for you at Sotheby's last month.

00:24:16.163 --> 00:24:18.214
You're too kind.

00:24:18.874 --> 00:24:22.627
I'd like to ask you for a favor today.

00:24:22.627 --> 00:24:23.795
Go ahead.

00:24:23.795 --> 00:24:26.131
I hope you can continue to support me

00:24:26.131 --> 00:24:28.391
as chairman of Hongfa.

00:24:30.343 --> 00:24:33.221
Since you're so straightforward,

00:24:33.221 --> 00:24:35.682
I'll get straight to the point.

00:24:35.682 --> 00:24:38.185
When General Manager Xin asked me to invest,

00:24:38.185 --> 00:24:42.147
it was to promote a strategic alliance
between Chaomai and Hongfa.

00:24:42.147 --> 00:24:45.984
Who knew that after
Zhan Qian Ren became chairman,

00:24:45.984 --> 00:24:48.361
he'd give me such a hard time.

00:24:48.361 --> 00:24:50.538
It's giving me a headache.

00:24:55.202 --> 00:24:58.538
Mr. Zhan wants you to be his successor.

00:24:58.538 --> 00:25:04.093
So, please tell me, why should I support you?

00:25:06.421 --> 00:25:08.139
There isn't any reason for you to do so.

00:25:08.924 --> 00:25:11.851
If I were you, I probably
wouldn't support myself either.

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:16.765
But I'm not like Qian Ren.

00:25:16.765 --> 00:25:20.602
Qian Ren's era of domination is over.

00:25:20.602 --> 00:25:24.022
What matters now is cooperation and scale.

00:25:24.022 --> 00:25:27.234
So, as long as you support me
in remaining as the chairman,

00:25:27.234 --> 00:25:29.444
I'll reinstate the strategic alliance.

00:25:29.444 --> 00:25:32.781
So, you want me to miss the board meeting?

00:25:32.781 --> 00:25:34.741
Yes.

00:25:34.741 --> 00:25:36.993
If you don't attend this board meeting,

00:25:36.993 --> 00:25:40.205
I promise to exchange shares with Chaomai

00:25:40.205 --> 00:25:43.542
by issuing new shares
at Hongfa's board meeting.

00:25:43.542 --> 00:25:45.919
This way, both of
our shareholdings will increase.

00:25:45.919 --> 00:25:48.004
A further collaboration like this

00:25:48.004 --> 00:25:50.799
can be considered a public pledge.

00:25:50.799 --> 00:25:54.545
I think it'll be very popular in the market.

00:25:58.265 --> 00:26:00.684
No wonder you're Mr. Zhan's successor.

00:26:00.684 --> 00:26:04.737
What do you think, Chairman Lin?

00:28:15.485 --> 00:28:18.238
To the right! To the right!

00:28:18.238 --> 00:28:19.914
Darn it!

00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:25.245
Hurry!

00:28:25.245 --> 00:28:26.580
Speed past!

00:28:28.373 --> 00:28:30.466
Don't block me! Don't!

00:28:31.459 --> 00:28:33.177
Yes!

00:28:35.213 --> 00:28:37.097
Crap!

00:28:37.966 --> 00:28:41.810
You have to brake when you turn!

00:28:44.055 --> 00:28:45.689
The button here.

00:28:55.608 --> 00:28:57.861
You're back.

00:28:57.861 --> 00:28:59.703
Have you eaten?

00:29:31.311 --> 00:29:33.153
Your birthday present.

00:29:34.272 --> 00:29:38.117
It's a limited edition item
from your favorite team.

00:29:40.653 --> 00:29:42.697
Thanks.

00:29:42.697 --> 00:29:44.290
Eat up.

00:29:49.579 --> 00:29:51.498
Do you want some?

00:29:51.498 --> 00:29:53.090
Thank you.

00:30:02.467 --> 00:30:05.644
I heard from Uncle Li that you went to see him.

00:30:06.513 --> 00:30:08.105
Yes.

00:30:10.016 --> 00:30:12.268
He said he was going to invest.

00:30:12.268 --> 00:30:13.895
Why didn't you want it?

00:30:13.895 --> 00:30:16.447
I want to find a more suitable investor.

00:30:18.608 --> 00:30:20.109
If you need me...

00:30:20.109 --> 00:30:22.036
- I'll find one for you.
- There's no need.

00:30:24.447 --> 00:30:26.248
I have my own ways.

00:30:54.811 --> 00:30:58.356
The birthday feast is ready.

00:30:58.356 --> 00:31:01.533
Tomato scrambled eggs.

00:31:03.444 --> 00:31:05.613
Even though your birthday is over,

00:31:05.613 --> 00:31:07.574
as long as we're together,

00:31:07.574 --> 00:31:09.325
and live each day earnestly,

00:31:09.325 --> 00:31:12.287
it's more important than any holiday.

00:31:12.287 --> 00:31:13.913
As long as you're with me.

00:31:13.913 --> 00:31:15.923
Of course.

00:31:17.333 --> 00:31:20.003
I love you.

00:31:20.003 --> 00:31:21.629
Whether you succeed or fail,

00:31:21.629 --> 00:31:24.348
whether you have money or not,
that's not important.

00:31:33.558 --> 00:31:35.234
What is it?

00:31:38.396 --> 00:31:40.072
Why so mysterious?

00:31:41.357 --> 00:31:43.109
Happy birthday.

00:31:43.109 --> 00:31:44.777
No way.

00:31:44.777 --> 00:31:46.412
There's a present too?

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:54.329
Although this wallet is empty now,

00:31:54.329 --> 00:31:55.705
as long as we work together,

00:31:55.705 --> 00:31:58.549
I'm sure we can fill it up in no time.

00:31:59.334 --> 00:32:03.095
Every dollar in it will be yours.

00:32:26.903 --> 00:32:28.454
Thank you.

00:32:30.949 --> 00:32:32.367
Let's eat.

00:32:32.367 --> 00:32:35.578
Wait, there's one more thing missing.

00:32:35.578 --> 00:32:37.171
What is it?

00:32:37.914 --> 00:32:39.290
Make a wish.

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:40.625
I used to make wishes for you.

00:32:40.625 --> 00:32:42.085
Now it's your turn to make one for me.

00:32:42.085 --> 00:32:43.753
No, you're so childish.

00:32:43.753 --> 00:32:45.088
Hands out.

00:32:45.088 --> 00:32:46.339
You're the childish one.

00:32:46.339 --> 00:32:47.840
Give me your hand.

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:49.475
Hurry up.

00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:53.137
Wiggle them.

00:32:53.137 --> 00:32:54.681
Sing.

00:32:54.681 --> 00:32:56.724
Happy birthday to you.

00:32:56.724 --> 00:32:58.059
Louder.

00:32:58.059 --> 00:33:00.645
Happy birthday to you.

00:33:00.645 --> 00:33:03.481
Happy birthday to you.

00:33:03.481 --> 00:33:06.275
Happy birthday to you

00:33:06.275 --> 00:33:08.236
- I want to make a wish.
- Happy birthday to you.

00:33:08.236 --> 00:33:10.405
Happy birthday to you.

00:33:10.405 --> 00:33:13.074
Happy birthday to you.

00:33:13.074 --> 00:33:15.910
Happy birthday to you.

00:33:15.910 --> 00:33:20.005
- Wait. Don't go over there.
- Put your hand down.

00:33:37.348 --> 00:33:38.950
Come in.

00:33:40.643 --> 00:33:43.604
Old Chairman Wu's secretary just called.

00:33:43.604 --> 00:33:45.189
What did he say?

00:33:45.189 --> 00:33:47.233
Old Chairman Wu said

00:33:47.233 --> 00:33:48.943
if we want to talk about the board meeting,

00:33:48.943 --> 00:33:52.405
we can just discuss it during the meeting.

00:33:52.405 --> 00:33:55.783
He has always respected
Mr. Zhan's last wish and supported you.

00:33:55.783 --> 00:33:57.869
But he won't see you now.

00:33:57.869 --> 00:34:01.414
His attitude has changed so much.

00:34:01.414 --> 00:34:04.341
I think it has something to do with the rumors.

00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:11.966
The board meeting is tomorrow.

00:34:11.966 --> 00:34:14.343
Chairman You said he's been
calling Old Chairman Wu's cellphone,

00:34:14.343 --> 00:34:15.803
but he didn't pick up.

00:34:15.803 --> 00:34:17.938
He will try again.

00:34:18.806 --> 00:34:21.692
If Old Chairman Wu remains so resolute,

00:34:23.561 --> 00:34:25.772
we can only count on Chairman Lin.

00:34:25.772 --> 00:34:29.491
But the private relationship
between Chairman Lin and Chairman Qian

00:34:30.485 --> 00:34:32.744
is what worries me the most.

00:34:37.033 --> 00:34:38.701
Chairman Lin.

00:34:38.701 --> 00:34:40.661
What did Zhou Xiao Qi offer you

00:34:40.661 --> 00:34:42.921
for you to miss the board meeting?

00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:45.875
If I become the chairman,

00:34:45.875 --> 00:34:49.837
what Zhou Xiao Qi can give you,
I can give you, too.

00:34:49.837 --> 00:34:51.513
She said...

00:34:52.715 --> 00:34:55.927
she's going to form
a strategic alliance with Chaomai.

00:34:55.927 --> 00:34:58.763
She also promised to issue new shares

00:34:58.763 --> 00:35:01.224
and swap them with Chaomai.

00:35:01.224 --> 00:35:03.518
We'll both increase our holdings.

00:35:03.518 --> 00:35:07.571
Isn't this what you and Old Xin
wanted to do back then?

00:35:09.148 --> 00:35:10.149
Yes.

00:35:10.149 --> 00:35:14.987
Even if Zhou Xiao Qi doesn't do it, I'll do it.

00:35:14.987 --> 00:35:16.531
As long as Zhou Xiao Qi steps down,

00:35:16.531 --> 00:35:18.366
and I become the chairman,

00:35:18.366 --> 00:35:22.578
I'll appoint you as Hongfa's Vice Chairman.

00:35:22.578 --> 00:35:25.998
This way, you'll be both Hongfa's Vice Chairman

00:35:25.998 --> 00:35:28.376
and Chaomai's Chairman.

00:35:28.376 --> 00:35:31.553
Isn't that one step closer to your dream?

00:35:43.975 --> 00:35:46.227
Chairman Lin.

00:35:46.227 --> 00:35:50.566
Please attend Hongfa's board meeting.

00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:01.833
I'll drink to that.

00:36:23.639 --> 00:36:25.183
Any word from Chairman Lin?

00:36:25.183 --> 00:36:27.226
I just contacted his secretary.

00:36:27.226 --> 00:36:29.103
Chairman Lin is still considering it.

00:36:29.103 --> 00:36:30.438
What about Old Chairman Wu?

00:36:30.438 --> 00:36:34.275
Abla said Old Chairman Wu won't see him either.

00:36:34.275 --> 00:36:35.909
Okay.

00:37:28.621 --> 00:37:30.255
Thank you.

00:37:35.211 --> 00:37:37.421
Hello, I'm Zhou Xiao Qi from Hongfa.

00:37:37.421 --> 00:37:40.174
Please tell Old Chairman Wu I need to see him.

00:37:40.174 --> 00:37:43.511
The chairman is having lunch.
It's not a good time.

00:37:43.511 --> 00:37:45.554
I can wait for him to finish.
Just five minutes.

00:37:45.554 --> 00:37:48.523
He really can't see anyone now.

00:38:22.008 --> 00:38:23.517
Good afternoon.

00:38:27.763 --> 00:38:29.242
Have a seat.

00:38:51.245 --> 00:38:52.288
Chairman.

00:38:52.288 --> 00:38:53.644
Chairman Lin is here.

00:38:53.644 --> 00:38:55.298
We don't have much time.

00:38:57.626 --> 00:39:00.212
Hello, Old Chairman Wu.
I'm Zhou Xiao Qi from Hongfa.

00:39:00.212 --> 00:39:03.257
What's written in the magazine
is not true. May I explain?

00:39:03.257 --> 00:39:06.393
Let's talk about it
at the board meeting, alright?

00:39:11.515 --> 00:39:13.684
Old Chairman Wu.

00:39:13.684 --> 00:39:15.519
Please give our chairman a chance to explain.

00:39:15.519 --> 00:39:17.938
It's really not what you think.

00:39:17.938 --> 00:39:19.322
Old Chairman Wu.

00:39:29.408 --> 00:39:31.334
What are you doing?

00:39:31.994 --> 00:39:35.081
I just need you to give me a chance to explain.

00:39:35.081 --> 00:39:36.707
I don't think that's necessary.

00:39:36.707 --> 00:39:38.417
Let's talk when you get up.

00:39:38.417 --> 00:39:40.294
What's written in the magazine is not true.

00:39:40.294 --> 00:39:42.846
I hope you don't believe
the unscrupulous media.

00:39:43.631 --> 00:39:46.092
Of course, I know the media can't be trusted.

00:39:46.092 --> 00:39:48.135
But where there's smoke, there's fire.

00:39:48.135 --> 00:39:50.096
Where did those rumors
within the company come from?

00:39:50.096 --> 00:39:52.515
It's because they want to oust me.

00:39:52.515 --> 00:39:55.059
So, they maliciously slandered me
and spread rumors.

00:39:55.059 --> 00:39:57.144
Do you have proof?

00:39:57.144 --> 00:39:58.771
No.

00:39:58.771 --> 00:40:01.531
But I can prove that they're lying.

00:40:05.069 --> 00:40:08.747
This is my husband,
Zhan Qian Ren's death certificate.

00:40:09.615 --> 00:40:12.743
He really died of acute myocardial infarction.

00:40:12.743 --> 00:40:16.755
A few months ago,
he underwent surgery for this.

00:40:17.957 --> 00:40:19.708
He survived.

00:40:19.708 --> 00:40:21.683
But this time...

00:40:27.758 --> 00:40:30.177
No matter what,

00:40:30.177 --> 00:40:33.730
I'll protect his company with my life.

00:40:35.182 --> 00:40:38.109
It's the only thing he left me and our child.

00:40:39.019 --> 00:40:41.137
Old Chairman Wu, please.

00:40:50.781 --> 00:40:52.374
All right.

00:40:53.409 --> 00:40:56.328
I won't attend the board meeting today.

00:40:56.328 --> 00:40:59.081
Get up. You're pregnant.

00:40:59.081 --> 00:41:00.624
Thank you, Old Chairman Wu.

00:41:00.624 --> 00:41:02.501
Thank you, Old Chairman Wu.

00:41:02.501 --> 00:41:04.253
You don't have to thank me.

00:41:04.253 --> 00:41:06.385
At the shareholders' meeting in a few months,

00:41:06.385 --> 00:41:07.923
the board members will be reelected.

00:41:07.923 --> 00:41:10.342
As one of the company's founders,

00:41:10.342 --> 00:41:12.136
I'm also responsible for the shareholders.

00:41:12.136 --> 00:41:14.555
As for whether you're fit
to run this company,

00:41:14.555 --> 00:41:18.483
it will depend on your performance.

00:41:20.269 --> 00:41:22.021
I understand.

00:41:22.021 --> 00:41:23.397
Thank you, Old Chairman Wu.

00:41:23.397 --> 00:41:24.990
Thank you, Old Chairman Wu.

00:41:39.955 --> 00:41:43.334
I didn't expect Zhou Xiao Qi
to stop Old Chairman Wu.

00:41:43.334 --> 00:41:45.085
I underestimated her.

00:41:45.085 --> 00:41:46.795
She knelt down!

00:41:46.795 --> 00:41:48.672
My goodness.

00:41:48.672 --> 00:41:50.966
She pulled off such a sensational act.

00:41:50.966 --> 00:41:52.384
She really is a tough cookie.

00:41:52.384 --> 00:41:55.103
I'm starting to admire her.

00:41:57.181 --> 00:41:58.224
Sis, you know what?

00:41:58.224 --> 00:42:00.601
Lin Xi Ming's wife called me yesterday.

00:42:00.601 --> 00:42:03.312
She said Yi Fu had a blind date.

00:42:03.312 --> 00:42:04.605
But he stood her up.

00:42:04.605 --> 00:42:06.857
I've been apologizing nonstop.

00:42:06.857 --> 00:42:08.108
When you have the time,

00:42:08.108 --> 00:42:12.071
get Yi Fu to meet Lin Feng Hua again.

00:42:12.071 --> 00:42:15.324
Does Lin Xi Ming want to merge the company

00:42:15.324 --> 00:42:16.700
or marry off his daughter?

00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:19.912
Chairman Lin only has one daughter,
and you only have one son.

00:42:19.912 --> 00:42:23.465
Aren't we talking about the same thing?

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:27.920
In terms of business,

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:32.091
although we can't form
a strategic alliance with Chairman Lin yet,

00:42:32.091 --> 00:42:36.353
a personal alliance is still possible.

00:42:38.055 --> 00:42:40.307
But Yi Fu...

00:42:40.307 --> 00:42:42.726
I think Yi Fu is tired of Pan Xin Tong now.

00:42:42.726 --> 00:42:44.061
Now is the best time

00:42:44.061 --> 00:42:46.230
to seamlessly transition to Lin Feng Hua.

00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:48.281
It's perfect, isn't it?

00:42:49.525 --> 00:42:52.152
I'm not so sure anymore.

00:42:52.152 --> 00:42:57.199
Yi Fu seems different this time.

00:42:57.199 --> 00:42:59.834
Is Pan Xin Tong that charming?

00:43:01.287 --> 00:43:04.297
No matter how good she is, I won't agree to it.

00:43:06.333 --> 00:43:09.044
But Yi Fu has been back for a few days.

00:43:09.044 --> 00:43:13.257
My relationship with him
has finally mellowed out.

00:43:13.257 --> 00:43:16.142
I don't want to fight with him
over this anymore.

00:43:16.802 --> 00:43:18.053
Okay.

00:43:18.053 --> 00:43:20.681
Sis, don't worry.

00:43:20.681 --> 00:43:23.900
Leave this to me.

00:44:00.721 --> 00:44:03.603
I'm sorry about the other day.

00:44:08.145 --> 00:44:10.238
How did it go with Xin Tong?

00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:14.088
It was fine.

00:44:18.405 --> 00:44:20.603
What are you going to do now?

00:44:23.452 --> 00:44:25.044
I don't know.

00:44:25.913 --> 00:44:27.881
Get a job.

00:44:29.458 --> 00:44:31.210
A job?

00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:33.754
Do you think a few thousand dollars
a month is enough?

00:44:33.754 --> 00:44:34.838
This is nonsensical.

00:44:34.838 --> 00:44:36.215
Apologize to your mom.

00:44:36.215 --> 00:44:37.682
No way.

00:44:38.592 --> 00:44:40.310
It's so embarrassing.

00:44:46.308 --> 00:44:48.268
Thank you.

00:44:48.268 --> 00:44:49.561
Why are you here?

00:44:49.561 --> 00:44:53.023
Your mom wants to
partner with Chaomai's Chairman Lin.

00:44:53.023 --> 00:44:54.525
They'll use a different concept

00:44:54.525 --> 00:44:58.036
to open a few different department stores.

00:44:59.363 --> 00:45:01.031
Why does she want to do that all of a sudden?

00:45:01.031 --> 00:45:05.577
She wants to work with Chaomai
to create a new model.

00:45:05.577 --> 00:45:08.580
The kind that's guaranteed to be successful.

00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:11.667
Do you know that once your mom
gets Hongfa's management rights,

00:45:11.667 --> 00:45:15.887
she can launch a strategic alliance
between three companies.

00:45:17.297 --> 00:45:19.591
I remember you said

00:45:19.591 --> 00:45:23.512
you wanted to open a cosmetics
and coffee fusion store, right?

00:45:23.512 --> 00:45:26.814
It's great. You can do it.

00:45:31.061 --> 00:45:33.188
Okay, I get it.

00:45:33.188 --> 00:45:37.735
You want to start a business to prove
your capability to your mom, right?

00:45:37.735 --> 00:45:39.528
But be honest with yourself.

00:45:39.528 --> 00:45:41.739
Is the process going well?

00:45:41.739 --> 00:45:44.616
Are you kidding me? Capitalism is so cruel.

00:45:44.616 --> 00:45:47.411
You have no money or connections.
How can you succeed?

00:45:47.411 --> 00:45:49.121
Do you want to make a fool out of me?

00:45:49.121 --> 00:45:50.539
Do you think you look funny?

00:45:50.539 --> 00:45:51.721
Why would your mom laugh at you?

00:45:51.721 --> 00:45:53.542
Your mom loves you.

00:45:53.542 --> 00:45:55.127
Do you know that because of this,

00:45:55.127 --> 00:45:56.523
your mom was worried about your reputation,

00:45:56.523 --> 00:45:58.505
so she asked me, your uncle, to speak to you.

00:45:58.505 --> 00:46:01.175
Do you think I have nothing better to do?

00:46:01.175 --> 00:46:03.802
Your mom is not as cold-blooded as you think.

00:46:03.802 --> 00:46:05.395
She even...

00:46:07.431 --> 00:46:10.483
She even needs you more than you think.

00:46:15.355 --> 00:46:17.191
Do you know...

00:46:17.191 --> 00:46:20.076
Xiao Qi used her ultimate trick today.

00:46:21.195 --> 00:46:24.239
She's pregnant, but she knelt down!

00:46:24.239 --> 00:46:26.074
She almost scared me to death.

00:46:26.074 --> 00:46:28.535
Luckily, she used this trick.

00:46:28.535 --> 00:46:31.580
She succeeded and retained
her position as chairman.

00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:33.923
Qian Li Hua must be furious.

00:46:40.005 --> 00:46:42.140
I didn't mean it that way.

00:46:43.884 --> 00:46:47.270
I don't mind. I'm happy for you, too.

00:46:50.474 --> 00:46:52.351
Really?

00:46:52.351 --> 00:46:55.020
It's one thing for me to upset your mom,

00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:57.940
but I even stood up to her for Xiao Qi.

00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:00.992
I'm afraid you'll be caught in the middle.

00:47:01.985 --> 00:47:03.620
I won't.

00:47:06.073 --> 00:47:07.624
Xin Tong.

00:47:09.326 --> 00:47:11.002
If...

00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:16.625
If I go back to Snoopy's, would you mind?

00:47:16.625 --> 00:47:18.544
You want to go back?

00:47:18.544 --> 00:47:20.678
Do you think I'm lame?

00:47:21.505 --> 00:47:23.131
I've been out for a while.

00:47:23.131 --> 00:47:25.183
I've lost all my money.

00:47:26.176 --> 00:47:28.186
I guess I still have to go back.

00:47:29.263 --> 00:47:33.183
Do you want to go back,
or is your mom forcing you to do so?

00:47:33.183 --> 00:47:34.859
She isn't.

00:47:35.477 --> 00:47:37.604
My mom should know it's useless
to force me into anything.

00:47:37.604 --> 00:47:40.691
She let me decide this time.

00:47:40.691 --> 00:47:42.659
Actually, I'm worried...

00:47:43.777 --> 00:47:45.787
you'll object.

00:47:46.405 --> 00:47:48.490
Why would I object?

00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:50.367
I'm Xiao Qi's chief secretary.

00:47:50.367 --> 00:47:52.077
That's your mom.

00:47:52.077 --> 00:47:55.672
We're just doing what we should, aren't we?

00:47:57.624 --> 00:47:59.039
Yes.

00:48:00.502 --> 00:48:02.212
But we have to make a vow.

00:48:02.212 --> 00:48:05.723
We can't let our differences
affect our relationship.

00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:12.071
I swear.

00:48:26.028 --> 00:48:27.988
Welcome. Do you have a reservation?

00:48:27.988 --> 00:48:29.156
Mr. Gu. Table for two.

00:48:29.156 --> 00:48:30.699
He's already here. This way.

00:48:30.699 --> 00:48:32.291
Thank you.

00:48:37.998 --> 00:48:39.966
Sorry, the meeting ran late.

00:48:40.792 --> 00:48:42.169
Are you hungry?

00:48:42.169 --> 00:48:44.087
I'm okay. Let's have a salad.

00:48:44.087 --> 00:48:45.422
Okay.

00:48:45.422 --> 00:48:48.099
There's seafood salad here.

00:48:51.678 --> 00:48:53.521
I'm going to the restroom.

00:49:02.028 --> 00:49:06.083
[Let's go elsewhere.
See you at the parking lot.]
