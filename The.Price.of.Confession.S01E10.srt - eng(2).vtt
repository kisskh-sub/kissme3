A video of the sexual assault
of Kang So-mang has gone viral.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.621
The video was confirmed
to have been sent indiscriminately

00:00:58.705 --> 00:01:01.082
to Kang's family and all of her contacts

00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:03.126
on the day of the incident.

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:07.422
The Ilsan teen murder case victim
was found to have distributed the video.

00:01:07.505 --> 00:01:09.632
-Stay still.
-I said don't!

00:01:09.716 --> 00:01:12.051
…has issued Protective Detention No. 5.

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:17.140
Moreover, there's a serious allegation
in the recent video leak…

00:01:17.223 --> 00:01:20.560
Mo was indicted for the murder
of the Ilsan dentist couple

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.521
and is now also under suspicion

00:01:23.605 --> 00:01:27.066
of killing their son, Ko Se-hun,
the defendant in Kang's case.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.944
Meanwhile, some have raised suspicions
that Kang's video…

00:01:30.028 --> 00:01:31.779
It looks like Inmate 407 is awake.

00:01:31.863 --> 00:01:34.824
…as an act of retaliation
against Mo and her family.

00:01:36.326 --> 00:01:37.327
Inmate 407!

00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:01.726
This is where we lost her.

00:02:02.227 --> 00:02:04.854
We're checking the CCTV cameras
around the hospital,

00:02:04.938 --> 00:02:08.149
but since it was morning rush hour,
it's hard to track her down.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:09.943
We've lost her.

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.655
I didn't think she'd be this bold.

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:15.573
She's changed.

00:02:16.241 --> 00:02:17.450
Nothing has changed.

00:02:17.951 --> 00:02:19.661
An Yun-su has been a murderer

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.871
since the day we met her.

00:02:24.082 --> 00:02:25.333
Let's see the files.

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:29.587
You made it.

00:02:29.671 --> 00:02:30.838
-Hi.
-Take a seat here.

00:02:30.922 --> 00:02:35.969
Right. I was told five o'clock,
but I see you've already started.

00:02:36.844 --> 00:02:41.766
It's the Ministry of Justice's orders.
We also have a duty to locate An Yun-su.

00:02:42.433 --> 00:02:45.770
But you neglected your duty
to monitor her, didn't you?

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:50.775
Let's see the files.

00:02:51.401 --> 00:02:53.027
Was the digital camera restored?

00:02:53.111 --> 00:02:54.821
I think it'll take some time.

00:02:56.114 --> 00:02:57.323
What about Mo Eun?

00:02:57.407 --> 00:02:59.158
Fortunately, the surgery went well.

00:03:00.076 --> 00:03:02.620
Well, I'm not sure
"fortunately" is the right word.

00:03:02.704 --> 00:03:07.208
Has the intruder
in An Yun-su's house been identified?

00:03:08.835 --> 00:03:11.170
It was Ko Dong-uk,
Ko Se-hun's grandfather.

00:03:11.713 --> 00:03:14.966
And he was also the one
who stabbed Mo Eun at the hospital?

00:03:16.884 --> 00:03:20.555
If we act rashly against him,
the media won't let it slide.

00:03:20.638 --> 00:03:23.016
He's a bereaved man who's lost his family.

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.852
-And that's how resentful he is.
-He's resentful, indeed.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.398
So much that he wouldn't hold the funeral
until the killer was caught.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.862
Once we catch An Yun-su,

00:03:37.113 --> 00:03:39.073
things will fall back into place.

00:03:39.741 --> 00:03:43.786
Until then, we need your cooperation
in tracking down An Yun-su.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.711
ILSAN TEEN MURDER TASK FORCE

00:03:51.794 --> 00:03:52.920
Far more than expected--

00:03:54.672 --> 00:03:56.424
I didn't know the TV was on.

00:04:02.388 --> 00:04:04.557
This is nothing compared to being stabbed.

00:04:13.107 --> 00:04:16.235
If I were you, I wouldn't have gone
into the electrical room.

00:04:16.944 --> 00:04:18.446
It was for An Yun-su, wasn't it?

00:04:21.074 --> 00:04:22.825
The police must be searching for her.

00:04:23.326 --> 00:04:26.120
But they don't give a damn
about the one with the knife.

00:04:26.621 --> 00:04:27.580
That pisses me off.

00:04:35.463 --> 00:04:36.923
So who was it?

00:04:38.299 --> 00:04:40.343
Who hit me and stabbed you?

00:04:41.427 --> 00:04:43.096
You must've seen their face.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.940
GYEONGGI BUKBU PROVINCIAL POLICE

00:05:05.243 --> 00:05:07.203
Let's start over from the hospital.

00:05:07.286 --> 00:05:09.914
Don't go by appearance.
Track anyone suspicious.

00:05:09.997 --> 00:05:11.207
Yes, ma'am.

00:05:25.471 --> 00:05:26.556
"Hong Se-yeong."

00:05:33.646 --> 00:05:36.274
Mr. Baek. To what do I owe the pleasure?

00:05:36.774 --> 00:05:38.568
Where did you get the story?

00:05:38.651 --> 00:05:39.485
Which story?

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.239
You had the exclusive
on Ko Se-hun's past case too.

00:05:43.322 --> 00:05:45.158
Tell me. Who gave it to you?

00:05:45.241 --> 00:05:46.701
Oh, that…

00:05:47.618 --> 00:05:51.122
I tried asking,
but they wanted to remain anonymous.

00:05:51.205 --> 00:05:53.416
The call was from a restricted number.

00:05:53.916 --> 00:05:55.376
I'm actually curious myself.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.504
They leaked information,
acting like a whistleblower.

00:05:58.588 --> 00:06:00.047
For some reason,

00:06:00.548 --> 00:06:02.341
I feel like it's personal.

00:06:02.425 --> 00:06:04.260
-Was it a woman?
-No, a man.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.473
He's not just a tipster, is he?

00:06:09.182 --> 00:06:12.685
Since you asked if it was a woman,
you must be thinking of An Yun-su, right?

00:06:14.187 --> 00:06:17.398
-Send me a screenshot of the call log.
-Sure, I'll do that.

00:06:17.482 --> 00:06:20.568
But if you find out who it is,
let me know too, okay?

00:06:28.284 --> 00:06:30.828
An emergency call was made
from An Yun-su's phone.

00:06:32.205 --> 00:06:34.373
-What's the location?
-Ko Dong-uk's house.

00:06:40.796 --> 00:06:41.631
Hello?

00:06:41.714 --> 00:06:44.091
Are you in danger right now?

00:06:45.218 --> 00:06:46.636
Please help me.

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:48.888
Can you tell me your location?

00:06:49.388 --> 00:06:51.849
If Ko Dong-uk's done something
to An Yun-su,

00:06:52.725 --> 00:06:53.559
what do we do?

00:06:54.143 --> 00:06:55.228
Then we should resign,

00:06:55.811 --> 00:06:58.439
since that old man was able to find her
before we could.

00:07:30.471 --> 00:07:32.056
Come in.

00:07:52.785 --> 00:07:53.744
Hello?

00:07:53.828 --> 00:07:56.080
Are you in danger right now?

00:07:58.082 --> 00:07:59.542
Please help me.

00:08:00.042 --> 00:08:02.169
Can you tell me your location?

00:08:04.338 --> 00:08:05.256
Hello?

00:08:06.757 --> 00:08:07.883
Ma'am?

00:08:11.345 --> 00:08:13.806
This is the 112 call
made from An Yun-su's phone.

00:08:13.889 --> 00:08:16.017
The signal shows she's still here.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:17.810
Where is she?

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:20.313
Are you saying

00:08:21.188 --> 00:08:23.024
I did something to her?

00:08:27.153 --> 00:08:28.654
Where were you early on the 13th?

00:08:28.738 --> 00:08:32.033
I always take my dog for a walk
early in the morning.

00:08:32.116 --> 00:08:33.784
Did anyone see you?

00:08:34.744 --> 00:08:36.078
Go to the park.

00:08:36.662 --> 00:08:39.457
Someone there would've recognized General.

00:08:40.374 --> 00:08:42.918
You also went to An Yun-su's house
late on the 12th.

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:46.255
Yes. I rang the doorbell.

00:08:46.756 --> 00:08:48.507
She opened the door, so I went in.

00:08:48.591 --> 00:08:52.011
Then there was a struggle,
and she ran away.

00:08:53.346 --> 00:08:56.349
She's suspected of killing my grandson.

00:08:56.849 --> 00:08:58.309
I went to ask about it.

00:08:58.976 --> 00:09:01.479
But she panicked for no reason
and ran off.

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:04.065
How did you find her?

00:09:05.232 --> 00:09:06.233
How did you know?

00:09:07.401 --> 00:09:10.488
It was before she was named
as a suspect on the news.

00:09:13.366 --> 00:09:16.619
Who told you, and what did they say?

00:09:21.165 --> 00:09:22.792
We found An Yun-su's phone!

00:09:32.635 --> 00:09:34.553
It doesn't have a passcode.

00:10:26.313 --> 00:10:28.190
She came of her own accord.

00:10:31.902 --> 00:10:34.572
She stayed for about 20 minutes.

00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:38.284
Why would she have come here?

00:10:59.138 --> 00:11:02.099
Does this mean I'm in the clear now?

00:11:08.481 --> 00:11:09.565
Sir.

00:11:10.566 --> 00:11:11.650
Is anything missing?

00:11:12.735 --> 00:11:13.736
No.

00:11:13.819 --> 00:11:15.279
Please tell me the truth.

00:11:15.362 --> 00:11:16.697
Nothing's missing.

00:11:18.157 --> 00:11:19.492
Is this how it's going to be?

00:11:20.701 --> 00:11:23.913
The same person who ran from you days ago
came here voluntarily.

00:11:25.456 --> 00:11:28.209
She even led the investigation team here.

00:11:34.882 --> 00:11:35.758
Who was it?

00:11:36.926 --> 00:11:39.470
Who told you An Yun-su killed Ko Se-hun?

00:11:42.681 --> 00:11:44.767
And who told you
Mo Eun was in the hospital?

00:11:52.358 --> 00:11:54.318
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:12:06.497 --> 00:12:07.498
Sir.

00:12:14.463 --> 00:12:15.297
This jacket.

00:12:18.259 --> 00:12:19.593
Can I go out for a smoke?

00:12:20.302 --> 00:12:23.639
DAEHO BOXING GYM

00:12:26.684 --> 00:12:32.523
DAEHO BOXING GYM

00:12:40.489 --> 00:12:42.908
Lots of traces over there.
Try that spot first.

00:12:58.090 --> 00:12:59.008
What happened?

00:13:01.677 --> 00:13:03.512
You didn't know where she was?

00:13:03.596 --> 00:13:05.598
When you've provided her
with this hideout?

00:13:05.681 --> 00:13:06.849
I didn't know.

00:13:06.932 --> 00:13:08.350
I haven't been here in a year.

00:13:08.434 --> 00:13:10.895
Then how did An Yun-su know to come here?

00:13:11.729 --> 00:13:14.148
I mentioned it once,
and she somehow found it.

00:13:14.732 --> 00:13:15.733
Take a look up here.

00:13:16.483 --> 00:13:17.860
See what she has done.

00:13:34.543 --> 00:13:35.794
What is this?

00:13:37.004 --> 00:13:38.047
What do you think?

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:44.845
Did she paint the murder scene?

00:13:44.929 --> 00:13:47.973
She painted it for us to see,
as if she's showing off her crime.

00:13:49.558 --> 00:13:51.852
-I'm sure there's a reason, so--
-What reason?

00:13:52.603 --> 00:13:55.272
What does this painting show,
other than a dead Ko Se-hun?

00:13:55.356 --> 00:13:57.942
-Maybe she wants to tell us--
-Wake up.

00:14:00.319 --> 00:14:03.155
This is An Yun-su's phone.
We found it at Ko Dong-uk's house.

00:14:04.198 --> 00:14:05.032
Here.

00:14:08.702 --> 00:14:10.663
THIS IS WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING?
YOU DON'T HAVE TIME

00:14:10.746 --> 00:14:11.664
Do you get it now?

00:14:13.666 --> 00:14:14.541
It can't be.

00:14:27.346 --> 00:14:29.556
SENDER: AN YUN-SU

00:14:35.813 --> 00:14:38.357
Is this An Yun-su's number?

00:14:50.619 --> 00:14:51.620
These are

00:14:52.121 --> 00:14:54.873
all clues that point
to her killing Ko Se-hun.

00:14:54.957 --> 00:14:55.958
No.

00:14:57.001 --> 00:14:59.586
Someone could've sent this
pretending to be Ms. An.

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:01.630
All of these photos are of her.

00:15:01.714 --> 00:15:04.550
We don't know who took them
or where they came from--

00:15:04.633 --> 00:15:07.094
Did someone paint that
pretending to be her too?

00:15:07.678 --> 00:15:09.013
But it doesn't add up.

00:15:09.096 --> 00:15:11.598
Until recently,
she's been saying it wasn't her--

00:15:11.682 --> 00:15:13.183
What more do we need?

00:15:13.267 --> 00:15:16.311
There's already ample evidence
that An Yun-su is the killer.

00:15:16.395 --> 00:15:18.897
She knows I didn't do it.

00:15:18.981 --> 00:15:21.775
And she knew Ko Se-hun was dead
before I did.

00:15:21.859 --> 00:15:23.694
Please go see Mo Eun.

00:15:26.905 --> 00:15:28.198
I want to see Mo Eun.

00:15:29.658 --> 00:15:31.076
Let me see her.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:32.202
You can't.

00:15:32.286 --> 00:15:34.872
And I'm sure you know exactly why.

00:15:34.955 --> 00:15:36.498
No, I actually don't.

00:15:37.082 --> 00:15:38.792
Why is Ms. An suddenly doing this?

00:15:38.876 --> 00:15:40.586
Why would she do something like this?

00:15:40.669 --> 00:15:42.796
Does it make sense to you, Mr. Baek?

00:16:03.859 --> 00:16:05.861
She took my phone,

00:16:07.029 --> 00:16:09.406
knowing it had a photo of her.

00:17:04.545 --> 00:17:05.379
NEW EMAIL

00:17:06.463 --> 00:17:08.298
AN YUN-SU'S DIGITAL CAMERA
HAS BEEN RESTORED

00:17:26.733 --> 00:17:29.987
The immediate cause of death
was the four stab wounds to the neck,

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:31.864
piercing the carotid artery.

00:17:31.947 --> 00:17:34.283
There's a clear strangulation mark.

00:17:55.929 --> 00:17:59.057
These are all clues
that point to her killing Ko Se-hun.

00:17:59.141 --> 00:18:01.476
Did someone paint that
pretending to be her too?

00:18:15.657 --> 00:18:17.451
Why were you at the scene of his death?

00:18:17.534 --> 00:18:20.162
Did you really make some kind of deal
with the Witch?

00:18:32.174 --> 00:18:33.258
Go see Mo Eun.

00:18:34.968 --> 00:18:36.511
Let's find out why An Yun-su

00:18:37.179 --> 00:18:38.513
is being like this

00:18:38.597 --> 00:18:39.681
and what she knows.

00:18:40.349 --> 00:18:42.226
Then I'll ask the questions.

00:18:42.768 --> 00:18:43.852
In my own way.

00:18:44.561 --> 00:18:45.646
I look forward to it.

00:18:59.785 --> 00:19:01.370
DELETE

00:19:07.084 --> 00:19:08.585
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

00:19:11.588 --> 00:19:14.132
Mr. Jang and Prosecutor Baek are here.

00:19:14.216 --> 00:19:16.343
They say they want to talk to you.

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:26.687
Wait, I heard coffee was allowed.

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:27.646
These aren't.

00:19:28.647 --> 00:19:29.481
I see.

00:19:29.982 --> 00:19:32.359
-She still needs to rest.
-I know.

00:19:34.027 --> 00:19:36.822
Please refrain
from using provocative language.

00:19:36.905 --> 00:19:37.948
Can we go in?

00:19:46.873 --> 00:19:48.834
The conversation will be recorded.

00:19:49.459 --> 00:19:50.711
Do I have your consent?

00:19:52.713 --> 00:19:53.672
Verbally, please.

00:19:54.589 --> 00:19:55.424
Yes.

00:19:58.802 --> 00:20:00.971
Please uncuff her.

00:20:10.314 --> 00:20:11.857
I'll be outside.

00:20:18.613 --> 00:20:19.698
I'm Jang Jeong-gu,

00:20:20.198 --> 00:20:21.658
Ms. An's attorney.

00:20:23.827 --> 00:20:24.661
I know.

00:20:25.162 --> 00:20:26.580
I've seen you often.

00:20:36.631 --> 00:20:39.801
Even if you're busy with the recital,
don't forget your hand cream.

00:20:40.635 --> 00:20:43.221
It's getting cold.
You should take care of them.

00:20:46.433 --> 00:20:50.020
Prosecutor Baek and Mr. Jang
are questioning Inmate 407.

00:20:50.103 --> 00:20:52.481
I suggested it be done in your presence,

00:20:52.564 --> 00:20:54.274
but she refused.

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.526
How is Ms. Mo doing?

00:20:59.279 --> 00:21:00.614
Her surgery went well.

00:21:01.531 --> 00:21:02.366
But it seems

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:07.537
the prosecutor and Ms. An's attorney
have gone to visit her right now.

00:21:08.038 --> 00:21:09.873
Shouldn't you be there, then?

00:21:11.416 --> 00:21:13.168
She apparently doesn't want me there.

00:21:17.631 --> 00:21:19.549
I'll go see Mr. Jang later.

00:21:35.065 --> 00:21:38.610
Right now, Ms. An doesn't seem like
the person I know.

00:21:38.693 --> 00:21:40.028
Something's not right.

00:21:40.946 --> 00:21:43.907
The investigation team thinks
she's provoking them.

00:21:44.533 --> 00:21:46.159
If something goes wrong--

00:21:46.243 --> 00:21:49.413
What else could possibly go wrong?

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:55.043
We have to find her.

00:21:55.836 --> 00:21:57.712
I want to know where she is.

00:22:00.382 --> 00:22:02.050
I don't know either.

00:22:08.557 --> 00:22:10.058
Why did you do that to her?

00:22:11.101 --> 00:22:13.019
Why her of all people?

00:22:14.938 --> 00:22:16.565
She's easy,

00:22:16.648 --> 00:22:17.691
that woman.

00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:24.239
That's why

00:22:25.824 --> 00:22:28.034
you also thought it was her.

00:22:30.745 --> 00:22:32.122
She's too

00:22:33.415 --> 00:22:34.666
transparent.

00:22:36.126 --> 00:22:38.462
And people take advantage of that.

00:22:41.506 --> 00:22:43.341
Is that why you took advantage too?

00:22:43.925 --> 00:22:45.302
In exchange for a confession--

00:22:45.385 --> 00:22:47.345
I made a deal with her to kill Ko Se-hun?

00:22:49.681 --> 00:22:50.515
Didn't you?

00:22:58.440 --> 00:22:59.983
They trace back to the detention center.

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:03.904
Ms. An was always anxious.

00:23:03.987 --> 00:23:05.489
Probably because of you.

00:23:06.531 --> 00:23:08.366
You don't have much time.

00:23:08.867 --> 00:23:11.036
Don't get any funny ideas.

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:14.289
What kind of situation
did you corner her into?

00:23:14.372 --> 00:23:16.333
THIS IS WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING?
YOU DON'T HAVE TIME

00:23:17.876 --> 00:23:19.503
Why did you back her into a corner

00:23:19.586 --> 00:23:23.131
when she's barely holding on,
just to make her to come find you?

00:23:25.342 --> 00:23:28.553
She said you knew
she didn't kill Ko Se-hun.

00:23:29.137 --> 00:23:30.138
How did you know?

00:23:30.722 --> 00:23:32.140
What is it you know?

00:23:33.558 --> 00:23:36.394
You know the photo she took is different.

00:23:36.478 --> 00:23:38.230
Don't you, Mr. Baek?

00:23:42.108 --> 00:23:44.236
What is she talking about?

00:23:47.364 --> 00:23:48.532
You're right.

00:23:49.115 --> 00:23:50.075
It's different.

00:23:51.451 --> 00:23:55.163
The photo that matches the autopsy results
should be the one you swallowed,

00:23:55.247 --> 00:23:57.165
not the one recovered from An's camera.

00:23:57.249 --> 00:23:58.792
-It's that painting.
-Mr. Baek.

00:23:58.875 --> 00:24:01.378
Fine. Let's say
what you're saying is true.

00:24:02.587 --> 00:24:06.383
But what if it was An Yun-su
who sent the photo you ate?

00:24:07.384 --> 00:24:10.303
What if she's fooling you and using us?

00:24:12.055 --> 00:24:14.099
She's "easy" and "transparent."

00:24:14.182 --> 00:24:15.684
So it's not her?

00:24:17.394 --> 00:24:20.021
How can you say that
when there's clear evidence?

00:24:25.443 --> 00:24:27.028
How could you possibly know her?

00:24:28.113 --> 00:24:31.199
All you did was talk to her
through a wall for a few days.

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.829
You could just be biased.

00:24:39.249 --> 00:24:40.292
You're right.

00:24:40.959 --> 00:24:41.793
I'm biased.

00:24:43.962 --> 00:24:46.423
I've been biased
since the moment I saw her.

00:24:47.757 --> 00:24:49.342
The same goes for you,

00:24:50.093 --> 00:24:51.428
Mr. Baek.

00:25:08.361 --> 00:25:10.488
An Yun-su showed up
at Hongseo Art Gallery.

00:25:10.572 --> 00:25:12.324
It's Lee Ki-dae's memorial exhibition.

00:25:12.824 --> 00:25:15.327
I think she went to see
her husband's work.

00:25:16.286 --> 00:25:19.414
I don't know what she's thinking
at a time like this.

00:25:32.218 --> 00:25:35.347
Is there anything else you're hiding
besides the inconsistent photo?

00:25:38.016 --> 00:25:39.476
Did I believe she was innocent?

00:25:43.146 --> 00:25:45.982
I just hoped she was
because I couldn't be sure.

00:25:51.488 --> 00:25:53.281
And you? Are you still certain?

00:25:55.075 --> 00:25:56.326
You're not, are you?

00:25:58.286 --> 00:26:01.539
"Maybe An Yun-su was never the killer,
like she said."

00:26:01.623 --> 00:26:03.541
"If I hadn't sent her to prison,

00:26:03.625 --> 00:26:05.919
maybe none of this would've happened."

00:26:06.002 --> 00:26:08.296
Isn't that what you're starting to think?

00:26:10.048 --> 00:26:11.299
You're doubtful, right?

00:26:13.218 --> 00:26:14.219
Mr. Baek!

00:26:15.136 --> 00:26:17.097
Why can't you be doubtful?

00:26:18.098 --> 00:26:19.849
Be doubtful all you want!

00:26:32.946 --> 00:26:35.240
I've watched all the episodes of CSI.

00:26:35.323 --> 00:26:37.492
They always start with family members too.

00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:40.787
As for me, I'm into bold clothes.

00:26:47.043 --> 00:26:48.712
I have to go home.

00:26:49.337 --> 00:26:51.506
By the way, thank you for everything.

00:26:52.006 --> 00:26:53.133
Thank you.

00:26:55.385 --> 00:26:56.845
What makes you so certain

00:26:57.345 --> 00:26:58.638
that I did it?

00:26:58.722 --> 00:26:59.931
What would you know?

00:27:01.057 --> 00:27:02.434
I just believe it.

00:27:03.435 --> 00:27:04.602
An Yun-su

00:27:05.478 --> 00:27:06.980
did not kill Ko Se-hun.

00:27:08.148 --> 00:27:10.775
That's who she really is.

00:27:21.119 --> 00:27:24.289

BREAKING NEWS: CONFESSION VIDEO
OF AN YUN-SU GOES VIRAL

00:30:11.623 --> 00:30:13.499
I killed my husband.

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:16.044
And at the detention center,

00:30:16.544 --> 00:30:19.255
I made a deal with Mo Eun
that I never should have.

00:30:20.423 --> 00:30:22.592
She would confess to killing my husband,

00:30:23.593 --> 00:30:26.554
and in return,
I would kill Ko Se-hun once I got out.

00:30:29.265 --> 00:30:31.684
I accepted this terrible deal…

00:30:33.686 --> 00:30:35.688
out of my own hideous selfishness.

00:30:37.023 --> 00:30:39.400
I wanted to live with my daughter again.

00:30:43.279 --> 00:30:44.572
After I got out,

00:30:45.657 --> 00:30:47.992
I tracked Ko Se-hun's movements.

00:30:49.035 --> 00:30:52.538
When I finally came face-to-face with him…

00:30:54.666 --> 00:30:56.417
I couldn't kill him.

00:30:58.127 --> 00:31:00.046
I couldn't take another life

00:31:00.755 --> 00:31:03.007
just so I could go on living.

00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:07.261
I'm publicly revealing my crime like this

00:31:07.887 --> 00:31:10.974
because the investigation team
turned a blind eye to evidence

00:31:11.057 --> 00:31:14.560
that a third party was present
on the day Ko Se-hun died,

00:31:14.644 --> 00:31:17.355
turning me into a murderer once again.

00:31:17.981 --> 00:31:20.900
The investigation team has
the dashcam footage of another person

00:31:22.026 --> 00:31:23.569
leaving Ko Se-hun's house.

00:31:25.029 --> 00:31:26.239
Why would she do this now?

00:31:26.322 --> 00:31:28.116
OCTOBER 7, LIGHTS TURNED ON AT 8 P.M.

00:31:30.576 --> 00:31:32.078
I killed my husband.

00:31:32.578 --> 00:31:35.081
But I did not kill Ko Se-hun.

00:31:36.124 --> 00:31:38.584
I will accept the punishment for my crime.

00:31:40.545 --> 00:31:42.463
And the real killer of Ko Se-hun

00:31:43.131 --> 00:31:44.632
must also be punished.

00:32:42.023 --> 00:32:44.442
But I did not kill Ko Se-hun.

00:32:44.942 --> 00:32:47.361
I will accept the punishment for my crime.

00:32:48.029 --> 00:32:49.947
And the real killer of Ko Se-hun

00:32:50.656 --> 00:32:52.200
must also be punished.

00:32:53.284 --> 00:32:54.285
Ms. An.

00:32:56.037 --> 00:32:59.499
Is this what you've wanted to say?

00:33:02.543 --> 00:33:03.586
Hello, Detective Unit.

00:33:09.133 --> 00:33:11.511
-Yes, Gyeonggi Bukbu Provincial Police.
-Hurry!

00:33:15.056 --> 00:33:16.224

But that day,

00:33:43.709 --> 00:33:46.337
you did your best to save that girl.

00:33:56.139 --> 00:33:57.598
GU ***-YEONG / F

00:33:58.307 --> 00:33:59.183
Come in.

00:34:07.316 --> 00:34:09.360
She wants to thank you
for saving her life.

00:34:16.325 --> 00:34:18.035
I'll be watching from behind.

00:34:36.053 --> 00:34:37.513
Thank you…

00:34:39.724 --> 00:34:40.850
for saving my life.

00:34:42.727 --> 00:34:43.561
We've…

00:34:45.646 --> 00:34:46.814
met before, haven't we?

00:34:49.317 --> 00:34:50.401
Over a video call.

00:34:51.319 --> 00:34:52.236
That's right.

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:53.905
I remember.

00:34:55.281 --> 00:34:56.782
She talked about you

00:34:57.742 --> 00:34:58.951
a lot.

00:35:00.244 --> 00:35:01.287
Were you two close?

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:04.957
Not at first.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.294
I was the type to skip school a lot.

00:35:09.879 --> 00:35:10.713
But

00:35:11.714 --> 00:35:13.007
we ended up sharing a desk,

00:35:13.507 --> 00:35:15.718
and So-mang spoke to me first.

00:35:16.344 --> 00:35:17.970
That's how we got close.

00:35:19.764 --> 00:35:21.807
She was a chatterbox.

00:35:27.855 --> 00:35:29.774
She really loved to talk.

00:35:31.984 --> 00:35:34.487
But I didn't listen when it mattered most.

00:35:51.295 --> 00:35:52.296
He's here.

00:35:54.298 --> 00:35:56.175
Can the past case be reopened?

00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:02.723
Later!

00:36:10.731 --> 00:36:11.607
There you are.

00:36:12.191 --> 00:36:13.317
Hello, Mr. Baek.

00:36:13.401 --> 00:36:15.987
So did you really cover it up?

00:36:16.487 --> 00:36:17.321
Did you?

00:36:18.781 --> 00:36:19.949
No such thing happened.

00:36:20.449 --> 00:36:21.492
Nothing like that.

00:36:23.661 --> 00:36:24.829
Hello, sir.

00:36:25.538 --> 00:36:27.790
There's no such evidence. It's a lie.

00:36:27.873 --> 00:36:28.708
I know.

00:36:31.919 --> 00:36:36.340
Let's find An Yun-su first. Then you can
ask her why and what her intentions were.

00:36:37.717 --> 00:36:39.635
Whether it was a desperate move,

00:36:40.219 --> 00:36:41.053
or…

00:36:41.554 --> 00:36:42.680
Hello.

00:36:43.764 --> 00:36:44.765
Who let him in?

00:36:44.849 --> 00:36:46.726
I'm here as Ms. An's attorney.

00:36:46.809 --> 00:36:47.643
As what?

00:36:48.769 --> 00:36:51.063
I said I'm here as Ms. An's attorney.

00:36:52.648 --> 00:36:55.776
Just as I found her alibi
proving she didn't kill Ko Se-hun,

00:36:57.028 --> 00:36:58.988
she confessed to killing her husband.

00:37:00.239 --> 00:37:01.324
Does that make sense?

00:37:05.077 --> 00:37:05.953
Look, Mr. Jang.

00:37:06.704 --> 00:37:08.205
Do you still trust her?

00:37:09.123 --> 00:37:12.001
A woman who killed her husband
and made a deal with a murderer?

00:37:12.626 --> 00:37:14.003
Tell me what you think.

00:37:15.421 --> 00:37:18.174
Are you still sure
An Yun-su is the killer?

00:37:20.468 --> 00:37:21.302
Are you?

00:37:22.303 --> 00:37:24.180
Was An Yun-su telling the truth

00:37:24.764 --> 00:37:25.848
about the evidence?

00:37:25.931 --> 00:37:28.309
Why on earth are you hiding it?

00:37:30.186 --> 00:37:31.354
Mr. Jin,

00:37:31.854 --> 00:37:33.731
who do you think is lying?

00:37:35.733 --> 00:37:39.111
She even confessed to her husband's murder
just to say it.

00:37:39.653 --> 00:37:43.032
Because no one would listen
when she only cried out she was wronged.

00:37:47.286 --> 00:37:48.704
You know something, don't you?

00:37:50.831 --> 00:37:51.707
What is it?

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.377
Mr. Baek.

00:37:56.504 --> 00:37:57.338
Excuse me.

00:37:58.923 --> 00:38:01.425
Mr. Jang, Sop has gone missing.

00:38:01.509 --> 00:38:02.635
What?

00:38:04.178 --> 00:38:06.263
She seems to have been kidnapped.

00:38:06.347 --> 00:38:07.973
A kid said

00:38:08.474 --> 00:38:10.935
they saw an old man take her.

00:38:11.018 --> 00:38:12.019
What do we do?

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:13.354
Huh?

00:38:35.292 --> 00:38:37.837
Ko Se-hun used to gamble in online games.

00:38:38.421 --> 00:38:39.755
He lost his hagwon fees

00:38:39.839 --> 00:38:42.133
and even borrowed money from his friends.

00:38:42.216 --> 00:38:46.679
Then he started selling deepfake images
of the girls from school.

00:38:49.557 --> 00:38:51.100
Eventually, he started

00:38:52.435 --> 00:38:53.519
to record videos.

00:38:56.605 --> 00:38:57.815
There was this kid

00:38:59.024 --> 00:39:00.234
who helped him.

00:39:00.943 --> 00:39:02.528
Is it the one who visited you?

00:39:08.159 --> 00:39:09.827
He's Ko Se-hun's cat lackey.

00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:12.371
Se-hun even made him install
the pet cam on his phone.

00:39:12.455 --> 00:39:15.916
He was paid by Se-hun
to edit photos of girls

00:39:16.876 --> 00:39:19.670
until Se-hun used it as leverage
to make him his lackey.

00:39:22.631 --> 00:39:23.924
But he said…

00:39:26.135 --> 00:39:27.136
he saw

00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:29.597
Ko Se-hun getting killed.

00:39:31.599 --> 00:39:32.892
Listen to me carefully.

00:39:34.059 --> 00:39:35.352
I saw Ko Se-hun…

00:39:37.813 --> 00:39:38.939
get killed.

00:39:43.819 --> 00:39:45.279
Who did he say it was?

00:40:01.795 --> 00:40:05.508
KANG SO-MANG, SEXUAL ASSAULT CASE
KO SE-HUN, PROTECTIVE DETENTION NO. 5

00:44:48.207 --> 00:44:53.212
