Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org

00:00:07.112 --> 00:00:08.546
Please accept this.

00:00:08.613 --> 00:00:09.547
I don't need this.

00:00:09.614 --> 00:00:12.917
Please don't come and see me again.

00:00:12.984 --> 00:00:17.755
Kozo Sanno announced he would retire
along with his horse, Royal Hope.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.594
This was a difficult decision he made
after being struck by illness.

00:00:23.161 --> 00:00:24.028
ARIMA KINEN

00:00:24.095 --> 00:00:27.465
On a rainy-day Arima Kinen,
Royal Hope's final powerful run…

00:00:27.532 --> 00:00:28.833
-Go!
-Hope!

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.138
…failed to mark
the beginning of a new era.

00:00:33.204 --> 00:00:35.807
A THREE-WAY BATTLE BETWEEN IMAGINE DRAGON,
VALSHARE, AND ROYAL HOPE!

00:00:35.874 --> 00:00:37.408
AFTER A FIERCE FIGHT, IMAGINE DRAGON WINS!

00:00:42.847 --> 00:00:45.150
-Welcome!
-One coffee, please.

00:00:45.216 --> 00:00:46.284
Coming right up.

00:00:50.388 --> 00:00:51.689
ROYAL HOPE BLOODLINE

00:00:51.756 --> 00:00:52.724
MOROCCO DESIGN'S PROGENY

00:00:53.525 --> 00:00:54.659
Is it Nakayama?

00:00:56.294 --> 00:00:57.529
Am I early?

00:00:57.595 --> 00:01:00.265
-Not at all.
-Oh, keep going.

00:01:00.331 --> 00:01:02.133
Nakayama Kimpai's predictions, right?

00:01:02.634 --> 00:01:06.404
It will be an interesting race.
They are all skilled horses.

00:01:07.605 --> 00:01:10.008
By the way, what are your predictions?

00:01:10.074 --> 00:01:13.211
Please stop addressing me so politely.

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:15.813
Understood.

00:01:24.756 --> 00:01:29.928
I think the Number Three and
Number Nine horses are good candidates.

00:01:30.695 --> 00:01:32.363
Three and Nine, huh?

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.865
Will you buy a betting ticket?

00:01:33.932 --> 00:01:37.335
Oh, I only bet on our horses.

00:01:37.902 --> 00:01:39.938
I don't know much about horses, so…

00:01:40.004 --> 00:01:41.506
Thank you for waiting.

00:01:46.377 --> 00:01:47.879
I'm sorry I couldn't go.

00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:50.548
-There's no need…
-That morning at Nakayama.

00:01:54.252 --> 00:01:56.588
I'm sorry for asking too much of you.

00:01:57.322 --> 00:02:00.058
I first wanted to apologize for that.

00:02:00.124 --> 00:02:01.092
It's nothing.

00:02:03.962 --> 00:02:05.096
And also…

00:02:07.165 --> 00:02:09.634
Is he doing all right?

00:02:10.768 --> 00:02:12.303
The President?

00:02:12.937 --> 00:02:15.139
Yes, thankfully.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.375
Even his doctor is surprised.

00:02:17.942 --> 00:02:19.444
Is he going to keep being a horse owner?

00:02:23.014 --> 00:02:24.182
As much as possible.

00:02:27.218 --> 00:02:30.021
Are you not struggling?

00:02:31.623 --> 00:02:36.261
Royal doesn't have any
promising horses other than Hope.

00:02:36.327 --> 00:02:40.999
Hope has the role of carrying on
the bloodline as a stud.

00:02:42.767 --> 00:02:45.136
To win the Arima with a horse from Hidaka.

00:02:45.637 --> 00:02:48.906
Our goal will be passed on
to the next generation.

00:02:48.973 --> 00:02:51.075
And the candidate for the broodmare?

00:02:51.142 --> 00:02:52.577
We're working on that.

00:02:52.644 --> 00:02:56.481
We have a broodmare
the President acquired, so…

00:02:58.616 --> 00:02:59.851
Is there something wrong?

00:03:04.656 --> 00:03:07.925
Can I meet with the President once?

00:03:08.526 --> 00:03:09.994
-What?
-Please.

00:03:13.898 --> 00:03:16.200
Hope, good morning.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.240
Oh, you're not drinking much water.

00:03:25.443 --> 00:03:28.846
Today, we will do some light exercise,
mainly walking,

00:03:28.913 --> 00:03:30.882
to loosen up the body.

00:03:30.948 --> 00:03:33.251
Hope, look. It's the President! Hello!

00:03:33.318 --> 00:03:35.019
Hope, how are you?

00:03:35.086 --> 00:03:36.954
Oh, it's old man Kurisu.

00:03:37.021 --> 00:03:40.091
I'm not that old, you know.

00:03:40.725 --> 00:03:44.762
He will be moving to a new stable
next month as a stud.

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:49.000
We are letting him release
the stress of racing for a while.

00:03:49.067 --> 00:03:50.335
I'll leave it up to you.

00:03:50.401 --> 00:03:52.537
As for the broodmare candidates,

00:03:52.603 --> 00:03:56.274
can we go ahead as planned
with Warsaw, born in 2016?

00:03:56.341 --> 00:03:59.477
Yes, she should have a strong child.

00:04:01.846 --> 00:04:03.381
Understood.

00:04:06.718 --> 00:04:08.820
-Kurisu.
-Yes?

00:04:09.654 --> 00:04:12.523
Why did he change his mind?

00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:14.325
He just said…

00:04:14.392 --> 00:04:18.029
There's something I want
to tell him as soon as possible.

00:04:18.096 --> 00:04:19.230
That's all.

00:04:20.198 --> 00:04:21.632
Bloodlines.

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:24.302
In the world of horse racing,
the value of a racehorse

00:04:24.369 --> 00:04:26.904
is heavily influenced by its bloodline.

00:04:26.971 --> 00:04:30.007
Breeders not only consider
the performance of the sire and dam,

00:04:30.074 --> 00:04:33.644
but also examine the track record
of close relatives and pedigrees

00:04:33.711 --> 00:04:35.980
spanning several generations
to explore new breeding options.

00:04:36.047 --> 00:04:40.985
Horse owners have the important mission
of protecting their bloodlines.

00:04:41.052 --> 00:04:44.522
ROYAL FAMILY

00:04:46.357 --> 00:04:47.725
What a great sound.

00:04:47.792 --> 00:04:50.595
Eating what you like
is the best after all.

00:04:50.661 --> 00:04:51.729
I think so, too.

00:04:54.132 --> 00:04:55.366
Welcome.

00:04:55.433 --> 00:04:56.501
Welcome.

00:04:58.169 --> 00:04:59.504
-I've brought him.
-Okay.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.941
Hey.

00:05:06.744 --> 00:05:07.945
Let's go over there.

00:05:09.781 --> 00:05:10.948
-Let me.
-Thank you.

00:05:16.721 --> 00:05:17.688
Here's your daikon.

00:05:26.097 --> 00:05:27.298
I see.

00:05:28.032 --> 00:05:30.334
You're not good at handling your alcohol.

00:05:30.835 --> 00:05:32.103
It's not that.

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.606
But, I don't go to many drinking parties.

00:05:36.174 --> 00:05:38.209
Then I bet university isn't fun.

00:05:38.276 --> 00:05:40.044
That's not true.

00:05:40.545 --> 00:05:42.280
He's going there to study.

00:05:43.214 --> 00:05:47.118
And even if he doesn't go drinking,
he has many friends.

00:05:47.185 --> 00:05:51.522
There are only one or two people
I can call my friends.

00:05:52.523 --> 00:05:54.025
A select few.

00:05:55.326 --> 00:05:57.562
Do you like horses?

00:05:58.896 --> 00:05:59.997
So-so.

00:06:02.366 --> 00:06:04.435
-Me too. So-so.
-That can't be true.

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:06.938
You can't be a horse owner
unless you do, right?

00:06:10.842 --> 00:06:14.445
You can't continue being a horse owner
just because you love them.

00:06:15.246 --> 00:06:17.348
-So it's only business to you?
-Here's your soft roe.

00:06:19.417 --> 00:06:22.653
I can't put it simply in one word.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.590
Horses cannot be raised by calculation.

00:06:25.656 --> 00:06:29.126
If you only have ideals,
people will leave.

00:06:31.095 --> 00:06:34.732
This is a learning experience,
as it's a world I have no connection to.

00:06:37.635 --> 00:06:40.004
-Could we get another, please?
-Yes!

00:06:40.571 --> 00:06:41.906
I'm sorry.

00:06:45.743 --> 00:06:47.411
I didn't know anything.

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:49.847
I'm really sorry.

00:06:50.381 --> 00:06:51.883
That's enough.

00:06:53.217 --> 00:06:55.386
-Let me support you.
-I don't need it.

00:06:55.453 --> 00:06:56.687
I will not be satisfied.

00:07:04.996 --> 00:07:06.297
Do you think I'm unhappy?

00:07:07.965 --> 00:07:09.767
Is that why you're so sorry?

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:13.738
Then why are you not satisfied?

00:07:13.804 --> 00:07:16.908
Forcing things on me that I don't want,
how will that make you satisfied?

00:07:18.809 --> 00:07:21.846
Both of you,
please eat before it gets cold.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.282
You say that,

00:07:26.484 --> 00:07:28.786
but humans are all about
self-satisfaction.

00:07:29.353 --> 00:07:30.655
President, you too…

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:34.125
Thank you for waiting.

00:07:34.725 --> 00:07:35.893
Excuse me.

00:07:40.431 --> 00:07:42.700
Why didn't you retire with Hope?

00:07:44.135 --> 00:07:45.836
Is it because you couldn't give up?

00:07:45.903 --> 00:07:49.006
Was it because you were so close
to winning the Arima?

00:07:49.674 --> 00:07:52.209
Aren't you just toying with everyone
for your own satisfaction?

00:07:52.276 --> 00:07:54.879
-Koichi!
-What about breeding Hope?

00:07:56.581 --> 00:07:58.115
You know how many years it takes

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:02.153
for a newborn horse
to become a racehorse, right?

00:08:02.219 --> 00:08:06.991
During that time, will you be able
to responsibly support those foals?

00:08:08.326 --> 00:08:10.628
Can you be there for them…

00:08:14.832 --> 00:08:16.968
when they really need you?

00:08:23.741 --> 00:08:27.378
I will take responsibility
for their future, so--

00:08:27.445 --> 00:08:29.880
Then don't tell me
you know nothing about horses.

00:08:29.947 --> 00:08:33.417
Don't pretend you know about horses
and take them seriously.

00:08:33.484 --> 00:08:35.019
Enough already.

00:08:36.821 --> 00:08:38.089
He has nothing to do with it.

00:08:41.025 --> 00:08:42.760
President, are you okay?

00:08:44.228 --> 00:08:45.997
Do you want to take your medicine?

00:08:48.099 --> 00:08:50.935
That's the worst.

00:08:51.002 --> 00:08:52.570
Yes, it was.

00:08:52.637 --> 00:08:56.907
He speaks calmly
and at first glance seems like an adult.

00:08:57.875 --> 00:09:01.646
But he gets mad quickly and is stubborn.

00:09:02.146 --> 00:09:04.649
And the President?
As usual, he refuses to give in.

00:09:04.715 --> 00:09:08.452
I'm sorry, but they are exactly alike.

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.155
You should have said that to them.

00:09:11.222 --> 00:09:12.323
I can't do that.

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:13.891
What is that?

00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.027
"What is that?"

00:09:18.229 --> 00:09:19.463
But…

00:09:20.331 --> 00:09:23.267
I know now that he's opposed to him
continuing to be a horse owner.

00:09:24.769 --> 00:09:27.104
What? He's opposed?

00:09:27.838 --> 00:09:29.106
-What?
-Well…

00:09:29.173 --> 00:09:31.809
Koichi knows a lot
about horse racing, right?

00:09:31.876 --> 00:09:34.211
Didn't he win
at the Nakayama Kimpai this year?

00:09:34.278 --> 00:09:36.681
Oh, right. Yes, he did.

00:09:37.348 --> 00:09:40.217
I can't believe he'd get Number Three
and Number Nine right.

00:09:41.519 --> 00:09:43.087
That kind of person…

00:09:43.754 --> 00:09:45.790
He knows that if the President gives up,

00:09:45.856 --> 00:09:48.626
Hope's bloodline
will come to an end, right?

00:09:48.693 --> 00:09:49.694
Yes.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:53.864
Maybe it's not that he's opposed to it,
but he's worried about it.

00:09:54.465 --> 00:09:55.900
About the President and the horse.

00:09:56.467 --> 00:09:57.601
Worried?

00:09:58.369 --> 00:10:00.171
Maybe he just can't
express himself properly.

00:10:00.237 --> 00:10:04.175
Wasn't he saying, "Think about the horses
that will be left behind."

00:10:05.609 --> 00:10:07.311
I see.

00:10:08.112 --> 00:10:09.146
Yes.

00:10:10.047 --> 00:10:14.485
But is that even possible?

00:10:15.553 --> 00:10:17.888
-Horse inheritance?
-Yes.

00:10:17.955 --> 00:10:21.859
I was wondering if Koichi
could inherit your horses.

00:10:22.593 --> 00:10:25.429
He's enthusiastic about horses.

00:10:25.496 --> 00:10:27.231
That would be impossible.

00:10:27.932 --> 00:10:31.235
To own a racehorse,
you need a horse owner's license.

00:10:31.736 --> 00:10:34.572
If that's the case,
then there's no problem.

00:10:34.638 --> 00:10:36.273
I think we can do that.

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:40.544
There's a license which grants
ownership to inherited horses only.

00:10:40.611 --> 00:10:42.747
-Inheritance-only Horse Ownership?
-Yes.

00:10:42.813 --> 00:10:48.452
All of the horses he owns
will be inherited by his legal heir.

00:10:49.386 --> 00:10:51.322
In this particular case…

00:10:51.388 --> 00:10:54.592
The original ownership
requirements don't apply.

00:10:56.093 --> 00:10:59.764
Even if your income up to the previous
year was less than 17 million yen,

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:02.967
and your total assets
don't reach 75 million yen,

00:11:03.601 --> 00:11:07.671
if you can afford the cost of feed,
you can become a horse owner.

00:11:08.205 --> 00:11:08.906
Even Koichi?

00:11:09.673 --> 00:11:11.709
He can be a horse owner.

00:11:11.776 --> 00:11:14.111
However, only racehorses

00:11:14.678 --> 00:11:18.682
that were registered by the owner
during his lifetime can be inherited.

00:11:21.485 --> 00:11:24.688
If you like these terms,

00:11:25.356 --> 00:11:29.760
I will assist fully with the inheritance.

00:11:32.963 --> 00:11:34.165
Inheritance…

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:44.208
President.

00:11:53.684 --> 00:11:54.785
You…

00:11:56.086 --> 00:11:57.855
You may not be unhappy,

00:11:58.722 --> 00:12:02.359
but I want you to be happy.

00:12:02.426 --> 00:12:03.661
That's how I feel.

00:12:04.495 --> 00:12:07.364
Even if you are at your happiest,

00:12:08.032 --> 00:12:09.700
I'd still want more for you.

00:12:11.569 --> 00:12:13.537
That's what parents are.

00:12:26.083 --> 00:12:28.752
I won't apologize anymore.

00:12:30.788 --> 00:12:32.189
I won't assist you, either.

00:12:35.326 --> 00:12:36.293
Just…

00:12:38.162 --> 00:12:40.297
Could you take over my horses?

00:12:47.538 --> 00:12:48.772
Don't worry.

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:51.508
Kurisu will help you.

00:12:52.443 --> 00:12:54.612
If you have any concerns, ask him.

00:12:57.047 --> 00:12:59.783
Never once in my life have I imagined

00:13:01.085 --> 00:13:02.920
that I would become a horse owner.

00:13:03.821 --> 00:13:05.356
Me too.

00:13:10.828 --> 00:13:14.231
Thank you very much
for thinking so much about this.

00:13:16.934 --> 00:13:18.269
But, still…

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:20.571
I must refuse.

00:13:23.307 --> 00:13:26.477
I don't think I could be a horse owner.

00:13:27.044 --> 00:13:28.412
-Besides…
-Besides?

00:13:29.747 --> 00:13:30.781
Besides,

00:13:32.182 --> 00:13:34.685
it's also because there are no horses
currently owned by Royal

00:13:35.619 --> 00:13:38.322
that I would like to inherit.

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:48.299
Is that so? I see.

00:13:48.365 --> 00:13:49.967
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be.

00:13:50.801 --> 00:13:52.336
You are talented.

00:13:53.804 --> 00:13:55.472
I see.

00:13:56.874 --> 00:13:59.043
If there's none, then it can't be helped.

00:14:01.545 --> 00:14:04.348
President. I heard that you came.

00:14:04.415 --> 00:14:06.550
-Please stop by.
-Okay.

00:14:14.458 --> 00:14:16.460
President, your complexion is good.

00:14:18.195 --> 00:14:20.197
The air here is good.

00:14:21.932 --> 00:14:23.634
The hospital doesn't smell like horses.

00:14:23.701 --> 00:14:25.569
He needs a veterinary hospital.

00:14:25.636 --> 00:14:27.304
Oh, shut up.

00:14:29.373 --> 00:14:31.809
Good morning, Mr. Kurisu.

00:14:31.875 --> 00:14:33.844
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

00:14:35.946 --> 00:14:38.649
Why did you want to meet
with the President?

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.154
You don't need anything.

00:14:45.122 --> 00:14:47.224
You don't need his apology and assistance.

00:14:49.093 --> 00:14:51.662
You wanted to tell
the President something, right?

00:14:52.396 --> 00:14:53.597
Please tell me.

00:14:55.032 --> 00:14:56.800
What are you thinking?

00:15:05.175 --> 00:15:08.479
At first, I thought
I should definitely tell him,

00:15:09.046 --> 00:15:11.148
but then I thought
it was none of my business.

00:15:11.215 --> 00:15:12.182
What is it?

00:15:14.251 --> 00:15:15.119
Well…

00:15:17.988 --> 00:15:20.591
I think I should say it, so I'll say it.

00:15:21.191 --> 00:15:22.059
To me?

00:15:22.126 --> 00:15:25.529
I'm only worried about Hope's foal.

00:15:26.296 --> 00:15:29.366
I wonder if you're really
thinking about Hope's foal.

00:15:29.433 --> 00:15:31.668
-I'm super worried--
-Wait! Let's go somewhere else.

00:15:31.735 --> 00:15:35.372
Let's go somewhere else. Okay.

00:15:35.439 --> 00:15:36.740
Hope's foal?

00:15:36.807 --> 00:15:37.841
Yes.

00:15:37.908 --> 00:15:40.110
I did a bit of research on Royal's horses.

00:15:40.177 --> 00:15:44.615
The broodmare isn't Warsaw,
the one you bought last year, right?

00:15:44.681 --> 00:15:45.516
-It is.
-No!

00:15:45.582 --> 00:15:46.850
-You can't!
-What?

00:15:46.917 --> 00:15:48.719
-No, you can't do that!
-Why?

00:15:48.786 --> 00:15:49.953
It won't run.

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:51.055
How can you--

00:15:51.121 --> 00:15:53.090
Did you look into bloodlines?

00:15:53.157 --> 00:15:55.125
Bloodlines, well, yes…

00:15:55.192 --> 00:15:57.428
This isn't something so trivial.

00:15:57.494 --> 00:16:01.899
-What?
-I did research. Do you have time?

00:16:01.965 --> 00:16:04.401
Excuse me! Sorry for interrupting, but…

00:16:04.468 --> 00:16:08.505
Come in, if you like.
We can hear you really well.

00:16:10.774 --> 00:16:14.044
Sorry, my saying,
"It won't run," was a mistake.

00:16:15.112 --> 00:16:17.114
If you trace the bloodline back,

00:16:17.181 --> 00:16:20.751
there is a high possibility that a horse
with an extreme temper will be born.

00:16:20.818 --> 00:16:26.123
Also, if you trace the sire's bloodline,
you will find this horse, Morocco Design.

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:29.460
Apparently,
he's not working out as a stud.

00:16:30.494 --> 00:16:35.032
Hope was a miraculous success
by his sire, Phase Unbeatable, but…

00:16:35.099 --> 00:16:38.235
I summarized it in a table,
so please take a look.

00:16:39.303 --> 00:16:41.872
There is not a single horse
in the award-winning class.

00:16:42.539 --> 00:16:45.542
In the first place, Hope is a horse
with stamina and fighting spirit,

00:16:45.609 --> 00:16:47.578
but he's not particularly fast, right?

00:16:47.644 --> 00:16:51.215
I don't think it would do well
to breed him with the American, Warsaw.

00:16:51.281 --> 00:16:55.285
However, we have to pass on
Hope's power to the next generation.

00:16:55.352 --> 00:16:59.089
No, Mr. Kurisu.
I'm not saying he doesn't have options.

00:17:00.724 --> 00:17:04.061
Among the broodmares
owned by the President,

00:17:04.127 --> 00:17:07.164
there is one horse that I think
would be a good fit for Royal Hope.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:12.736
This is a hypothetical situation.

00:17:13.403 --> 00:17:15.739
If I were to inherit
one of the President's horses,

00:17:16.807 --> 00:17:21.111
I would definitely want to inherit
the one born of those two horses.

00:17:21.945 --> 00:17:23.213
Hope's foal?

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.114
Yes.

00:17:24.681 --> 00:17:26.583
-Wait a minute.
-Which horse is it?

00:17:27.117 --> 00:17:28.318
I want to know first.

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.754
This horse.

00:17:32.122 --> 00:17:34.324
She's old, but…

00:17:39.696 --> 00:17:40.697
Royal Happiness.

00:17:40.764 --> 00:17:43.200
ROYAL HAPPINESS

00:17:44.134 --> 00:17:47.771
With this horse, there is no concern,
no matter how far back you go.

00:17:48.839 --> 00:17:52.743
If you want to make use of Hope's power,
Royal Happiness is the best choice.

00:17:54.044 --> 00:17:55.012
Are you…

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:57.548
saying this, knowing that?

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:01.885
Knowing what?

00:18:03.687 --> 00:18:05.355
Royal Happiness…

00:18:07.124 --> 00:18:09.159
was the horse your mother chose.

00:18:09.726 --> 00:18:11.762
Royal Happiness.

00:18:14.298 --> 00:18:18.502
This is the broodmare
chosen by Mikiko Nakajo

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:20.637
for the President.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.208
If it's her foal,

00:18:25.676 --> 00:18:27.277
will you inherit it?

00:18:29.546 --> 00:18:31.682
Hope and Happiness' foal…

00:18:34.651 --> 00:18:37.387
Is a horse that only you can receive.

00:18:40.924 --> 00:18:42.693
May I?

00:18:44.061 --> 00:18:45.862
The horses eligible for inheritance

00:18:45.929 --> 00:18:48.599
are those the previous owner
registered as racehorses.

00:18:49.733 --> 00:18:53.170
Even if we inseminate her now,
the foal won't be born until next year.

00:18:54.338 --> 00:18:58.008
It will take about two years after that
before it can be registered.

00:18:59.109 --> 00:19:02.946
This means we'll have to wait
three years before he can inherit it.

00:19:09.152 --> 00:19:10.220
In that case…

00:19:15.225 --> 00:19:16.593
you need to stay alive.

00:19:25.068 --> 00:19:26.403
Three more years…

00:19:28.272 --> 00:19:29.406
Stay alive that long.

00:19:33.377 --> 00:19:36.880
Until the horse bred from Hope
and Happiness is handed over to me.

00:19:38.048 --> 00:19:39.883
Until the day it becomes a racehorse,

00:19:42.753 --> 00:19:44.454
promise me you'll stay alive.

00:19:48.558 --> 00:19:49.660
Don't be stupid.

00:19:50.827 --> 00:19:52.663
It won't be until I hand them over to you.

00:19:54.498 --> 00:19:55.966
But until that horse…

00:19:58.035 --> 00:19:59.269
finishes first.

00:20:04.741 --> 00:20:06.376
Don't just kill me off.

00:20:11.081 --> 00:20:12.015
Okay.

00:20:20.023 --> 00:20:21.958
ROYAL IZANA, ROYAL HAPPINESS,
ROYAL FIGHT, ROYAL HOPE

00:20:22.025 --> 00:20:25.962
So the only thing
he will inherit is the horses?

00:20:26.029 --> 00:20:27.964
He will not be involved in anything else?

00:20:28.031 --> 00:20:29.733
Can you promise me that?

00:20:30.701 --> 00:20:32.235
-Yes.
-Well…

00:20:33.136 --> 00:20:35.739
I had no intention
of inheriting them to begin with.

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:40.711
It's fine with me. What do you think?

00:20:42.379 --> 00:20:43.613
Do as you like.

00:20:45.615 --> 00:20:47.050
Thank you very much.

00:20:49.353 --> 00:20:50.253
Okay, then.

00:20:50.821 --> 00:20:52.989
I will be present
when the documents are prepared.

00:20:53.056 --> 00:20:55.392
-Understood.
-How cruel.

00:20:55.459 --> 00:20:59.129
I can't believe you'll be continuing
his treatment for three more years.

00:21:16.913 --> 00:21:18.115
How is it?

00:21:18.181 --> 00:21:20.050
Amazing! Dad!

00:21:20.117 --> 00:21:21.818
-Kanako.
-Yes.

00:21:28.625 --> 00:21:30.127
Happiness.

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:32.429
You did great.

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:36.099
-Kanako, it's a colt.
-Oh, wow.

00:21:38.535 --> 00:21:40.470
-Here.
-Okay.

00:21:44.107 --> 00:21:45.275
Oh, my!

00:21:45.342 --> 00:21:48.478
They're both healthy!
Happiness and the colt!

00:21:49.246 --> 00:21:52.649
This is Hope's first colt!

00:21:52.716 --> 00:21:54.251
Congratulations.

00:21:56.753 --> 00:21:58.188
You two…

00:21:59.256 --> 00:22:00.357
Go and meet them.

00:22:01.091 --> 00:22:02.192
Okay.

00:22:02.259 --> 00:22:03.393
Understood.

00:22:05.328 --> 00:22:07.063
Kanako, thank you.

00:22:09.566 --> 00:22:13.770
I still have the naming rights
to this horse, right?

00:22:14.604 --> 00:22:15.439
Yes.

00:22:18.942 --> 00:22:20.110
In that case,

00:22:21.745 --> 00:22:23.413
I'll name him "Family."

00:22:25.148 --> 00:22:26.583
"Royal Family."

00:22:29.019 --> 00:22:31.788
Family will get us what we are missing.

00:22:32.689 --> 00:22:33.657
The Arima Kinen.

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:37.961
Yes.

00:23:12.796 --> 00:23:14.097
Come here.

00:23:14.164 --> 00:23:15.131
Come here.

00:23:22.405 --> 00:23:24.374
Yes.

00:23:24.441 --> 00:23:25.542
Good.

00:23:28.879 --> 00:23:29.913
Family.

00:23:40.924 --> 00:23:41.758
Nice to meet you.

00:23:44.461 --> 00:23:45.495
Family.

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:57.240
Yes, that's good. Right?

00:24:01.044 --> 00:24:04.781
After that, another year passed by.

00:24:04.848 --> 00:24:06.383
Sixth race, lane eight.

00:24:06.449 --> 00:24:07.551
Spring.

00:24:07.617 --> 00:24:10.020
Horses weren't the only ones
making their debut.

00:24:13.356 --> 00:24:14.824
Sixth race, lane five.

00:24:14.891 --> 00:24:15.926
Okay.

00:24:18.361 --> 00:24:19.763
-Shohei.
-Yes?

00:24:19.829 --> 00:24:21.364
-Do your best.
-Thank you.

00:24:21.431 --> 00:24:24.467
-Okay.
-Sixth race, lane six.

00:24:26.503 --> 00:24:27.504
Okay.

00:24:33.143 --> 00:24:34.844
…they cross the line together!

00:24:37.614 --> 00:24:39.115
How did Shohei do?

00:24:39.182 --> 00:24:41.384
-Hey! How did he do?
-I don't know.

00:24:42.352 --> 00:24:45.255
-What's with that?
-The horses were tightly packed.

00:24:45.822 --> 00:24:47.190
He wasn't first place.

00:24:48.892 --> 00:24:50.694
The way you say it…

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:54.130
But, he finished safely. I'm glad.

00:24:58.602 --> 00:24:59.869
Shohei.

00:25:01.237 --> 00:25:04.941
The only people who paid attention
to the debut of newcomer Shohei Nozaki

00:25:05.008 --> 00:25:05.842
were his family.

00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:09.779
It was a quiet, unremarkable debut.

00:25:15.752 --> 00:25:17.621
Hey, it's Grandpa.

00:25:17.687 --> 00:25:18.989
He has nice eyes, right?

00:25:20.757 --> 00:25:22.492
He takes after me.

00:25:22.559 --> 00:25:23.827
Stop, will you?

00:25:23.893 --> 00:25:25.161
How soft.

00:25:25.228 --> 00:25:26.129
RYUJIRO AND YURIKO'S SON

00:25:26.196 --> 00:25:27.831
-Such a good boy.
-He's so cute.

00:25:28.932 --> 00:25:30.033
Oh, no!

00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:31.101
It's fine.

00:25:31.167 --> 00:25:33.703
I'll take a walk around the area
after changing his diaper.

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:34.838
Come here.

00:25:36.973 --> 00:25:38.908
-Call me.
-Okay, take care.

00:25:38.975 --> 00:25:41.311
That's impressive. He must be busy.

00:25:41.911 --> 00:25:44.714
I think you are the busy one.

00:25:44.781 --> 00:25:47.917
And yet you always
find an excuse to meet Kotaro.

00:25:48.518 --> 00:25:50.520
It's strange, even to me.

00:25:51.154 --> 00:25:53.223
Originally, I'm not good with kids.

00:25:53.289 --> 00:25:54.724
I was, too.

00:25:55.692 --> 00:25:58.695
When I was young, I thought, "A kid, huh?"

00:25:59.295 --> 00:26:02.399
"I'll never call you cute,
even if I die," I thought.

00:26:03.967 --> 00:26:05.368
It's all thanks to you.

00:26:06.403 --> 00:26:08.004
My way of thinking changed.

00:26:09.272 --> 00:26:11.474
What? Have you been told you're cute?

00:26:11.541 --> 00:26:12.976
I don't remember.

00:26:13.476 --> 00:26:15.045
Even so, it has been decades.

00:26:15.111 --> 00:26:17.847
Mom, has he told me that I'm cute?

00:26:18.415 --> 00:26:20.784
I forgot if I said it or not.

00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:22.952
-But I was thinking it.
-What?

00:26:23.687 --> 00:26:25.021
-I thought it.
-You…

00:26:25.088 --> 00:26:26.589
-You need to tell us.
-Yes?

00:26:30.694 --> 00:26:32.028
Oh, come in.

00:26:33.296 --> 00:26:37.634
Pardon me for disturbing your family time.

00:26:39.302 --> 00:26:41.204
I heard from Mr. Kurisu

00:26:41.971 --> 00:26:44.274
that your son will inherit it.

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:45.942
He's still young, but…

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:48.578
he understands horses more than I do.

00:26:50.013 --> 00:26:51.414
Oh, my.

00:26:52.348 --> 00:26:55.552
I also have a son,

00:26:56.386 --> 00:26:59.789
and lately, he's been saying that he wants
to become a horse owner.

00:27:00.523 --> 00:27:03.493
That's good. He earns his money, right?

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:05.962
Yes, he has met the requirements…

00:27:07.597 --> 00:27:09.065
You don't want him to do it?

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:12.068
I didn't say that.

00:27:12.135 --> 00:27:13.002
Afraid to lose?

00:27:13.069 --> 00:27:14.170
I'm not afraid.

00:27:15.405 --> 00:27:19.309
But I can't just lose so easily.

00:27:23.179 --> 00:27:26.182
Battles that cannot be lost will continue.

00:27:26.249 --> 00:27:29.185
When I think about it, I feel overwhelmed.

00:27:30.153 --> 00:27:34.457
I was utterly absorbed
in competing with you every day.

00:27:36.559 --> 00:27:37.894
It's going to be all right.

00:27:38.728 --> 00:27:40.029
A child grows.

00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:41.831
You should let him do it.

00:27:42.866 --> 00:27:43.700
Yes.

00:27:47.704 --> 00:27:50.807
I never said such silly things before.

00:27:52.375 --> 00:27:55.044
Maybe I've matured a little bit.

00:28:01.885 --> 00:28:02.819
President.

00:28:03.987 --> 00:28:06.389
There's something
I'd like to consult with you about.

00:28:09.993 --> 00:28:12.796
I'm still immature, you see.

00:28:15.331 --> 00:28:20.170
Similarly, few racing insiders
paid much attention

00:28:20.737 --> 00:28:22.806
to Royal Hope's first born.

00:28:22.872 --> 00:28:24.274
That hurts, Family!

00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:25.275
What's the matter?

00:28:25.341 --> 00:28:27.443
He got scared of the puddle.

00:28:29.245 --> 00:28:30.880
Sorry, he's incredibly timid.

00:28:30.947 --> 00:28:32.081
And he bites!

00:28:34.751 --> 00:28:36.619
We've had horses like this before.

00:28:36.686 --> 00:28:39.522
In the meantime,
let's pair him with Shohei.

00:28:41.257 --> 00:28:42.826
-It's hot.
-It's okay.

00:28:44.394 --> 00:28:46.396
-Oh, it's good.
-Okay?

00:28:47.397 --> 00:28:48.731
All right.

00:28:51.701 --> 00:28:53.203
How's Shohei?

00:28:53.803 --> 00:28:54.871
He's doing his best.

00:29:01.077 --> 00:29:05.682
He's hit-or-miss, isn't he?
He's really good when he does do well.

00:29:06.416 --> 00:29:09.085
It's his first year. It can't be helped.

00:29:12.856 --> 00:29:16.125
How about you see him?
I think you should support him in person.

00:29:21.698 --> 00:29:22.866
You know…

00:29:25.068 --> 00:29:26.502
When I was watching

00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:30.473
Shohei's back after his debut race,

00:29:32.942 --> 00:29:34.010
I thought,

00:29:36.179 --> 00:29:38.615
"Oh, this was my child, right?"

00:29:40.183 --> 00:29:43.786
I was struck by that feeling.

00:29:52.095 --> 00:29:53.463
I was happy.

00:29:57.367 --> 00:29:58.201
But…

00:30:02.372 --> 00:30:04.807
I realized that we're growing
separately as people.

00:30:08.945 --> 00:30:10.747
I'm the one…

00:30:12.315 --> 00:30:14.317
who needs to grow up fast.

00:30:17.987 --> 00:30:19.322
I'll help.

00:30:21.257 --> 00:30:22.759
Let's do our best.

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:38.308
Thank you.

00:30:50.687 --> 00:30:51.821
Excuse us.

00:30:52.622 --> 00:30:53.656
President.

00:30:54.857 --> 00:30:56.626
I've brought Koichi.

00:31:01.397 --> 00:31:04.100
President, congratulations.

00:31:04.867 --> 00:31:08.871
Today, we registered
Royal Family as a racehorse.

00:31:08.938 --> 00:31:10.273
Thank you very much.

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:18.781
Here you go.

00:31:22.518 --> 00:31:24.454
I haven't handed it to you yet.

00:31:25.621 --> 00:31:29.425
As my representative,
make sure he wins his debut race.

00:31:32.662 --> 00:31:33.863
Of course.

00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:43.573
His temper is worse than Hope's,

00:31:44.173 --> 00:31:46.309
but he has agility.

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:50.446
Once the new year begins,
we'll put him in an outside stable.

00:31:50.513 --> 00:31:53.516
He needs to be ridden
as much as possible before his debut.

00:31:53.583 --> 00:31:54.617
Please do.

00:31:54.684 --> 00:31:59.689
Also, please leave open the possibility
of focusing on short distances.

00:32:00.256 --> 00:32:02.892
-What?
-To make use of his agility.

00:32:03.559 --> 00:32:06.829
If it's a short-distance race,
it might work well with his temper.

00:32:06.896 --> 00:32:09.832
Please wait a minute.
We can't do short-distance races.

00:32:10.733 --> 00:32:11.868
-What?
-I mean…

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:15.772
I'm sorry. I'm just an amateur.

00:32:16.706 --> 00:32:20.543
I never thought the day would come
when I'd say something like this to you.

00:32:22.745 --> 00:32:25.982
The Arima Kinen
is a long-distance race of 2,500 meters.

00:32:26.482 --> 00:32:28.151
Even if he wins in short-distance races,

00:32:28.217 --> 00:32:30.520
I don't think he'll be able to win
at the crucial Arima race.

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:34.357
Our goal is to win
the Arima which Hope didn't win,

00:32:34.424 --> 00:32:35.992
with Family, right?

00:32:36.559 --> 00:32:37.393
So…

00:32:38.494 --> 00:32:39.896
I'm sorry, but…

00:32:43.499 --> 00:32:44.634
We can't do short-distance.

00:32:48.604 --> 00:32:51.507
Understood. We'll keep exploring.

00:32:54.077 --> 00:32:55.645
Shall we try the shadow roll?

00:32:56.345 --> 00:32:58.514
What? I don't think he's going to like it.

00:32:58.581 --> 00:32:59.782
I'll try it.

00:33:08.224 --> 00:33:09.592
Are you not cold?

00:33:13.696 --> 00:33:16.032
How is Koichi's thesis going?

00:33:17.366 --> 00:33:18.734
I wonder.

00:33:19.602 --> 00:33:22.939
He said he'd come
if he had the time and yet…

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:27.276
How long is he staying in that university?

00:33:28.211 --> 00:33:29.512
It is a graduate school.

00:33:30.079 --> 00:33:32.782
He's not repeating the year,
so don't worry.

00:33:33.549 --> 00:33:36.018
I wanted to get out into society
as soon as possible.

00:33:38.821 --> 00:33:42.191
I was only thinking about making money.

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:48.464
"The accumulation of all that effort
led me to the horses," right?

00:33:51.634 --> 00:33:52.935
And now,

00:33:54.036 --> 00:33:56.205
I can't imagine any other life.

00:34:00.910 --> 00:34:02.044
Me too.

00:34:06.549 --> 00:34:08.518
Let's wait for Family here.

00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:23.733
I dream a lot these days.

00:34:26.002 --> 00:34:27.870
I dream of winning the Arima.

00:34:32.175 --> 00:34:34.710
I still haven't given up.

00:34:42.718 --> 00:34:44.086
I'll say this first.

00:34:46.155 --> 00:34:47.190
If…

00:34:48.424 --> 00:34:50.893
I appear in your dreams,

00:34:53.362 --> 00:34:55.231
don't think of me as a bother.

00:35:03.973 --> 00:35:05.074
That's…

00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:12.381
Understood.

00:35:21.924 --> 00:35:24.393
I was an ordinary horse owner,

00:35:27.396 --> 00:35:31.634
but getting you onto this path
was a great achievement.

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:12.541
What a great smell.

00:36:22.051 --> 00:36:24.954
1800M ON TURF

00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:28.858
Good morning.

00:36:29.625 --> 00:36:31.127
-This one.
-Okay.

00:36:31.193 --> 00:36:33.429
-For two, please.
-Understood.

00:36:34.063 --> 00:36:35.765
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

00:36:37.199 --> 00:36:40.269
The President had been planning
to come here today,

00:36:40.336 --> 00:36:42.405
but he was not feeling well.

00:36:42.471 --> 00:36:44.440
Can he watch the live broadcast?

00:36:44.507 --> 00:36:46.475
He's with his family.

00:36:46.542 --> 00:36:48.477
If he's not sleeping,
I'm sure he's watching.

00:36:48.544 --> 00:36:50.479
Dad?

00:36:50.546 --> 00:36:51.814
Mr. Sanno!

00:36:51.881 --> 00:36:55.217
Can you hear me?
Mr. Sanno, do you recognize me?

00:36:55.284 --> 00:36:57.753
THE WINNER'S CIRCLE

00:36:59.021 --> 00:37:00.456
Is it okay?

00:37:01.257 --> 00:37:03.192
For me, a representative, to be here?

00:37:04.694 --> 00:37:07.029
It's the horse you picked.

00:37:07.096 --> 00:37:08.864
Please be confident.

00:37:08.931 --> 00:37:11.967
Hope! It's Family's debut!

00:37:12.034 --> 00:37:17.473
The 100m was thrown
into chaos due to heavy rainfall.

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:19.275
-Next up we have…
-Let's do our best, okay?

00:37:20.876 --> 00:37:23.446
You went all the way to the training
center to check up on Family?

00:37:23.512 --> 00:37:25.481
Sorry for overstepping.

00:37:25.548 --> 00:37:27.283
Hironaka made you ride him, right?

00:37:28.184 --> 00:37:32.421
-What did you think after riding him?
-Moody, and he has a bad temper.

00:37:33.122 --> 00:37:34.256
But, how do I put it?

00:37:35.358 --> 00:37:38.160
He doesn't believe
that he'll take first place.

00:37:39.895 --> 00:37:41.030
You're right.

00:37:41.664 --> 00:37:44.266
Both the rider and horse
must first realize their own strength.

00:37:45.134 --> 00:37:47.737
For the President's sake, we'll win.

00:37:52.875 --> 00:37:54.543
-Can you hear me?
-Mr. Sanno!

00:37:55.077 --> 00:37:57.079
-Mr. Sanno, can you hear us?
-Yutaro.

00:37:57.146 --> 00:37:58.347
Yutaro.

00:37:58.414 --> 00:38:02.318
Come, quick. Tell Mom, too.

00:38:02.385 --> 00:38:03.686
Please tell her.

00:38:05.221 --> 00:38:09.458
I wonder how he felt when seeing them off.

00:38:09.525 --> 00:38:11.460
-Dad.
-Tokyo Racecourse, fifth race.

00:38:11.527 --> 00:38:14.463
-Make Debut Tokyo Two-Year-Old.
-Dad, the race is starting.

00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:17.233
-Family, you can do this.
-The 12 runners are entering the track.

00:38:17.299 --> 00:38:19.468
Dad, Family's going to run.

00:38:20.035 --> 00:38:21.404
Dad, watch!

00:38:24.373 --> 00:38:26.475
-The doctor? Where is he?
-We'll explain.

00:38:26.542 --> 00:38:27.309
Mom…

00:38:27.877 --> 00:38:29.311
What is his condition?

00:38:35.518 --> 00:38:39.088
What are you doing?
Connect it to the broadcast! Quickly!

00:38:39.789 --> 00:38:41.390
Elena S. Henry.

00:38:41.457 --> 00:38:45.795
Sired by Mezobach, 434 kilograms,
ridden by Norifumi Yokota.

00:38:45.861 --> 00:38:48.230
Number Five, Nekowan Pence.

00:38:48.297 --> 00:38:52.368
Sired by Making House, 464 kilograms,
ridden by Shota Kisaki.

00:38:52.435 --> 00:38:55.371
-Do you want some?
-Number Six, Dip Babylon.

00:38:55.971 --> 00:39:00.009
Sired by Valshare, 444 kilograms,
ridden by Ryusei Sakai.

00:39:00.075 --> 00:39:00.910
There, there.

00:39:00.976 --> 00:39:02.845
Face right and let go, please.

00:39:02.912 --> 00:39:04.480
-Ridden by Yuki Takeda.
-Dad.

00:39:04.547 --> 00:39:06.882
Number 12, Royal Family.

00:39:06.949 --> 00:39:12.254
Sired by Royal Hope, 430 kilograms,
ridden by Ryujiro Saki.

00:39:12.321 --> 00:39:14.323
These are the 12 horses for today.

00:39:15.925 --> 00:39:18.160
-Dad!
-Tokyo Racecourse, fifth race.

00:39:18.227 --> 00:39:20.663
-Watch, please watch!
-Make Debut Tokyo Two-Year-Old.

00:39:20.729 --> 00:39:24.366
-Darling.
-A 1,800 meter turf, twelve horse race.

00:39:24.433 --> 00:39:27.770
The starting gate is set up
at the entrance to the backstretch.

00:39:27.837 --> 00:39:31.440
The turf is slippery due
to the continuous rainfall last night.

00:39:32.007 --> 00:39:35.945
The jockeys' decision-making skills
will be tested by the damaged inner track.

00:39:36.011 --> 00:39:39.448
Dip will get the win Valshare didn't.

00:39:39.515 --> 00:39:43.452
They have entered the gate,
and the attendants have left.

00:39:45.621 --> 00:39:46.722
The race has started!

00:39:46.789 --> 00:39:48.791
All twelve horses set off together!

00:39:48.858 --> 00:39:51.627
Number 12, Royal Family, started late!

00:39:51.694 --> 00:39:54.463
In the pink helmet,
Royal Family takes after his sire!

00:39:54.530 --> 00:39:56.799
He didn't need to inherit that.

00:39:56.866 --> 00:40:00.069
Dip Babylon, sired by Valshare
is in a good position.

00:40:00.903 --> 00:40:02.972
It's okay. You're fast.

00:40:03.038 --> 00:40:04.740
Number One, Routh O. Heart, is leading.

00:40:04.807 --> 00:40:06.475
Next is Number Six, Dip Babylon,

00:40:06.542 --> 00:40:09.245
neck and neck
with Number Nine, Hourai Harlan.

00:40:09.311 --> 00:40:11.947
Two lengths behind
is Number Eight, Oliver Kiss.

00:40:12.014 --> 00:40:14.149
On the inside is Number Seven, Charlmino.

00:40:14.216 --> 00:40:17.152
The condition of the inner track
has them running slightly wider.

00:40:17.219 --> 00:40:19.288
The first 600 meters
were run in 36 seconds.

00:40:19.355 --> 00:40:21.323
-Can you see?
-He knows.

00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:24.927
Five lengths behind the mid-pack
is Number 11, Lucky Glamis.

00:40:24.994 --> 00:40:29.198
Behind them is Number Two, Laia Ryoran,
neck and neck with Number Three, Kobre.

00:40:29.265 --> 00:40:31.500
And Number 12, Royal Family, who was last…

00:40:31.567 --> 00:40:33.802
-He's here!
-He's close to the inner track.

00:40:33.869 --> 00:40:38.874
Saki powers through the rough track.
Royal Family advances on the inside.

00:40:38.941 --> 00:40:41.577
-They're now approaching the third corner.
-Yes!

00:40:42.711 --> 00:40:45.414
We'll show the President, Family!

00:40:46.615 --> 00:40:48.317
You're seeing this, right?

00:40:48.384 --> 00:40:50.486
1,000 meters remain.

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:53.355
Number 12, Royal Family, is moving up.

00:40:53.422 --> 00:40:55.124
Number One, Routh O. Heart,
is running for it.

00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:57.760
Number Six, Dip Babylon,
is in a good position in second place.

00:40:57.826 --> 00:41:00.763
And only one-length away, Number 12,
Royal Family, has risen to third place.

00:41:00.829 --> 00:41:03.766
We're in the middle of the third
and fourth corners…

00:41:03.832 --> 00:41:07.403
Number Eight, Oliver Kiss, comes up to
fourth place lining up with Royal Family.

00:41:07.469 --> 00:41:09.138
They're very similar.

00:41:09.204 --> 00:41:13.042
Approaching the final corner.
The frontrunners are settled! 800 meters…

00:41:13.108 --> 00:41:15.444
-Ryujiro, move to the outside!
-Get out of there, Ryu.

00:41:17.379 --> 00:41:18.380
I can't get out.

00:41:18.447 --> 00:41:22.217
Leading is Routh O. Heart,
Sakai makes his move with Dip Babylon.

00:41:22.284 --> 00:41:23.619
They are only one half-length away.

00:41:23.686 --> 00:41:25.254
Oliver Kiss is also coming up…

00:41:25.321 --> 00:41:28.057
-On the inside is Royal Family!
-This is it, Family!

00:41:28.123 --> 00:41:30.092
-He's coming up!
-Dad!

00:41:30.159 --> 00:41:32.461
-They are in the fourth corner.
-Come on, Family!

00:41:32.528 --> 00:41:33.829
Go, Family!

00:41:33.896 --> 00:41:36.699
Fan favorite, Dip Babylon,
advances towards the lead.

00:41:36.765 --> 00:41:39.768
-Go, Family!
-Can Dip Babylon meet fan expectations?

00:41:39.835 --> 00:41:42.805
He gains a length!
Dip Babylon takes the lead.

00:41:42.871 --> 00:41:44.039
Now!

00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:48.544
Number 12, Royal Family,
is steadily making advances.

00:41:48.611 --> 00:41:51.847
Dip Babylon is living up to his title
of fan favorite on the track!

00:41:51.914 --> 00:41:53.349
Will one of the others take first?

00:41:53.415 --> 00:41:55.951
Royal Family is speeding up.

00:41:56.752 --> 00:41:58.320
The green helmet is in the lead.

00:41:58.387 --> 00:41:59.221
Go!

00:41:59.288 --> 00:42:01.924
Royal Family overtakes from the inside.

00:42:01.991 --> 00:42:05.894
Royal Family has advanced
towards the lead!

00:42:05.961 --> 00:42:07.496
Please, Ryusei! Hang on!

00:42:07.563 --> 00:42:09.465
Will they line up? He's advancing!

00:42:09.531 --> 00:42:12.468
They have lined up. He overtakes…

00:42:12.534 --> 00:42:16.605
Royal Family takes the lead!

00:42:16.672 --> 00:42:18.173
Go! Family!

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:19.575
-Good.
-Okay.

00:42:19.642 --> 00:42:22.011
Royal Family took the lead! What speed!

00:42:22.077 --> 00:42:25.481
He is creating a two,
now three-length distance.

00:42:25.547 --> 00:42:28.951
Will Dip Babylon catch up?

00:42:29.018 --> 00:42:30.519
What a gap!

00:42:30.586 --> 00:42:33.856
Royal Family is displaying
some incredible speed!

00:42:33.922 --> 00:42:35.591
Dip Babylon can't catch up!

00:42:35.658 --> 00:42:38.127
And Royal Family wins!

00:42:39.061 --> 00:42:40.462
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:42:40.529 --> 00:42:42.865
Number 12, Royal Family!

00:42:43.599 --> 00:42:45.000
We did it!

00:42:46.168 --> 00:42:47.136
Thank goodness!

00:42:48.137 --> 00:42:49.405
He did it!

00:42:50.339 --> 00:42:52.207
Dad, we won!

00:42:52.274 --> 00:42:53.208
We won!

00:42:54.176 --> 00:42:55.277
Okay!

00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:03.485
I have decided on the article's title.

00:43:05.387 --> 00:43:06.522
You need to take over.

00:43:06.588 --> 00:43:07.523
Yes!

00:43:07.589 --> 00:43:08.957
"Inheritance."

00:43:12.161 --> 00:43:13.529
Congratulations.

00:43:21.370 --> 00:43:23.005
It was great.

00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:26.475
It was great.

00:43:37.886 --> 00:43:38.787
Okay.

00:43:38.854 --> 00:43:39.755
Koichi!

00:43:39.822 --> 00:43:41.290
Koichi! Here!

00:43:41.356 --> 00:43:43.125
-No, I'm fine here.
-Thank you.

00:43:43.192 --> 00:43:44.993
Come on! You're the representative!

00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:46.929
-No, I'm fine.
-Let's go.

00:43:46.995 --> 00:43:48.697
Um, Mr. Kurisu is…

00:43:50.199 --> 00:43:53.302
Mr. Kurisu,
could you please go in my place?

00:44:01.977 --> 00:44:03.045
Mr. Kurisu?

00:44:23.432 --> 00:44:25.267
The one standing beside Family,

00:44:27.269 --> 00:44:28.604
should be you, Koichi.

00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:33.008
From this moment on,

00:44:37.412 --> 00:44:38.714
Family's owner…

00:44:42.217 --> 00:44:44.052
is you, Koichi.

00:44:50.659 --> 00:44:52.528
Horse Owner, please come.

00:44:56.632 --> 00:45:00.102
Congratulations on your debut.

00:45:04.173 --> 00:45:05.240
Let's go.

00:45:22.991 --> 00:45:24.960
Everyone, please look here.

00:45:25.828 --> 00:45:27.196
Smile!

00:45:32.835 --> 00:45:34.303
Congratulations.

00:45:39.074 --> 00:45:41.443
You can learn from everything
you witness here.

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:43.312
I want to connect
with owners around my age.

00:45:43.378 --> 00:45:45.848
-They don't want to take responsibility.
-Let's do as we please.

00:45:45.914 --> 00:45:48.550
I want to win no matter what.

00:45:49.117 --> 00:45:50.152
