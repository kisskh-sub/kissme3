00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:47.620
Cen Jin.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.870
Cen Jin!

00:01:49.977 --> 00:01:51.488
Do you even know what you're doing?

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.670
Do you not recognize her?

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.950
I do.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.220
Since when are you two so close?

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:57.860
How come I never know?

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.030
Can you stop being ridiculous?

00:01:59.066 --> 00:02:00.420
I was talking about work just now.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.260
Can't you tell?

00:02:01.466 --> 00:02:03.488
What good does it do you
to offend the client?

00:02:03.555 --> 00:02:04.839
Do you want the whole team

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.066
to clean up after your tantrum?

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.340
Princess,

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.180
stop living in a bubble.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.900
The world doesn't revolve

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:11.990
around you, okay?

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.910
What did you say?

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.540
What did I say?

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.180
You're a top journalism graduate.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.488
You really don't understand?

00:02:26.777 --> 00:02:28.370
Forget it.
Let's take things down a notch.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.711
We'll talk after we cool off.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.910
Wu Fu.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.700
Why do you have to say
such hurtful things?

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.550
My health wasn't good recently.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:39.700
I was down.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.460
We kept fighting,

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.580
but we've been together

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:44.420
since college.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.790
After all these years...

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:46.630
Cen Jin.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.700
Losing the baby hurts me.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.350
It hurts you?

00:02:51.511 --> 00:02:52.866
You think it didn't hurt me?

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.860
You're not the only one
who lost a child.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.980
I thought

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.180
we could help each other

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.510
through this tough time.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:03.533
Alright, that's enough.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:04.740
I'm fed up.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.700
I can't keep going anymore.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.830
All these years,

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:12.860
I've been trying

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:13.790
to silence those people

00:03:13.822 --> 00:03:15.466
who say I'm not good enough for you.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:17.700
I've been taking care of you

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.350
and your parents' feelings.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.350
(I don't know)

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:22.580
(what I want anymore.)

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.540
(Cen Jin,)

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.860
(I regret it.)

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.070
(I regret not leaving you earlier.)

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.860
(At least,)

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:37.670
(I wouldn't have lost the child.)

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.950
Sorry.

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:55.790
It's okay.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.900
Sister.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:40.430
Jin.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:41.740
Dad, why are you here?

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:43.660
Mr. Cen.

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.910
Wu, it's been a while. You've grown taller.

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:54.860
Your mom asked me

00:04:54.888 --> 00:04:56.088
to bring something over.

00:04:57.422 --> 00:04:58.900
- I'll take it.
- No, it's heavy.

00:04:59.133 --> 00:05:00.466
- I'll take it.
- Let Wu carry it.

00:05:00.488 --> 00:05:01.511
Yes, let him.

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:07.250
Li Wu, come here.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.500
Put this on the table.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.710
Let me tell you.

00:05:11.577 --> 00:05:12.820
There's rice and dishes in here.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.590
Eat while it's hot.

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:17.430
And these

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.500
are steamed dumplings
Cen Jin's mom made.

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:20.630
Try them.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:22.260
Taste this first.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.340
I'm not sure

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.044
how far you've gotten
with your revision.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.230
Here's some study material.

00:05:27.266 --> 00:05:29.111
(NCEE Must-Do Workbook)
Practice whenever you have time.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.990
Okay.

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:32.510
Thank you, Mr. Cen.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.900
Please sit.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.150
You eat first. I need to talk to Jin.

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.990
Alright.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.140
Sit down and eat.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.140
Go on and eat.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:41.900
Jin, come with me.

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:04.790
Qi's repeat-year program

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:05.790
is the best in Yi City.

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.830
I've talked to them.

00:06:06.888 --> 00:06:08.933
You can take him over
the day after tomorrow.

00:06:10.177 --> 00:06:12.088
Does he need to provide any documents

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:13.940
from his previous school?

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.777
Qi said it's fine since he already
graduated from high school.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.550
He contacted someone at Yunfeng.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.844
The paperwork isn't complicated.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.260
Just go to the school

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.740
and pick up his student record.

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:27.460
The repeat class

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:28.300
has started.

00:06:28.577 --> 00:06:31.020
Take him there
and let him get familiar with the place.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:32.980
If this boy is really good,

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:34.340
we can't afford to

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:35.460
delay his studies.

00:06:40.355 --> 00:06:41.666
You're going back to work

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:43.860
in a few days.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.140
Shouldn't you rest a little longer?

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.380
Your health matters the most.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:01.580
Dad.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:05.460
Wu Fu and I

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:07.900
might really get divorced.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:21.420
Can you tell me why?

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:24.900
I think the problem

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:25.980
started long ago.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.180
I just never realized it.

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:33.300
After we lost the baby,

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:35.620
we kept fighting.

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:39.780
But I thought

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.066
everything would be fine
after he calmed down.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.340
I didn't expect

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:45.820
he'd been holding so much resentment.

00:07:47.511 --> 00:07:48.980
So much so that he wants a divorce.

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:51.020
Jin,

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.140
there's no marriage

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:55.660
without conflict.

00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:58.900
Happiness takes effort

00:07:58.900 --> 00:07:59.860
from both sides.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:01.340
Both of you need to

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:03.820
accept each other's differences

00:08:04.222 --> 00:08:05.420
and have the determination

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:06.500
to move forward together.

00:08:07.133 --> 00:08:09.044
Do you still want to continue this
with him?

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:11.820
He's already asked me for a divorce.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:13.780
What can I do?

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:18.220
But when I imagine

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.060
a future

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:22.900
without him,

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:27.940
I don't know how to accept this.

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:32.900
I don't know what to do, Dad.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:33.740
I honestly don't.

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:41.620
Jin,

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:43.700
this is something

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:45.500
I can't solve for you.

00:08:45.688 --> 00:08:47.577
Marriage is a choice made by two people.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:50.100
But don't let this

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:51.980
make you

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:52.820
doubt yourself.

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:56.300
Life won't always go smoothly.

00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:58.580
If work drains you, you can quit.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:00.580
If marriage hurts you,

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.020
you can end it.

00:09:02.555 --> 00:09:04.400
What matters is the courage to choose.

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:09.260
Of course,

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:10.220
you must

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:11.380
be responsible

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:12.533
for whatever you choose.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.860
If there's still a chance,

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.620
try to work it out.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:18.580
If not,

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:20.620
there's no need

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:21.888
to drag each other down.

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:27.180
Divorce isn't a small matter.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:28.580
Think carefully.

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:32.420
But whatever happens,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:35.820
your mom and I will always be here.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:55.220
Alright.

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:56.220
I should get going.

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:01.220
Take care of yourself.

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:03.600
The food your mom
prepared is in the fridge.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.860
Remember to eat.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:07.460
I will.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:09.420
Since Li Wu is staying here,

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.020
it's a bit inconvenient.

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:12.540
Why not let him stay with me?

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:13.900
I can tutor him

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:15.860
when I'm free.

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:22.060
It's okay.

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:23.260
Mom's still mad at me.

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:24.620
Better not send him over.

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:26.380
He'll be going to school

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:27.420
in a couple of days anyway.

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:29.660
All right, then.

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:30.860
Remember

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:32.540
to call

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:33.380
your mom.

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:35.540
Sometimes,

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:36.260
she gets anxious

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:37.380
and says harsh things,

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:38.940
but she means well.

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:41.220
She just worries you're not doing well.

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:42.860
All right.

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:44.620
Okay. I'm off.

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:45.780
See you, Mr. Cen.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.377
(Conference Room)

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.460
(Sampling Data Analysis.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:25.340
(The Future Has Arrived)

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:27.100
And that's our proposal so far.

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:33.300
The slogan "The Future Has Arrived"

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:34.980
fits our brand concept quite well.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:36.660
Sorry, may I ask something?

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:38.300
Is the data

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:39.740
we're using for field research

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:41.420
based on old statistics from online?

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:43.380
If it's not up to date,

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:44.220
how can we ensure

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:45.580
it's actually feasible?

00:11:45.644 --> 00:11:47.466
Mr. Li, I think
there's a misunderstanding.

00:11:47.488 --> 00:11:49.100
The charts from the nursing homes
just now

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:50.220
came from

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:51.740
several visits we made

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:52.711
over the past few days.

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:54.140
They're from real field research.

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:56.100
With such limited

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:57.340
data scenarios,

00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.220
can the product's full applicability

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:00.500
really be shown?

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:01.500
Don't worry.

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:02.910
As long as we have enough time,

00:12:02.911 --> 00:12:04.911
we definitely won't limit
the data demonstration

00:12:04.911 --> 00:12:06.355
to nursing homes alone.

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:07.940
We'll add more scenarios later.

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:10.660
Alright. Thank you for putting
this proposal together

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:11.540
in such a short time.

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:13.340
Overall, we're quite satisfied.

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:15.060
But if you can refine it

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:16.260
a bit more afterward,

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:17.260
it'll be better.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:19.100
Computing power

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:20.860
is the core of our system.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:22.340
Can we highlight that more?

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:25.060
Computing power

00:12:25.088 --> 00:12:26.444
is hard to use as a selling point.

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:27.700
It's unfamiliar

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:29.540
to most users.

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:32.820
Advertising needs
to grab instant attention.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.460
But the core of our system is...

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:35.300
Alright.

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:36.460
Let's proceed with it.

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:37.980
Looking forward to
the next proposal.

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:38.860
Thank you.

00:12:39.422 --> 00:12:41.060
We'll get it done as soon as possible.

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:42.300
Sure.

What's going on?

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:34.460
When did he come back?

00:14:34.933 --> 00:14:36.733
How did he end up being your client?

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.500
He's a partner at the client's company.

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:41.380
A partner? What company?

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:42.500

Stop it.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:54.300
I don't have time for this.

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:56.140
You see,

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:58.311
he came looking for you
for a collaboration.

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:00.620
Is that a coincidence or a coincidence?

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:02.580
I don't know.

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:03.660
And I don't want to know.

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:05.940
I just want to get this done.

00:15:06.888 --> 00:15:08.260
Fine. Finish your work first.

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:09.780
When you're free,

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:10.620

Mr. Li.

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.420
A meeting at nine in the morning?

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:50.940
That's too much. Can everyone get up?

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:53.060
I'm going to Brother Yiyang's lab
at eleven.

00:15:53.111 --> 00:15:54.660
And you have a meeting this afternoon.

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:55.866
We're only free in the morning.

00:15:55.888 --> 00:15:57.200
Weren't you the one rushing us?

00:15:57.466 --> 00:15:58.644
Who are you calling "brother"?

00:15:58.860 --> 00:15:59.780
Taking advantage, huh?

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:04.540
You're heartless. I can't be.

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:06.060
I don't want Ms. Cen Jin

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:06.900
to think badly of me.

00:16:07.844 --> 00:16:08.900
Everyone must be tired.

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:09.860
Let's get coffee.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:12.060
Up to you.

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:16.100
What should I order?

00:16:16.711 --> 00:16:17.700
Everything on the menu?

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:20.100
Get a few Americanos.

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:25.660
Good morning.

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:27.300
Good morning, Ms. Cen Jin.

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:30.060
I'm sorry

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:31.266
to make you come so early.

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:32.820
We had no other choice.

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:34.460
Our afternoon schedule is packed.

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:36.940
It's fine. That's normal.

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:41.820
Mr. Cheng.

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:42.420
Thanks.

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:43.488
The coffee you ordered.

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:44.660
Great. Thanks.

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:46.380
Have some coffee first.

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:47.220
Okay.

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:51.780
You've all worked hard.

00:16:52.288 --> 00:16:53.380
The coffee is on Mr. Li.

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:56.700
I'm good, thanks.

00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:58.300
Jin, this one is hot.

00:16:58.620 --> 00:16:59.460
Thank you.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:04.100
Mr. Cheng.

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:05.540
Thank you.

00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:19.460
Let's begin.

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:20.900
Sure.

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:24.460
Based on

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.020
the revised direction from last time,

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:27.300
I'll briefly introduce

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:28.380
the three keywords

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:29.300
of our latest version.

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:31.820
They are

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:32.900
Smart and efficient.

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:34.700
Adoption of the newest technology

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.060
to reach management goals quickly.

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:39.340
Multi-Scenario.

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:41.540
The Cloud system applies

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:43.100
not only to industrial parks

00:17:43.133 --> 00:17:44.500
but can also open up commercial

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:46.380
and everyday environment areas.

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:05.260
That's all for my presentation.

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:06.940
Any comments?

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:08.180
Very good.

00:18:08.222 --> 00:18:10.111
I don't have problems with the proposal.

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:11.260
Please sit.

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:14.460
To be honest,

00:18:14.688 --> 00:18:16.100
we were on a tight schedule.

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:17.580
I had some worries,

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:19.180
but this turned out very thorough.

00:18:19.688 --> 00:18:21.577
Not only did you
solve the earlier issues,

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:22.820
but you also laid out

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:23.900
each follow-up step clearly.

00:18:23.911 --> 00:18:24.940
Actually, I still have...

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:25.900
The proposal's approved.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.420
We'll make other amendments

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:29.580
as we go.

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:31.340
Okay.

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:33.580
What's the next session

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:35.300
to start with?

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:37.060
Can we confirm

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:38.020
the contract details?

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:39.380
Yes.

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:39.980
We can confirm

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:41.022
the contract details now.

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:42.020
Sure.

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:44.580
Sorry to interrupt the meeting.

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:47.780
I've got something urgent.

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:52.380
This is

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:53.780
our other partner, Yi.

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:56.300
Hello.

00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:59.140
We can discuss

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:00.460
the contract later.

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:02.740
Sure.

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:10.260
Lu Tong,

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:11.180
you can head back.

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:12.900
Jin, are you worried?

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:14.500
It felt like the guy who came in earlier

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:15.577
interrupted us on purpose.

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:17.900
If the contract isn't signed,

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:19.300
things could change.

00:19:20.644 --> 00:19:22.111
I'm going back to double-check.

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:23.020
You head back first.

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:23.540
Alright.

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:24.460
Don't stay late.

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:25.740
Bye-bye, Jin.

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:33.180
Can two of you explain this to me?

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:34.660
The application we have

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:35.100
Please wait a moment.

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:36.380
Is enough for the market demand.

00:19:36.555 --> 00:19:38.300
Why do we have to spend money
on upgrades

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:39.620
and marketing?

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:42.340
Technology isn't just talk

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:43.020
or an idea.

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:44.380
We need funds.

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:46.220
Li Wu, what's gotten into you?

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:48.311
You just got back, and you're
already stirring things up.

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:49.540
Can't we focus on

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:50.909
keeping what we have running first?

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:53.155
Let's think about growing the business
before anything else.

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:54.420
I know you have ideals.

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:55.500
We all do.

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.220
But ideals
aren't our priority right now.

00:19:58.060 --> 00:19:59.060
I didn't come up with this

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:00.000
right after I came back.

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:01.444
I've had this plan for a long time.

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:02.700
Our current system

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:04.180
has a lot of room to improve.

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:05.340
Once we upgrade it,

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:06.866
we can secure a much bigger market.

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:09.700
Who says new and advanced things
are what the market wants?

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:11.740
Ms. Cen, I'm sorry.

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:13.911
Mr. Li and Mr. Cheng
are still in a meeting.

00:20:13.911 --> 00:20:15.020
Maybe you can wait

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:15.860
in Mr. Li's office.

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.700
Even though the cost goes up,

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:17.580
Okay.

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:19.200
- the demand will rise too.
- Please come with me.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.380
And our potential client base

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:21.220
will grow as well.

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:22.660
Technology and business

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:23.820
go hand in hand.

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:25.900
He has a point, Yi.

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:28.020
Li Wu is only

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:29.420
trying to expand...

00:20:33.577 --> 00:20:34.540
Please wait a moment.

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:35.380
Sure. Thank you.

Is this from

00:21:54.911 --> 00:21:57.066
when you and your partners
first started the company?

00:21:58.780 --> 00:21:59.620
Yes.

00:22:03.355 --> 00:22:04.420
It's only been a few years,

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:05.620
and you've achieved so much.

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:07.140
You're impressive.

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:18.180
What's the matter?

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:24.220
We've been doing our best

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:25.420
to support

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:26.740
Tongchen's idea,

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:28.620
but the contract isn't moving forward.

00:22:30.133 --> 00:22:32.155
- Is there any chance...
- That's what you came here for?

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:38.380
We've put a lot of resources
into this project.

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:40.780
Naturally, we hope for a fair return.

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.180
Putting in effort doesn't mean

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:45.220
you get something back.

00:22:46.222 --> 00:22:47.777
Isn't that how a lot of things work?

00:22:57.660 --> 00:22:58.500
Li Wu,

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:00.420
do you not want to work with me?

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:02.820
Sorry?

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:06.500
I feel like

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:07.911
you're holding something against me.

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:10.700
If the project isn't moving forward
because of me,

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:12.100
I can step out.

00:23:16.577 --> 00:23:17.900
You're making a meal of this.

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:23.940
Good then.

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:25.688
I won't bother you further.

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:27.620
Hope we can work smoothly from here on.

00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:51.620
Jin,

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:52.460
you're back.

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:09.580
What's wrong?

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:16.540
You look terrible.

00:24:17.066 --> 00:24:18.100
I can't push it through.

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:21.860
What's the first rule

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:22.740
in our company?

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:25.060
Always look on the bright side.

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:26.020
Did you forget?

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:30.900
There's no bright side for me
in this project.

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:32.780
What's that supposed to mean?

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:39.260
How about this?

00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:41.060
My case

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:41.940
just wrapped up.

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:44.380
I'll take over this project,

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:45.422
and you'll support me?

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:46.300
Alright.

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:47.660
That's settled then.

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:48.620
No matter what,

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:51.740
we can't let all our effort
go to waste, okay?

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:54.660
Ladies,

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:56.460
Tongchen's contract is here.

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:57.780
If the legal team approves it,

00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:58.822
we can sign the contract.

00:24:58.900 --> 00:24:59.740
Really?

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:02.940
What did I just say?

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:05.020
Always look on the bright side.

00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:07.220
You're always worrying over nothing.

00:25:09.644 --> 00:25:11.020
Alright. Get back to work.

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:11.860
Okay.

00:25:23.822 --> 00:25:25.020
You can have your assistant

00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:25.980
look through it again.

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:27.380
If there's any issue,

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:28.260
let me know.

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:29.100
Sure.

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:30.380
I looked it over.

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:31.220
It's all right.

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:32.540
Thank you so much.

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:34.180
It's what I'm supposed to do.

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:39.500
Why are you here?

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:41.380
Mr. Li,

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:44.340
weren't you testing the system?

00:25:46.511 --> 00:25:47.540
You weren't here earlier.

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:49.700
Ms. Shen will be fully in charge
from here on.

00:25:51.177 --> 00:25:52.777
I'm looking forward
to our collaboration.

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:55.220
Yes.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.600
I'm looking forward
to our collaboration.

00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:58.500
Me too.

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:19.900
You're going upstairs alone?

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:23.577
Drive safely on your way back.

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:25.540
Okay. I'm off.

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:27.700
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

00:26:50.711 --> 00:26:52.044
What are you doing here?

00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:57.980
I can't come?

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:02.260
You left the project.

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:07.140
You really don't want to see me?

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:09.940
Did you drink?

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:11.340
So what?

00:27:13.622 --> 00:27:15.444
Do I need your permission for that?

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:19.940
It's late.

00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:20.780
You should go home.

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:22.340
We can talk

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:24.100
when you sober up.

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:37.500
You're still the same

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:40.620
after so many years.

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:46.660
You decide everything on your own.

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:48.780
Never give anyone a chance.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:54.488
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

00:27:54.866 --> 00:27:56.580
Who said she'd be responsible

00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:57.622
for Tongchen's project?

00:27:59.180 --> 00:27:59.900
We only switch

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:00.980
the person in charge.

00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:03.420
It doesn't affect the progress.

00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:04.460
Did you ever ask me?

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:11.020
I'm the project leader.

00:28:11.355 --> 00:28:12.620
Did it even cross your mind

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:14.020
to check with me?

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:19.260
Or am I just that insignificant?

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:25.860
Just why?

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:30.820
Every time, the one who decides

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:33.180
whether to leave or stay

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:34.980

Bring those

with high scores.

about your math,

what will you say?

Average.

00:33:12.622 --> 00:33:14.180
You need to sound more confident

00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:16.380
when talking to a teacher.

00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:18.940
What should I say?

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:22.140
I went through your papers.

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:23.460
Your math is pretty good.

00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:25.180
I think it's your best subject.

00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:28.420
My best is physics.

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:30.260
See? That sounds confident.

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:37.100
The admission teacher

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:38.100
is a math teacher.

00:33:38.177 --> 00:33:39.940
He's trained
a lot of Olympiad champions.

00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:46.580
Li Wu,

00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:48.140
have you lied before?

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:53.100
"Math is my favorite subject."

00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:55.380
Would you

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:56.600
say something like this?

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:00.380
My favorite is physics.

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:03.460
Alright.

00:34:14.222 --> 00:34:15.700
I'm going to Shanghai next week

00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:16.540
for training.

00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:18.220
Mr. Qi, I'm heading to class.

00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:19.420
Okay. Go ahead.

00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:24.300
Excuse me.

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:25.260
Sorry to bother you.

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:26.260
I'm here to look for...

00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:28.220
You're Cen's daughter, right?

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:29.580
Come on in.

00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:30.420
Come in.

00:34:31.044 --> 00:34:32.340
Did you bring the student?

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:34.100
Yes, Mr. Qi.

00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:35.380
Is it him?

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:37.420
You're Li Wu?

00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:39.100
Hello, Mr. Qi.

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:39.940
Hello.

00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:41.220
Good.

00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:42.660
Tall boy.

00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:43.660
Looks neat.

00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:47.460
You've looked around

00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:48.580
the school just now,

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:49.420
didn't you?

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:51.300
How is it?

00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:52.940
Do you want to study here?

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:54.820
Yes.

00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:56.940
Mr. Qi,

00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:57.980
my dad told me

00:34:57.980 --> 00:34:58.940
your classes

00:34:58.940 --> 00:34:59.933
were always the top

00:34:59.955 --> 00:35:01.820
back when you taught
at Yi City High School,

00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:03.244
and also now at Yingcai High School.

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:04.955
If he could study under you,

00:35:04.977 --> 00:35:06.740
he'd definitely make great progress.

00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:09.580
Your dad exaggerates.

00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:12.300
He told me about the boy's situation.

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:13.700
With his grades,

00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:15.780
getting in is no problem.

00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:17.580
The repeat-year program

00:35:17.622 --> 00:35:18.580
in Yingcai High School

00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:20.220
ranks first in the city.

00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:22.088
We place students into classes

00:35:22.088 --> 00:35:24.340
based on their NCEE results
[*National College Entrance Examination]

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:26.820
There's a Rocket Class
and a Talent Class.

00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:27.860
Of course,

00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:28.900
the better classes

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:30.740
tend to have

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:31.866
a stronger study atmosphere.

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:33.340
The problem is

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:34.822
that he doesn't have NCEE results.

00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:37.660
Are there other students

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:38.940
in a similar situation?

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:40.940
There are,

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:42.100
but not many.

00:35:43.688 --> 00:35:44.700
Here's what we'll do.

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:46.060
On Monday,

00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:48.020
take him to complete the admission

00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:49.260
and dormitory procedures first.

00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:52.460
Then the school

00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:54.260
will arrange a placement test

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:55.620
for students like him.

00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:57.380
We'll assign him to a class

00:35:57.540 --> 00:35:58.380
based on the results.

00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:00.260
Alright.

00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:02.380
Li Wu,

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:04.860
I heard you missed a lot

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:05.955
because you were working.

00:36:06.644 --> 00:36:08.133
Will you be able to keep up?

00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:10.060
I'll do my best.

00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:11.300
Good.

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:12.140
Work hard.

00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:13.980
By the way,

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:15.780
how's your math?

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:20.180
Just

00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:21.460
average.

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:28.580
But I really like math.

00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:29.980
I'll work hard.

00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:31.420
Good.

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:32.660
I have confidence in you.

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:34.660
Thank you, Mr. Qi.

00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:37.860
Didn't you say

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:39.377
physics is the only subject you like?

00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:42.140
Math

00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:44.740
is a method and tool

00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:46.060
for studying physics.

00:36:46.955 --> 00:36:48.420
Then why were you arguing with me

00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:49.820
and didn't tell me?

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:53.580
I'm... I'm sorry.

00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:55.420
Why are you apologizing?

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:56.220
Well,

00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:57.700
I was joking with you.

00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:04.100
Anyway, you've finally

00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:05.060
come back to school.

00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:07.180
Focus on studying.

00:37:08.733 --> 00:37:10.780
If math is average,
then put in more effort.

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:13.020
I will.

00:37:14.688 --> 00:37:16.420
You're reporting to school
in a few days.

00:37:16.511 --> 00:37:17.729
You didn't bring much luggage.

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:19.044
I'll take you to buy more clothes

00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:20.100
to get you started.

00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:23.140
I have clothes.

00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:25.980
You saw it at school just now.

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:27.180
Uniforms aren't the only thing

00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:28.140
students wear.

00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:29.820
I don't want your clothes

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:30.700
to draw

00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:32.140
unnecessary attention or comments.

00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:36.860
Just think of it
as a welcome gift from me.

00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:48.740
Too loud.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.660
Hello. Do you have any preferred styles?

00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:53.733
I can recommend something.

00:37:53.911 --> 00:37:54.500
It's fine.

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:56.140
We'll look around ourselves. Thank you.

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:09.260
This looks nice too.

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:10.260
Basic style.

00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:13.180
Try this on.

00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:16.300
A minute.

00:38:17.622 --> 00:38:19.177
Could you help him try this on?

00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:20.980
Thanks.

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:21.820
This way, please.

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:25.580
Hello?

00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:27.140
Where are you?

00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:29.140
My mom finally left.

00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:30.620
I'm at the mall.

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:32.820
Do you remember I told you

00:38:32.911 --> 00:38:34.280
about the boy who's starting school?

00:38:34.288 --> 00:38:35.700
I'm helping him buy a few clothes.

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:40.620
(499 yuan)

00:38:46.155 --> 00:38:47.580
Are your parents still mad at you?

00:38:48.733 --> 00:38:50.020
What's the point of being mad?

00:38:50.155 --> 00:38:51.866
I'm the one
who should feel hurt about it.

00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:53.660
Don't feel that way.

00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:55.540
I'll treat you later

00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:56.380
to cheer you up.

00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:57.540
Bring the boy along.

00:38:58.580 --> 00:38:59.420
Sure.

00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:00.820
See you later.

00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:07.900
He's done, Miss.

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:12.740
Nice.

00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:16.020
There's one more.

00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:19.220
I tried that one.

00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:20.620
It didn't fit.

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:23.100
Try the one I picked.

00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:25.220
Here.

00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:30.620
(799 yuan)

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:31.740
Go on.

00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:42.620
Turn around.

00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:43.460
Look in the mirror.

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:46.220
Miss, you really know how to style.

00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:47.700
He looks trendy.

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:49.260
Do you like it?

00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:54.020
I think it looks great.

00:39:56.244 --> 00:39:57.420
Let's get a pair of shoes too.

00:39:57.780 --> 00:39:58.620
This way, please.

00:40:03.822 --> 00:40:04.940
What size do you wear?

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:07.100
I...

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:08.620
Size 44.

00:40:08.755 --> 00:40:10.355
Could you get a pair in size 44?

00:40:10.377 --> 00:40:12.260
We're out of stock.

00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:13.500
But this style runs wide.

00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:14.740
You can try

00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:15.620
the 43 first.

00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:16.620
If it doesn't fit,

00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:17.844
I'll order a pair for you.

00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:19.820
How about you try them on?

00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:28.700
Thank you.

00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:36.780
Walk around. Are they small?

00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:51.780
Looks like they're not quite right.

00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:53.380
I'll take the 44.

00:40:53.711 --> 00:40:55.260
Send them to me when they arrive.

00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:56.220
Sure.

00:40:57.500 --> 00:40:58.660
Keep the shirt for now.

00:40:58.780 --> 00:40:59.540
Let's check out.

00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:00.622
Okay. This way, please.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.500
Everything's served. Enjoy your meal.

00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:23.100
Thank you.

00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:23.940
You're welcome.

00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:39.300
Jin!

00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:41.020
What?

00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:42.300
How are you?

00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:43.420
I was so worried about you.

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:45.220
It's only been a few days.

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:46.340
Are you really fine?

00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:47.060
I'm fine.

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:47.900
Good. Sit.

00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:51.820
Is this the boy?

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:53.380
He's good-looking.

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:54.260
Hello.

00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:54.900
I'm Chun Chang.

00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:56.020
You can call me Chun Chang.

00:41:57.500 --> 00:41:58.340
Li Wu.

00:41:58.500 --> 00:41:59.340
Chun Chang.

00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:00.620
You're handsome.

00:42:06.044 --> 00:42:07.700
How've you been these two days?

00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:09.580
Couldn't eat or sleep, right?

00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:11.420
No.

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:13.820
Really?

00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:17.500
Okay then.

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:19.500
Eat more.

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:20.700
Get chubbier.

00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:22.140
And good immunity.

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:23.380
True.

00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:30.780
Why aren't you eating, Li Wu?

00:42:35.777 --> 00:42:38.111
These just came out fresh.
They're really good.

00:42:40.533 --> 00:42:42.140
- You should eat more.
- Thank you.

00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:43.940
Alright.

00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:52.380
Oh right.

00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:54.500
I have a really good lawyer friend.

00:42:54.511 --> 00:42:56.111
Do you want me to recommend him to you?

00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:56.860
No need.

00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:59.660
I can handle things as they are.

00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:00.860
Really?

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:05.740
What about you?

00:43:05.755 --> 00:43:07.488
What did your mom come for this time?

00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:09.580
What else could it be?

00:43:09.866 --> 00:43:11.044
To set me up with someone.

00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:12.700
Again?

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:15.140
I'm scared of getting married.

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:17.660
You're my warning example.

00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:21.300
You use me as your excuse, huh?

00:43:27.955 --> 00:43:29.020
Eating with a young man

00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:30.260
is really a feast for the eyes.

00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:34.460
He's a kid. Don't tease him.

00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:35.940
What kid?

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:36.900
He's already an adult.

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:39.940
You're cute.

00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:41.820
You blush right away when I make a joke.

00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:48.940
Li Wu,

00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:49.980
why is your face so red?

00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:51.220
What's wrong?

00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:53.260
Are you

00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:54.340
feeling unwell?

00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:57.220
I think so.

00:43:57.511 --> 00:43:58.900
Let's get you to the hospital.

00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:00.540
Get up.

00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:01.620
Bill, please.

00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:03.540
Lean on me.

00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:04.660
Careful.
