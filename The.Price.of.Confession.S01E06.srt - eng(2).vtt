00:00:46.734 --> 00:00:47.777
Are you sure…

00:00:50.405 --> 00:00:51.906
I can say it here?

00:01:12.927 --> 00:01:14.512
"My life

00:01:16.014 --> 00:01:17.640
is over now."

00:01:19.934 --> 00:01:21.769
"So let's not get any funny ideas

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.397
and face the end with humility."

00:01:25.523 --> 00:01:27.942
I was beating myself up with those words.

00:01:37.994 --> 00:01:38.953
Ms. An, are you okay?

00:01:41.206 --> 00:01:42.040
Ms. An.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.184
Be careful.

00:02:02.477 --> 00:02:04.354
-What is it?
-What's going on?

00:02:05.146 --> 00:02:07.815
Coming through!

00:02:08.483 --> 00:02:09.567
Coming through!

00:02:14.447 --> 00:02:17.700
Were you hinting at suicide earlier?
Why did you say that?

00:02:17.784 --> 00:02:21.079
You've shown no remorse until now.
Are you finally sorry?

00:02:21.162 --> 00:02:23.039
-A comment, please!
-A few words, please!

00:02:23.122 --> 00:02:23.998
-Are you…
-Why…

00:02:26.292 --> 00:02:27.460
Where did that come from?

00:02:31.756 --> 00:02:34.092
Let me say just one thing to her.

00:02:35.301 --> 00:02:37.220
I really hope you keep your word

00:02:37.971 --> 00:02:39.597
about what you said in court.

00:02:40.682 --> 00:02:41.891
You'd better

00:02:43.351 --> 00:02:44.644
keep it.

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:48.231
Don't worry,

00:02:49.983 --> 00:02:51.234
Se-hun's grandfather.

JINKANG HIGH SCHOOL

00:05:23.928 --> 00:05:25.179
Hang on. Let me reload.

00:05:25.721 --> 00:05:26.597
Okay.

00:05:26.681 --> 00:05:28.641
Damn, they keep coming.

00:05:29.142 --> 00:05:30.351
How much HP do you have?

00:05:30.977 --> 00:05:32.687
I think I need the ammo pack.

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.356
Where are the sentries?
Why did you deploy them there?

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.441
Jeez, man!

00:05:37.066 --> 00:05:40.069
No, I'll go downstairs.
You cover upstairs.

00:05:40.153 --> 00:05:42.488
Watch out. Behind you. I said watch out!

00:05:43.739 --> 00:05:46.367
Why the hell did you deploy
the sentries there?

00:05:46.451 --> 00:05:47.827
Get the one throwing first.

00:05:48.327 --> 00:05:49.579
They're coming all at once.

00:05:50.079 --> 00:05:51.747
Back me up. They're coming!

00:05:51.831 --> 00:05:54.709
No, wait! For fuck's sake!

00:05:57.128 --> 00:05:58.296
Hurry up and revive me.

00:05:59.338 --> 00:06:00.840
Just fucking revive me!

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.227
Fucking hell.

00:07:02.818 --> 00:07:04.195
-See you.
-Bye.

00:08:21.188 --> 00:08:25.401
I'm only showing you this,
Mr. Jin, because it's you.

00:08:25.484 --> 00:08:27.028
But what will you do with it?

00:08:27.111 --> 00:08:27.945
Sir.

00:08:28.821 --> 00:08:31.949
-Weren't there two broken wine bottles?
-Yes.

00:08:32.033 --> 00:08:34.452
What if the bottle
Ms. An's fingerprints are on

00:08:34.535 --> 00:08:36.996
was not the bottle used for the murder?

00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:39.665
UNDETECTED
DETECTED

00:08:39.749 --> 00:08:42.627
Did you check if the victim's blood
and her prints were on the same bottle?

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:43.544
No.

00:08:44.462 --> 00:08:45.588
Why not?

00:08:45.671 --> 00:08:47.548
The prosecution never requested it.

00:08:47.632 --> 00:08:49.258
What if we request it?

00:08:49.342 --> 00:08:51.927
Didn't the killer confess?
So why are you coming to me--

00:08:52.011 --> 00:08:53.512
The thing is, the killer…

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.308
is a bit emotionally unstable.

00:08:57.391 --> 00:08:59.644
I need hard evidence
that my client didn't do it.

00:08:59.727 --> 00:09:02.438
Then I suggest you make a formal request.

00:09:02.521 --> 00:09:04.732
The prosecution will deny it anyway.

00:09:04.815 --> 00:09:06.817
Well, I guess that's that, then.

00:09:06.901 --> 00:09:07.818
Huh?

00:09:07.902 --> 00:09:09.070
Listen, Mr. Jin.

00:09:10.363 --> 00:09:13.032
Let's have dinner together tonight.
It's on me.

00:09:14.075 --> 00:09:17.161
Given the circumstances,
the court granted leniency.

00:09:18.245 --> 00:09:19.080
Thank you.

00:09:19.872 --> 00:09:23.584
-There's no need to thank me.
-Thanks.

00:09:24.251 --> 00:09:26.545
But they added a condition.

00:09:26.629 --> 00:09:29.090
"There will be no further leniency."

00:09:29.173 --> 00:09:32.093
"If you break the law one more time,

00:09:32.176 --> 00:09:33.928
your bail will be revoked."

00:09:34.011 --> 00:09:36.806
"No exceptions, under any circumstances."

00:09:38.557 --> 00:09:40.559
Now, here.

00:09:40.643 --> 00:09:42.061
LOCATION TRACKING
(AN YUN-SU GPS LOG)

00:09:42.144 --> 00:09:43.270
Do you know what this is?

00:09:44.772 --> 00:09:45.606
No.

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:47.066
It's your GPS log.

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:49.819
Your location

00:09:49.902 --> 00:09:52.905
is recorded every hour, every day.

00:09:53.489 --> 00:09:56.367
If something happens at the same time
and place as you,

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:59.787
you'll be the first person
to be suspected.

00:10:05.626 --> 00:10:10.673
So you cannot get involved in any trouble.

00:10:11.173 --> 00:10:15.428
Even if something happens in front of you,
just ignore it and walk away.

00:10:15.511 --> 00:10:17.263
If it's something you can't avoid,

00:10:17.763 --> 00:10:20.224
call the control center right away.

00:10:20.307 --> 00:10:24.353
If you do that, you can at least
avoid the worst-case scenario.

00:10:25.229 --> 00:10:28.107
Okay, then. Shall we start the session?

00:10:29.859 --> 00:10:31.861
How have you been lately?

00:10:32.486 --> 00:10:36.741
You seem to have been keeping very busy,
aside from sending Sop to kindergarten.

00:10:39.535 --> 00:10:41.495
Would it be okay if I didn't talk today?

00:10:42.705 --> 00:10:44.665
I don't really have much to say.

00:10:46.959 --> 00:10:51.130
Would you be okay
with me reporting to the court as is?

00:10:52.548 --> 00:10:53.382
Yes.

00:10:57.178 --> 00:11:00.055
You'll still have to stay here
until five o'clock.

00:11:12.234 --> 00:11:13.652
Shall we listen to the radio?

00:11:14.904 --> 00:11:16.155
So it's not awkward.

00:11:16.655 --> 00:11:20.910
Many stories have made their way
to the Your Afternoon message board.

00:11:20.993 --> 00:11:22.244
I will share a few…

00:11:23.245 --> 00:11:25.039
-I think it goes here.
-Yes.

00:11:27.166 --> 00:11:28.000
Done.

00:11:33.297 --> 00:11:35.299
So this was "just an introduction"?

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.260
I truly respect and appreciate you
for doing this.

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.766
Right. I respect you too, Mr. Jang.

00:11:44.683 --> 00:11:45.684
That's a bit random.

00:11:46.268 --> 00:11:47.812
You've got grit.

00:11:49.188 --> 00:11:50.147
I appreciate it.

00:11:51.857 --> 00:11:54.485
By the way,
how was Ms. An at the trial the other day?

00:11:54.568 --> 00:11:55.694
Did she say anything?

00:11:55.778 --> 00:11:56.737
Like what?

00:11:56.821 --> 00:12:00.241
Mo Eun hinted at suicide,
saying she didn't have much time.

00:12:02.368 --> 00:12:04.370
She seemed very anxious.

00:12:05.412 --> 00:12:08.040
So much so that she was
completely out of it in court.

00:12:10.459 --> 00:12:12.920
What does she think of Mo Eun?

00:12:13.921 --> 00:12:14.964
What do you mean?

00:12:15.047 --> 00:12:19.844
She's someone who killed her husband
but also cleared her name.

00:12:21.178 --> 00:12:22.263
It's hard to say.

00:12:22.805 --> 00:12:25.015
I'm not really sure how she feels.

00:12:25.599 --> 00:12:27.017
But like I said before,

00:12:27.518 --> 00:12:30.813
she was always anxious
when we talked about Mo Eun.

00:12:42.324 --> 00:12:44.368
Time drags, doesn't it?

00:12:49.039 --> 00:12:49.874
Gosh.

00:12:51.458 --> 00:12:53.544
Maybe my baby is into old music.

00:12:54.503 --> 00:12:56.463
Ta-da's kicking.

00:12:58.382 --> 00:13:00.759
Oh, that's my baby's nickname.

00:13:02.428 --> 00:13:05.514
It showed up late in our lives,
like "ta-da"!

00:13:08.976 --> 00:13:10.227
Time's up.

00:13:12.104 --> 00:13:14.732
-Next time, let's have tteokbokki--
-See you next time.

00:13:15.691 --> 00:13:17.359
Get home safe.

00:13:20.821 --> 00:13:22.406
Man, this is tough.

00:15:48.761 --> 00:15:50.679
Did you forget something?

00:15:50.763 --> 00:15:52.848
No, I felt like
I was a bit rude earlier, so…

00:15:54.975 --> 00:15:57.102
Tteokbokki?

00:15:57.186 --> 00:15:58.228
Yeah.

00:16:01.774 --> 00:16:03.525
-You'll have some too, right?
-Yes.

00:16:08.155 --> 00:16:11.075
I didn't know you'd be this happy,
and I just left like that.

00:16:11.158 --> 00:16:14.244
No, not at all. Don't say that.

00:16:14.912 --> 00:16:16.455
This looks so good.

00:16:17.122 --> 00:16:18.040
Oh my God!

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:19.541
Oh no.

00:16:20.125 --> 00:16:22.169
-I'm so sorry.
-I'll quickly wash it.

00:16:22.252 --> 00:16:24.088
-It'll be fine.
-Are there any tissues?

00:16:24.171 --> 00:16:26.548
-I'll be right back.
-I'm sorry.

00:16:26.632 --> 00:16:27.841
No worries.

Well, this should…

I was just looking for some wet wipes.

see this?

just ask.

Damn, she's quick.

00:19:37.322 --> 00:19:38.573
Fucking hell.

00:19:39.074 --> 00:19:41.410
Ms. Eom told me to stay glued to you.

00:19:41.493 --> 00:19:43.328
Fuck. It's not like I want to, okay?

00:19:50.002 --> 00:19:51.503
Let's take a break.

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:07.144
What was that?

00:20:09.354 --> 00:20:10.981
So you said you'd kill yourself?

00:20:11.982 --> 00:20:13.734
In goddamn court, no less.

00:20:13.817 --> 00:20:17.362
Why the hell would you say something
like that in court? For fuck's sake.

00:20:18.947 --> 00:20:22.951
And fucking Eom is overreacting right now,
making me follow you.

00:20:23.035 --> 00:20:25.037
I'm yet to fucking see with my own eyes

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.539
a bitch who said she'd kill herself
actually fucking do it.

00:20:27.622 --> 00:20:29.207
Lying bitches.

00:20:34.463 --> 00:20:36.965
But you, hon?

00:20:37.049 --> 00:20:38.592
You might actually do it.

00:20:39.718 --> 00:20:41.553
But make sure you do it on your own.

00:20:41.636 --> 00:20:44.723
Don't drag anyone innocent down with you.
Promise me.

00:20:47.017 --> 00:20:48.310
I'll try.

00:20:50.354 --> 00:20:52.356
Shit, don't look at me like that.

00:20:52.439 --> 00:20:55.525
It's goddamn creepy, hon.
You're scary as hell.

00:20:55.609 --> 00:20:57.361
Where the hell are you going?

00:20:57.444 --> 00:20:58.362
To the toilet.

00:21:05.327 --> 00:21:08.497
Do I have to follow her
to the fucking bathroom too?

00:21:19.383 --> 00:21:21.134
You're going to come in too?

00:21:22.135 --> 00:21:23.762
I don't want to either,

00:21:23.845 --> 00:21:25.806
but you're under
special supervision orders.

00:21:32.521 --> 00:21:34.147
Aren't you scared to…

00:21:36.191 --> 00:21:37.401
be alone with me?

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:39.903
I'm not even cuffed.

00:21:42.572 --> 00:21:44.658
I'm not going to kill myself yet,

00:21:45.158 --> 00:21:46.785
so just wait here and chill.

00:21:52.582 --> 00:21:55.043
You fucking bitch! You're dead meat!

00:21:56.545 --> 00:21:58.672
Come here, you fucking bitch!

00:22:02.551 --> 00:22:03.677
Fucking hell!

00:22:06.221 --> 00:22:07.639
Fuck you!

00:22:07.722 --> 00:22:08.890
Go fuck yourself!

00:22:12.018 --> 00:22:13.520
-Move!
-Break it up!

00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:21.653
All officers to the auditorium!

00:22:22.487 --> 00:22:24.072
All officers to the auditorium!

00:22:43.175 --> 00:22:44.384
You bitch!

00:22:46.511 --> 00:22:47.512
Shut up!

00:22:50.974 --> 00:22:52.142
Hey, you little shit.

00:22:55.479 --> 00:22:57.147
Hey, be quiet!

00:23:16.791 --> 00:23:17.626
Hey.

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:21.046
So getting out tomorrow means
I don't exist now?

00:23:23.006 --> 00:23:26.635
You want to be drinking through a straw,

00:23:26.718 --> 00:23:29.387
clutching your chin, do you?

00:23:31.264 --> 00:23:33.767
You little shit.

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:36.186
Damn, look at this bitch.

00:23:37.395 --> 00:23:38.647
You bitch!

00:23:52.452 --> 00:23:53.662
Where's Inmate 407?

00:23:54.871 --> 00:23:55.914
In the toilet.

00:23:55.997 --> 00:23:57.582
Where's Inmate 407?

00:23:57.666 --> 00:23:59.584
I fucking told you she went to the toilet!

00:23:59.668 --> 00:24:01.753
Are you fucking deaf? Fucking hell.

00:24:01.836 --> 00:24:03.880
I'm not following someone to the toilet…

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:12.847
For fuck's sake.

00:24:14.224 --> 00:24:15.809
Look at this little shit.

00:24:16.309 --> 00:24:19.062
Trying to be clever now, are we?

00:24:19.145 --> 00:24:20.105
Huh?

00:24:21.273 --> 00:24:22.274
Damn.

00:24:22.941 --> 00:24:24.192
Get up.

00:24:24.818 --> 00:24:26.111
I said get up!

00:24:26.987 --> 00:24:28.238
Damn it.

00:24:29.864 --> 00:24:31.157
Hey, you fucker!

00:24:33.743 --> 00:24:36.371
Hey, I think this is for real.

00:24:36.454 --> 00:24:38.039
Man, what's up with her?

00:24:39.874 --> 00:24:40.709
Hey!

00:24:41.209 --> 00:24:42.544
Dumbass.

00:24:44.671 --> 00:24:45.839
-Dumbass.
-Shit.

00:24:46.423 --> 00:24:48.800
Hey! Get up!

00:24:50.093 --> 00:24:53.179
Fuck. Hey! Wake up!

00:25:00.395 --> 00:25:01.229
Wake up!

00:25:02.397 --> 00:25:03.273
Wake up!

00:25:03.773 --> 00:25:05.358
-Man, this is fucked.
-Hey.

00:25:05.442 --> 00:25:07.527
-Damn it.
-Wake up!

00:25:08.903 --> 00:25:09.904
Fucking hell.

00:25:09.988 --> 00:25:12.032
All I did was press on her neck.

00:25:13.366 --> 00:25:14.951
Wake up, goddamn it.

00:25:15.035 --> 00:25:16.286
-Hey!
-Shit.

00:25:16.786 --> 00:25:17.621
Wake up!

00:25:23.043 --> 00:25:25.378
What the hell are you doing?

00:25:25.462 --> 00:25:26.379
What the fuck!

00:25:26.463 --> 00:25:27.714
Let go, you fucking bitch!

00:25:31.384 --> 00:25:33.970
-Don't! You're going to kill her!
-Hey!

00:25:34.054 --> 00:25:35.096
-Shit!
-Inmate 407.

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:36.931
What the hell are you doing? Hey!

00:25:37.015 --> 00:25:38.350
-Inmate 407, stop.
-Stop it!

00:25:38.433 --> 00:25:40.894
Don't! Stop it!

00:26:19.015 --> 00:26:19.849
Excuse me!

00:26:20.475 --> 00:26:21.976
She's awake!

00:26:23.061 --> 00:26:24.896
Eun's awake!

00:26:27.107 --> 00:26:28.983
I told Ms. Eom everything.

00:26:29.067 --> 00:26:30.652
I told her you saved my life.

00:26:31.236 --> 00:26:33.405
The doctor said if it weren't for you,

00:26:33.488 --> 00:26:35.573
I really would have died.

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.369
Eun, thank you so much.

00:26:44.624 --> 00:26:46.626
Can you please get off me?

00:26:56.177 --> 00:26:58.012
I got the wrong idea.

00:26:59.055 --> 00:27:01.099
You were beating someone
lying on the floor.

00:27:01.182 --> 00:27:03.268
She absolutely made the right call.

00:27:05.854 --> 00:27:08.690
She has a very thick layer
of subcutaneous fat,

00:27:08.773 --> 00:27:11.735
so resuscitating her
with standard chest compressions is hard.

00:27:12.277 --> 00:27:13.319
Look straight ahead.

00:27:17.031 --> 00:27:18.658
Do you feel dizzy or uncomfortable?

00:27:19.159 --> 00:27:20.618
Well, can you…

00:27:22.871 --> 00:27:24.122
That's not really my call.

00:27:28.668 --> 00:27:29.502
No.

00:27:32.547 --> 00:27:34.674
Ms. Eom, HQ is calling for you.

00:27:35.425 --> 00:27:37.844
Can I take both of them back?

00:27:37.927 --> 00:27:39.179
You can take her.

00:27:39.262 --> 00:27:42.432
But she sustained a head injury,
so I'll keep her here a bit longer.

00:27:49.814 --> 00:27:51.941
Here, a painkiller and antiemetic.

00:28:00.158 --> 00:28:01.659
I'll just take this.

00:28:08.708 --> 00:28:11.544
By the way, what was your job
before coming here?

00:28:13.755 --> 00:28:17.050
Well, I heard about what you did earlier.

00:28:17.634 --> 00:28:20.386
You went right for chest compressions
without mouth-to-mouth.

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:23.139
It's in the latest guidelines
from the cardiology society.

00:28:23.223 --> 00:28:26.226
You also picked out
the painkiller just then.

00:28:27.435 --> 00:28:29.896
I feel like you were in this line of work.

00:28:30.396 --> 00:28:31.314
Were you a nurse?

00:28:32.315 --> 00:28:33.441
Or a med student?

00:28:35.902 --> 00:28:37.195
Don't you scare easily?

00:28:37.821 --> 00:28:38.655
Sorry?

00:28:38.738 --> 00:28:40.073
Do you always

00:28:41.825 --> 00:28:42.909
talk this much?

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:50.458
I used to get scared easily,
but I got over it after starting this job.

00:28:51.751 --> 00:28:53.044
And I've always been talkative.

00:30:02.697 --> 00:30:05.742
You found something the police missed.

00:30:06.993 --> 00:30:09.954
It looks like a woman's watch.

00:30:11.539 --> 00:30:12.999
Actually, Mo Eun has a watch.

00:30:14.292 --> 00:30:18.046
I remember thinking at her trial
that her watch didn't suit her.

00:30:18.546 --> 00:30:21.633
She must be very fond of it
to have worn it to trial.

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:24.802
I have a feeling…

00:30:27.013 --> 00:30:28.973
this could be a huge lead.

00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:38.942
Hello, Mr. Jang.

00:30:39.859 --> 00:30:42.111
Why? What favor do you need this time?

00:30:42.195 --> 00:30:43.821
My back still feels stiff.

00:30:46.032 --> 00:30:46.866
Yes.

00:30:49.869 --> 00:30:51.204
Are you sure about that?

00:30:52.538 --> 00:30:54.332
Ms. Eom must have felt bad.

00:30:54.415 --> 00:30:56.042
She even let me bring in coffee.

00:31:01.547 --> 00:31:03.383
Aren't you going to drink that?

00:31:05.259 --> 00:31:06.511
You can have it.

00:31:16.229 --> 00:31:17.313
What?

00:31:18.022 --> 00:31:19.023
Doesn't it suit me?

00:31:19.565 --> 00:31:20.400
Yes, it does.

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:23.486
Seems precious to you.

00:31:24.696 --> 00:31:25.530
It is.

00:31:27.031 --> 00:31:28.241
Before I got here,

00:31:28.741 --> 00:31:30.535
I was on a call with Ms. An's attorney.

00:31:30.618 --> 00:31:31.577
He asked

00:31:32.286 --> 00:31:34.080
if I could ask for your watch

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:35.957
and bring it to him.

00:31:38.584 --> 00:31:40.920
Blood stains were discovered
at the crime scene,

00:31:41.004 --> 00:31:43.423
and there was a mark left by a watch.

00:31:47.802 --> 00:31:50.346
They want to see if it's mine, don't they?

00:31:53.516 --> 00:31:54.809
Yun-su's been busy

00:31:56.227 --> 00:31:59.105
since she got out, hasn't she?

00:32:06.112 --> 00:32:08.281
Don't you need a warrant to take this?

00:32:08.364 --> 00:32:10.658
Yes, if you follow procedure.

00:32:10.742 --> 00:32:12.243
Would the prosecution issue one?

00:32:12.827 --> 00:32:14.287
That's why he called me.

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:16.456
He wanted me to talk to you.

00:32:18.791 --> 00:32:19.876
Just so you know,

00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:24.630
if your lawyer finds anything
that proves I'm not the killer,

00:32:24.714 --> 00:32:27.550
you'll be the one ending up
in a tight spot.

00:32:28.468 --> 00:32:31.721
Everyone thinks I killed your husband.

00:32:32.221 --> 00:32:34.974
But if there's evidence
that proves otherwise…

00:32:39.353 --> 00:32:42.023
you'll be the evil woman

00:32:42.815 --> 00:32:44.901
who made a deal with a psychopath.

00:32:48.988 --> 00:32:49.822
But…

00:32:51.949 --> 00:32:53.785
what if they don't find Mo Eun's DNA,

00:32:54.285 --> 00:32:56.162
and the watch isn't hers either?

00:32:57.747 --> 00:32:59.415
Why would you think that?

00:33:00.374 --> 00:33:02.960
Mo Eun is the real killer.
It'd obviously be hers.

00:33:11.719 --> 00:33:14.097
I LET YOU OUT,
AND THIS IS WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING?

00:33:16.182 --> 00:33:18.476
NOW'S NOT THE TIME TO PLAY DETECTIVE
WITH YOUR LAWYER

00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:26.317
I WARNED YOU. YOU DON'T HAVE TIME.
DON'T GET ANY FUNNY IDEAS.

00:33:29.487 --> 00:33:31.114
SHOULD I JUST EXPOSE EVERYTHING?

00:33:31.197 --> 00:33:34.158
WHAT KIND OF DEAL WE MADE,
AND HOW TOXIC WE ARE TO THE WORLD?

00:33:49.132 --> 00:33:52.552
What happens
if Mo Eun retracts her confession?

00:33:53.803 --> 00:33:55.263
I know you're feeling anxious, but--

00:33:55.346 --> 00:33:56.806
I am anxious!

00:33:58.766 --> 00:34:00.518
She might change her mind.

00:34:00.601 --> 00:34:02.562
My life depends on what she says.

00:34:02.645 --> 00:34:04.438
I told you already.

00:34:04.522 --> 00:34:06.274
We've found a new lead.

00:34:06.858 --> 00:34:10.278
Even if Mo Eun retracts her confession,
we can still win this trial.

00:34:11.654 --> 00:34:12.697
Can't we?

00:34:14.365 --> 00:34:16.033
Actually, all we have

00:34:16.117 --> 00:34:18.619
is her confession
that she's the real killer.

00:34:18.703 --> 00:34:21.414
If my client retracts her confession,

00:34:22.665 --> 00:34:24.333
I can't guarantee what will happen.

00:34:24.417 --> 00:34:25.293
Mr. Jin.

00:34:25.376 --> 00:34:28.504
I'm sorry,
but I'm Ms. Mo's attorney after all.

00:34:28.588 --> 00:34:32.216
If the watch or the DNA isn't proven
to be my client's,

00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:34.010
I'll have to claim her innocence.

00:34:34.093 --> 00:34:37.346
So what if she takes back her words?
Is anyone going to believe her?

00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:40.099
The public probably won't,
but the judge might.

00:34:40.183 --> 00:34:41.559
Her confession did start the trial.

00:34:41.642 --> 00:34:43.269
Wait, Mr. Jin. What are you--

00:34:43.352 --> 00:34:45.438
Yes, I know. I am aware, but…

00:34:48.065 --> 00:34:50.526
something felt different
when I saw her yesterday.

00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:52.820
Well, she is an unpredictable person.

00:34:52.904 --> 00:34:53.738
What did she say?

00:34:54.488 --> 00:34:56.574
Please tell me everything she said.

00:35:01.621 --> 00:35:03.456
Please tell Yun-su…

00:35:05.958 --> 00:35:08.377
that I just had a change of mind.

00:35:08.878 --> 00:35:10.463
That's all.

00:35:21.599 --> 00:35:25.228
SOP'S KINDERGARTEN TEACHER MS. LEE

00:35:26.979 --> 00:35:28.231
Hello, Ms. Lee.

00:35:32.318 --> 00:35:33.152
Oh, Ms. An.

00:35:33.945 --> 00:35:34.779
I'm so sorry.

00:35:35.446 --> 00:35:37.823
I was just on my way out with the kids.

00:35:37.907 --> 00:35:38.824
-But Sop…
-Oh no.

00:35:40.743 --> 00:35:41.994
-I'll go this way.
-Okay.

00:35:43.371 --> 00:35:46.040
We're looking for a missing child
named Lee Sop, age six.

00:35:46.123 --> 00:35:47.875
If you have seen or are with

00:35:47.959 --> 00:35:51.254
a child in pigtails
wearing an orange kindergarten uniform,

00:35:51.337 --> 00:35:53.798
please contact
the nearest information desk.

00:35:55.633 --> 00:35:56.717
Oh, Sop…

00:35:58.678 --> 00:36:00.888
Excuse me,
have you seen a girl about this tall…

00:36:03.224 --> 00:36:04.725
We repeat.

00:36:04.809 --> 00:36:05.977
Ms. An.

00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:07.436
Any sign of her?

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:10.356
…we're looking for a missing child
named Lee Sop, age six.

00:36:10.439 --> 00:36:11.274
What should I do?

00:36:11.357 --> 00:36:14.735
…if you've seen her, please contact
the nearest information desk.

00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:20.491
Sop!

00:36:20.574 --> 00:36:21.867
Sop!

00:36:23.411 --> 00:36:24.287
Sop!

00:36:24.787 --> 00:36:25.621
Sop!

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:31.085
-I'm sorry.
-Are you okay?

00:36:43.097 --> 00:36:45.516
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

00:37:28.142 --> 00:37:28.976
Excuse me.

00:37:30.686 --> 00:37:32.730
Where is she?

00:37:32.813 --> 00:37:34.273
She's over there.

00:37:35.274 --> 00:37:36.150
Mommy!

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:46.869
Where were you?
Mommy's been looking all over for you.

00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:50.581
Did you forget about me
because you were eating something yummy?

00:37:51.082 --> 00:37:53.542
Ma'am, this lady brought her here.

00:37:53.626 --> 00:37:54.460
Oh, right.

00:37:55.336 --> 00:37:56.629
Thank you.

00:37:56.712 --> 00:37:58.756
-Hello.
-Thank you so much.

00:38:03.469 --> 00:38:04.762
Thank you.

00:38:06.097 --> 00:38:07.515
Nice to meet you, Yun-su.

00:38:09.350 --> 00:38:10.935
You know me?

00:38:11.977 --> 00:38:13.771
Mo Eun told me

00:38:14.355 --> 00:38:17.817
you're too busy
to take good care of your daughter.

00:38:18.984 --> 00:38:21.570
She said you shouldn't get any funny ideas

00:38:22.279 --> 00:38:24.323
and just focus on your daughter.

00:38:26.325 --> 00:38:27.451
Mo Eun said

00:38:28.202 --> 00:38:30.746
she's worried you might be getting soft.

00:38:33.874 --> 00:38:34.708
Excuse me.

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:39.004
Sop!

00:38:40.172 --> 00:38:42.591
I should get going now. Take care.

00:38:43.092 --> 00:38:45.511
-Bye, Sop.
-No, don't say anything, Sop.

00:38:46.303 --> 00:38:47.304
Don't.

00:38:47.388 --> 00:38:48.222
Excuse me.

00:38:48.806 --> 00:38:50.224
Just a moment, ma'am.

00:38:54.395 --> 00:38:55.688
Thank you so much.

00:38:55.771 --> 00:38:57.773
Are you the one who brought her here?

00:38:59.692 --> 00:39:00.609
Yes.

00:39:00.693 --> 00:39:03.779
Did you also buy that hairband
and those clothes for her?

00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:07.700
Please give me a call.
Let me make it up to you.

00:39:07.783 --> 00:39:08.701
No, it's okay.

00:39:08.784 --> 00:39:11.412
I was just told to entertain her
for a bit.

00:39:14.248 --> 00:39:15.791
You were told? By whom?

00:39:17.835 --> 00:39:19.420
Who told you to entertain her?

00:39:19.503 --> 00:39:20.379
That's enough.

00:39:21.547 --> 00:39:24.341
She still found Sop,
which I'm grateful for.

00:39:24.842 --> 00:39:26.010
Please just let her go.

00:39:26.719 --> 00:39:29.221
But don't you think it's a little strange?

00:39:30.222 --> 00:39:32.308
Who told you to entertain Sop?

00:39:32.391 --> 00:39:33.434
Who was it? Hang on.

00:39:34.143 --> 00:39:36.395
-I'll find out once the police arrive.
-No!

00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:39.315
You can't call the police.

00:39:40.483 --> 00:39:44.528
You know I don't want people
talking about me anymore.

00:39:44.612 --> 00:39:45.488
But…

00:39:46.614 --> 00:39:47.531
Thank you.

00:39:47.615 --> 00:39:49.283
Thank you. You can go now.

00:39:49.366 --> 00:39:50.743
Thank you so much.

00:39:50.826 --> 00:39:51.827
Thank you.

00:39:53.496 --> 00:39:54.497
Ms. Lee.

00:39:57.791 --> 00:39:59.210
Sop, let's go home.

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:00.669
Come on.

00:40:03.214 --> 00:40:04.048
Sop, let's go.

00:40:11.472 --> 00:40:14.183
We expect rain along with yellow dust.

00:40:14.266 --> 00:40:16.393
It will last from tonight
through the weekend

00:40:16.477 --> 00:40:18.687
into the early hours
of the day after tomorrow.

00:40:18.771 --> 00:40:21.899
In the central regions,
we expect strong winds and heavy rain,

00:40:21.982 --> 00:40:23.526
so please exercise caution.

00:40:24.026 --> 00:40:25.861
We expect 20 to 30 mm hourly downpours

00:40:25.945 --> 00:40:29.406
in the capital area
and western area of Gangwon Province.

00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:32.701
Please take necessary precautions
against road flooding and landslides.

00:40:33.202 --> 00:40:35.955
In the southern regions,
air quality may worsen

00:40:36.038 --> 00:40:38.582
due to the yellow dust.

00:40:39.291 --> 00:40:42.545
Moreover, this rain is likely to persist
for an extended period.

00:40:43.128 --> 00:40:47.049
Please prepare for possible flooding
in lowlands and potential damage to crops.

00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:48.717
I'm Lee Su-jin with your…

00:40:48.801 --> 00:40:50.219
You're just staying one night.

00:40:50.302 --> 00:40:52.012
Wishing you a safe and peaceful day.

00:40:52.096 --> 00:40:53.347
I'll have it all sorted

00:40:54.723 --> 00:40:55.975
by then.

00:41:50.571 --> 00:41:52.448
Hello, it's An Yun-su speaking.

00:41:52.948 --> 00:41:55.701
I fell pretty hard while riding my bike,

00:41:55.784 --> 00:41:57.536
and I think my ankle monitor broke.

00:41:59.288 --> 00:42:02.041
It keeps beeping. What should I do?

00:42:06.086 --> 00:42:06.920
Okay.

00:42:47.002 --> 00:42:49.672
Okay, keep calm. Slow and steady.

00:42:50.381 --> 00:42:51.632
Hold on. I need to reload.

00:42:55.177 --> 00:42:56.178
Hey, from behind!

00:42:57.805 --> 00:42:59.181
That's it.

00:43:12.111 --> 00:43:13.112
Hey, hold on a sec.

00:43:33.006 --> 00:43:34.007
Who is it?

00:43:34.091 --> 00:43:35.926
I'm here for the gas inspection.

00:43:36.427 --> 00:43:39.680
We left a notice,
but you never got back to us.

00:43:39.763 --> 00:43:41.432
But no one lives here now.

00:43:41.515 --> 00:43:44.101
But you're home now.

00:43:44.685 --> 00:43:48.731
If you don't get it inspected now,
others will step in, complicating matters.

00:43:49.231 --> 00:43:51.650
I don't want to work in this rain either.

00:44:20.846 --> 00:44:22.431
Doors closing.

00:44:41.366 --> 00:44:44.745
Oh, my socks got soaked.

00:44:47.289 --> 00:44:48.207
Will it take long?

00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:50.083
No, I'll make it quick.

00:44:51.627 --> 00:44:52.961
Where's the gas valve?

00:45:22.825 --> 00:45:24.701
Okay, that's it.

00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:28.455
Let's go. I'll take the right side.

00:45:32.042 --> 00:45:33.460
Here they come. Let's go.

00:45:36.964 --> 00:45:38.090
I'll take the left.

00:45:42.636 --> 00:45:44.012
Hey, they're coming!

00:45:50.227 --> 00:45:51.311
Nice one.

00:45:52.187 --> 00:45:53.146
I'm going in.

00:45:54.106 --> 00:45:55.607
Okay, follow me.

00:45:55.691 --> 00:45:58.443
-Okay.
-Stabbing the neck is the easiest.

00:45:58.527 --> 00:45:59.403
All right.

00:45:59.486 --> 00:46:01.613
That's where the carotid artery is.

00:46:02.573 --> 00:46:05.742
-Stab there, and you'll get him for sure.
-Wait, let's do it together.

00:46:10.747 --> 00:46:11.623
Are you done?

00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:34.146
We've met before.

00:46:37.816 --> 00:46:38.817
In the elevator.

00:46:41.695 --> 00:46:42.529
Damn it!

00:46:45.324 --> 00:46:46.909
What the hell?

00:46:49.953 --> 00:46:50.913
Damn it!

00:46:58.629 --> 00:47:00.422
Fucking hell.

00:47:01.173 --> 00:47:02.382
Damn it.

00:47:03.717 --> 00:47:04.718
Fuck.

00:47:06.219 --> 00:47:08.472
You crazy fucking bitch!

00:47:08.555 --> 00:47:10.349
Die!

00:47:32.537 --> 00:47:33.956
Please don't kill me.

00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:37.584
Die.

00:47:39.795 --> 00:47:42.047
You must die for us to live.

00:47:44.633 --> 00:47:45.884
Please don't kill me.

00:47:47.469 --> 00:47:48.303
Don't kill me.

00:47:49.429 --> 00:47:51.014
I'm sorry.

00:47:51.890 --> 00:47:52.724
I mean it.

00:48:36.268 --> 00:48:38.103
Consider this divine punishment.

00:52:50.772 --> 00:52:55.777
