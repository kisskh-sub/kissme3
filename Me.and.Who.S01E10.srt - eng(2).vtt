God shouldn't have sent me here
to live as Apo in the first place.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.040
I really don't deserve this life.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.440
Without me,

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.240
Ya wouldn't have had
to go through something like this.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.720
Don't blame yourself.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.160
It's not your fault.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.040
No matter what people think,

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.840
I'll be right by your side.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.000
Will you...

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.240
stay by my side forever,

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.320
Phopthorn?

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.600
Ya?

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.880
Oh...

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.200
Phopthorn.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.120
Are you awake?

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.880
Do you want to get some more sleep?

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.280
You were driving all night.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.440
The sun is so beautiful now.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.000
If I sleep, it's gonna be such a shame.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.200
As long as the sun keeps rising

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.200
and the world doesn't end,

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.880
we can still...

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.680
hope...

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.480
that everything will work out, right?

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.240
As long as you're with me,

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.760
it definitely will.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.080
Thorn...

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.400
I'm no longer M.R. Suriya,

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.720
His Excellency,

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.840
or part of the Suriyadechakorn family.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.560
All I ask is to be your Suriya.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.160
I will forever be your Phopthorn.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.880
To mark the start of our new life,

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.480
I won't spend a single dime
of what I earned as a Suriyadechakorn.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.680
Wait, you can't do that.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.080
That's your wedding ring.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.120
[Pawnshop]

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.360
My bad.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.960
I was too invested.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.520
This is the watch...

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.360
I put all my blood, sweat,
and tears into.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.520
Could you give me an estimate on this?

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.160
That's 4,000 baht.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.800
Huh? That's all?!

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.080
But I bought it for a million!

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.080
A million?!

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.400
Damn right.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.480
You can't judge its value
just by the weight.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.360
That's how it's done here.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.960
If it's not heavy, then it's not pricey.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.520
"If it's not heavy,
then it's not pricey"?

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:56.360
Let's go.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.920
For our future,

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.160
we can't live extravagantly.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.880
The first thing
we'll invest in is a house,

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.600
one that's just alright to live in

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.320
and inexpensive.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.800
We'll later earn money
to make it a home.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.760
Do you think you can make it here?

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:28.960
Of course.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.600
Can you?

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.840
Sure thing.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.880
I love it, actually.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.680
We have a big balcony

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.240
with a beach view.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.000
Now that we have the house,

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.880
we need to find a job.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.720
Hey, hey!

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:45.960
Look.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.040
[We're hiring]

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:47.720
Let's go.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:51.360
I won't use any
of my Suriyadechakorn connections.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.240
I'll find a job using my own potential.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.400
I'm here to apply for a job.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.560
What position are you interested in?

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.360
A CEO.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.480
I have an MBA
from an Ivy League university,

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.720
interned at a 5-star hotel,

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.840
and served as an executive
at Siao Tawan Group.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.760
Do you want my resume
forwarded to your email?

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:12.880
Oh...

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.560
Why don't we start
with cutting the lawn?

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:19.440
Whoa!

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.400
Let me see.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.120
I'm sorry, Phopthorn.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.600
I brought you here to struggle.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.000
What are you talking about?

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.360
This is what I'm good at.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.600
Don't think too much of it.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.360
You can use mine for now.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.680
I'll be right back.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.920
Whoa, that smells divine.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.560
Be careful, it's hot.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:10.720
See?

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.560
I knew it.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:13.800
It's hot!

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:15.680
Look.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.720
This is how it's done.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.960
Peel off the lid, fold it,

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.200
and shape it nicely into a cup.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.760
And now you have a tiny cup.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.320
You're gonna eat it just like that?

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.640
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached...

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.600
- Honey!
- Where's His goddamn Serene Highness?

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.800
Tell him to speak with me immediately!

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:12.960
Where is he?!

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.640
Honey, calm down,

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:15.840
or your blood pressure will rise.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:17.760
Tycoon Meng.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.440
Move! Don't get in my way!

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.600
Honey.

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.120
Honey...

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.000
Where has that son of yours taken mine?

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.560
Didn't you hear on that day

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.440
that Suriya was no longer my son?

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.920
Don't you think
you should do something?

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.720
If you let them

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.240
run away for too long,

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.880
the one who will suffer most
is my son, Apo!

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.280
What would that brat be suffering from?

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.160
He's more than fortunate
to be living in this world.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.760
What nonsense are you babbling?!

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.400
If you don't believe me,

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.600
ask that phony son of yours.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.840
You sure inherited that revolting nature
from your ancestors.

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:04.600
Did you never want our sons
to get married,

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.080
so you came up with that scheme
to ruin their wedding?!

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.160
Good!

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.920
If that's the case, I'll consider

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.760
Suriya and Apo's marriage
as if it never happened.

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.760
And there will never be
another marriage

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.600
between the two families!

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.440
Fine!

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.960
This wouldn't have taken so long
if you'd spoken up!

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.000
From now on,

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.600
the Yue family

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.120
and the Suriyadechakorns

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.840
are through!

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000
I'll have a word with him.

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.320
If you continue to be this stubborn,

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.280
eventually,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.600
you will have no one left by your side.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.200
Any luck in contacting those two?

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.360
Are you worried about Apo?

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:56.600
Mm.

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:01.080
Wait...

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.560
I mean, only as a friend.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.400
Do you still think I'm into him?

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:08.800
Why the sad face?

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.120
I'm not.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.440
I'm not sad.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.800
I don't know how they're doing,

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.480
but I'm sure

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:25.720
that M.R. Ya
will take the best care of Apo.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.720
Now, I'm more worried about my family.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:32.360
It's like a war.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.480
Ever since that happened,

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.720
Father has been taking it out on us,

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.360
so the vibe is totally off.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.960
Also, Mother is now
giving him the cold shoulder.

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:52.000
As for Daonuer,
he cried for no one but M.R. Ya.

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:57.760
Then,

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.640
should we put out the fire
with something cold?

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.520
Wait here. I'll be back.

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.080
Here,

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.600
your favorite ice cream flavor.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:23.640
You remember that?

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:25.920
It's not that hard.

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.520
You're pretty attentive, aren't you?

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:30.960
Are you gonna take it?

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.160
Look at you

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:40.560
saying that my eyes widen
when I eat something good.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:43.800
You also act like a kid
when you have it.

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.320
Well, I can't help that it's good.

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:49.560
Look over here.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:50.320
This way?

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:51.880
This way!

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.840
You make a mess like a kid, too.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:08.080
All of a sudden,
why do I wanna kiss you?

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:14.200
Hey...

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.120
You do realize...

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:22.240
that I can still read your mind
when we touch, right?

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.200

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:33.000
♫Tonight, with just our gaze,♫

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:42.040
♫It's clear that we're in love♫

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:46.960
Aren't you gonna eat your ice cream?

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.640
It's gonna melt, you know?

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.360
Do you know what I'm thinking?

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:27.240
You don't wanna
cut the lawn anymore, right?

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.800
You sure know a lot,
you naughty one.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:32.840
Whoa, Ya!

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.280
Actually, I'm thinking that...

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.000
once we save up some money,

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:46.440
we'll have our wedding here again...

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.360
right by this beach.

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.880
See that area over there?

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:01.240
That's where the table
for our wedding souvenirs will be.

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.920
Next to that,

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:07.520
there'll be a beautiful display
of our photos

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.440
to welcome the guests.

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.080
And where we're standing now

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:20.760
is where the altar will be

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.280
for our vows.

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.440
It's gonna be simple

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:29.720
and surrounded by
the people we love.

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.440
That's going to be perfect.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000
For you...

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.800
Does all that...

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.160
really sound perfect?

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.120
It sure is,

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.720
with you right next to me.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.320
- Let's go.
- Hm?

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:04.560
Where are we going?

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.840
- Oh, Yi.
- Mother?

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:22.120
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:24.320
How has it been, Mother?

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:26.240
Has anyone gotten a hold of Ya?

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:33.680
It's all because of Apo.

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.560
I never thought he'd be
such a bad influence on Ya.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.800
It has nothing to do with Apo, dear.

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:47.440
All this time,

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.960
I might've just misjudged them.

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:58.040
They genuinely love each other.

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.160
Mother...

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.200
Yi, my dear,

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:06.600
it's all my fault.

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:09.120
I'm really sorry

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:12.000
for dragging you into this.

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.560
From now on,

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.560
I will give you back your freedom.

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:20.000
You can move on now, dear.

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:23.720
I'm happy

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:26.200
that Ya has found someone he loves

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:27.960
and who truly loves him back.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.160
Yi...

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:35.680
I need to thank you...

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:40.520
for once making Ya happy.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:46.560
Uh...

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:47.600
So,

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.280
is Father upstairs, Mother?

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:53.640
I was planning on visiting him, too.

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:55.400
He is.

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:56.480
At his office.

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:58.920
- Right, please excuse me, then.
- Of course.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.200
You all know
I'm in search of a new Dragon's Belly.

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.800
Stuff like this takes time.

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.240
But our time is money.

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:39.960
The land hasn't been found yet,

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.720
and now there's a scandal.

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.520
I guess I have to say goodbye.

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.680
Would you mind a quick talk, Father?

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:55.320
Come in.

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.840
Are you stressed
about the Dragon's Belly?

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:02.280
Have a seat.

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:03.640
Thank you.

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:07.360
So...

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.920
I heard that...

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:14.960
after Ya released a statement
about not buying the land,

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:19.000
Siao Tawan's partners have been
finding ways to break the deal.

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.400
My son is such a good-for-nothing.

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:25.000
Suddenly, he gave in
and acted like a saint.

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.080
Even if we don't buy it,

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.680
someone else will go after it anyway.

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.800
You're right about that.

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.520
If it were me,

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:39.400
I'd take that chance to improve
Siao Tawan Group's image.

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:43.400
I'd put the money I earned
from the hotel business

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:47.280
into a fund to support orphanages
across the country,

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:49.960
instead of...

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:53.560
just saying no one will touch the land.

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.720
I'm not saying this to put Ya down,

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:00.400
but I just thought...

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:02.800
this was how it was meant to be.

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:08.000
You seem to have a good understanding
of management and investment.

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.000
It would've been great
if you were still with Ya.

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:13.400
Did you two break up

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:15.320
because my son was a good-for-nothing?

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:16.680
Uh...

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:18.040
No, Father.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:19.840
We...

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.560
We were forced to break up

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:27.080
because Ya had to get engaged with Apo.

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:33.120
Maybe I was wrong all this time.

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:36.760
The person who deserves
to be Ya's life partner,

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:39.840
is someone who toughens him up,

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:42.640
not someone who makes him weak.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.040
And I really think that person is you.

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:54.280
Can you turn Suriya
into his old self, Yi?

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:57.400
Definitely.

00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:00.600
I promise I will bring Ya

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.000
back into the Suriyadechakorn family.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.080
Thank you so much.

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.160
Should he come back,

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.240
I'll reconsider the marriage.

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:15.200
Ya should only marry someone
who deserves him.

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:18.360
Thank you.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.200
Milady!

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.720
Milady! Milady!

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:27.280
Anyone, please call an ambulance!

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:28.320
- Milady...
- Milady!

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:29.560
Milady!

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.880
Is anyone around? Call an ambulance!

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:34.880
Milady!

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:36.240
Milady, are you alright?

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.360
Pick up the phone, Ya...

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:52.440
Doctor...

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.240
Uncle,

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:54.680
how is Mother doing?

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.200
She's out of critical condition.

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:58.280
Luckily, she got here just in time.

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:01.640
Thank you so much, Uncle.

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:03.000
Don't mention it.

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:04.400
For someone this important
to my nephew,

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:07.000
of course, I had to call
the best medical team.

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.800
Was it because of...

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:10.760
her heart disease?

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:11.640
It was.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.720
Her relapse was due in part
to accumulated fatigue.

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.440
Now, please excuse me.

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:20.800
Wait...

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.400
How long has she had heart disease?

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:27.560
Father...

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:29.600
Please sit down for now.

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:39.840
Still haven't gotten a hold of Ya?

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:54.400
Butler Francois...

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.200
I need your help.

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:01.520
Ya!

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:02.880
I'm back!

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:04.240
Wow!

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:05.520
Whoa! What do we have here?

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:08.000
Lady Pripprao's signature chicken soup.

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.040
Wow...

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.400
Mm, that smells good!

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:13.520
Isn't it?

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:14.880
Wanna take a bite?

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.360
Wonder if it could compare
to your mother's cooking...

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:20.880
Wait...

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.880
Is that phone still working?

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:28.440
Your Excellency.

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:31.200
Francois?

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:33.440
That'd be me.

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:35.200
Your family passed on the message that

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:36.640
Lady Pripprao had a relapse
of her heart disease.

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:38.200
She's now hospitalized.

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:42.560
How is she doing now?

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:46.120
She's safe now

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:47.520
and in the recovery room.

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.120
Okay...

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:52.200
Then, please take care
of her on my behalf,

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:54.440
and call me to keep me posted.

00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:57.800
Ya.

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:02.000
I don't have the heart to see Mother.

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:04.080
I'm the reason she ended up like this.

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:07.240
I deserve to be out of the family.

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.200
No matter what,

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:14.600
they are still your family.

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:19.000
They need you

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.200
as much as you need them.

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:26.840
I didn't want to leave my family either.

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:34.600
Hello, Francois?

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:35.640
Yes, Your Excellency?

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:38.040
The cell reception is quite poor.

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:39.640
Can you hear me?

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:40.760
Send a helicopter.

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.200
I'll send you my location.

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:44.800
Uh, Your Excellency.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000
Right now, we're facing
a devastating storm.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:49.040
It would be impossible at the moment.

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:53.200
We need our car.

00:27:58.520 --> 00:27:59.520
[Pripprao Suriyadechakorn: NPO]

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:04.040
How come you never told me

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.280
that you have been ill?

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:11.760
It's not that
she didn't want to tell you.

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:15.440
You were just never there for her.

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:18.680
Ironic, isn't it?

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.000
We might be able to read anyone's mind,

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:26.160
but with the people closest to us,

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:29.480
we never really know them
inside and out.

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:35.200
Because of this ability,

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:40.240
I know how selfish
every single soul in this world is.

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:44.600
I don't wish for my successor

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:46.680
to be frail

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.720
and easily shaken.

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:50.360
And how does loving someone

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:53.360
make us frail?

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:59.680
What if the legacy we're passing

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:03.200
forces them to marry
someone they don't love?

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:06.360
Am I next in line?

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:11.320
I've found someone I love,

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:15.680
and I won't accept losing him.

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:21.120
And in case you haven't realized yet,

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.560
Ya ran away

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:30.400
because you tried to
take the person he loves from him.

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.560
Sir, can I borrow the car?

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.000
It's an emergency.

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:48.800
Please.

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:52.920
You can have this,

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.600
and I'll return the car, too.

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:01.240
Thank you, sir.

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:02.400
Come on!

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:15.240
Hey...

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:17.120
Hm?

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.200
Are you okay?

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:23.480
I am.

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:31.560
Hey, Ashin.

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:32.720
What's up?

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:34.920
Where are you and Apo?

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:37.520
I know who's behind Apo's accident.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:51.880
Darling...

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:57.680
Milady...

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:00.360
Milady!

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:01.320
Milady!

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.720
What's the matter with you?

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:07.680
And what are these?

00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:12.480
Why are there
so many flowers everywhere?

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.120
I even thought
I woke up in a flower shop.

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:18.640
I...

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:21.680
I didn't know which flowers you liked,

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:23.920
so I bought everything.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.280
All this time,

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.760
I have never once
cared for you properly.

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:37.560
Can we start over, please?

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:40.600
Please?

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:55.000
A lotus?

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:57.480
Do I remind you of the Buddha?

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:06.480
Milady...

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:08.560
For all this time,

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:13.720
our marriage might have felt
like we were just strangers.

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:16.400
But when I realized...

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:20.360
I might lose you,

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:22.080
I...

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:24.440
I finally understood

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:27.240
what it feels like...

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.280
to...

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.440
lose someone you love.

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:38.080
Darling...

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:42.680
Please, just...

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.480
give me another chance.

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:01.920
Next time,

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:05.600
could you give me a rose?

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:07.960
Sure, sure.

00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:09.120
Of course.

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:14.600
But the lotus is quite a beauty, right?

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:21.200
Mother, are you awake?

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:22.240
My dear Yi.

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.560
Thank you for coming to visit.

00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:27.880
May I examine you?

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:29.200
Please do.

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:33.120
Excuse me.

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:37.240
Uh...

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:39.680
Yi?

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:40.680
Yes?

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:43.040
May I talk with you?

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:44.680
Sure.

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:56.320
Yes, Father?

00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:59.560
What do you want to talk about?

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:04.600
About the deal I made with you earlier...

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:07.320
I've thought it over.

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:12.920
I apologize

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:14.360
for saying such things.

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:17.440
What is this, Father?

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:21.320
Why are you suddenly
going back on your word?

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.160
It's my fault

00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:25.440
for insisting on changing my course.

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:30.360
But now, I think it's time

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:35.040
to let my son decide
what makes him happy.

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:38.480
But, Father...

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:40.920
I really do love Ya.

00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:44.000
I can even help him

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:45.680
when it comes to Siao Tawan Group.

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.320
Please trust me, Father.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.760
But when it comes to his feelings...

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:55.560
I can't take control of them.

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:02.040
You gave me a f*cking false hope

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:04.200
and suddenly broke your own damn word?

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:08.080
Father, can you please reconsider?

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:12.280
Yi...

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:16.960
Do you really love him that much?

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:18.960
Yes,

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.560
I love him more than you can imagine.

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:27.040
So much so that I thought
about getting rid of Apo.

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:30.280
Too bad that bastard survived
and turned into a thorn in my side.

00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:35.400
Apo's accident...

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:38.200
You were behind it, were you?

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:39.480
Wait...

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.680
How the hell does His Serene Highness
know about the accident?

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:48.400
What do you mean?

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:51.600
You hit Apo
with that car, didn't you?

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:54.920
You were the one
who hit Apo with that car, right?!

00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:56.120
Weren't you?!

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.200
Answer me!

00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:58.200
Weren't you?

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:00.240
- Weren't you?!
- Ugh!

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:03.280
How on earth
would I hit him with a car?!

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:06.400
Damn you...

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:24.400
Why is he suspicious about the accident?

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:26.320
Did he know something?

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:41.360
Oh, Apo?

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:44.480
What brought you here?

00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:49.800
Whatever brought you here,

00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:52.280
I hope it leads you back
to where you belong.

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:55.400
Hold up, Apo.

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:59.280
I'm just here to apologize to Ya.

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:03.880
Others might fall for your little act,

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:08.040
but I can see right through you.

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:12.440
You're here to take Ya back.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.800
It's not what you think.

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:18.320
I just haven't seen Ya for so long.

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:19.520
Since he's back,

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:21.560
I thought I should meet up with him.

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:24.080
Really?

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:25.400
Mm.

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:28.480
One more thing...

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:30.680
I don't think

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:32.760
Ya will ever want to see you again.

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:36.600
I know

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:41.040
your breakup wasn't
because of the long distance,

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:43.920
but...

00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:48.040
because of your affair.

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:51.720
Am I right?

00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:56.080
Thirsty?

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:00.480
Let me tell you something.

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:04.280
Even though he wasn't engaged to me,

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:10.960
he would never go back to you.

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:16.040
Now, leave Ya alone.

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:18.760
It pisses me off.

00:38:58.520 --> 00:38:59.520
Hi, there.

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:09.600
Are you sure, Ashin?

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:12.240
Yi did it?

00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:13.920
I am.

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:15.640
Francois and I
just got the new evidence.

00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:17.800
I called the police
to bust him right at the hospital.

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:19.840
M.R. Ya!

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:21.320
Oh.

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:25.840
How are you holding up?

00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:27.760
I'm okay.

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:29.480
Well, how's Mother doing?

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:30.880
Who's with her right now?

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.080
Just Father?

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:33.320
I saw...

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:34.960
Yi stopped by this morning.

00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:39.480
What?

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:40.720
Hey!

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:42.680
M.R. Ya.

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:44.560
What's happening?

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:46.920
Yi is the one behind Apo's accident?

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:49.080
Yeah, I wish it wasn't true.

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:50.120
Father.

00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:52.240
Where's Mother?

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:54.120
Yi's probably taken her somewhere now.

00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:57.560
I'll take care of that.

00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:59.800
- As for you...
- The nurse went to get the doctor.

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:01.840
Go after them!

00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:03.280
Yes.

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:05.440
- Chan, get me the car.
- Yes?

00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:07.200
I'll go down and talk to the police.

00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:07.960
Okay...

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:14.520
That's the car, officer!

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:17.160
The suspect has taken the hostage
to Highway 8!

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:19.880
M.R. Ya, get in the car.

00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:21.760
Chan, go take care of Father,

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:23.040
and keep an eye on Apo.

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:24.400
I'll take the car.

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:25.440
I'm coming with you.

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:26.400
Hey, Apo!

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:28.280
You can't. It's too dangerous.

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:29.320
Stay here.

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:33.760
It's okay.

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:35.720
He's gonna be fine.

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:39.720
Come on, Apo.

00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:43.640
- Chan, take care of Father.
- Apo!

00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:56.520
Yi...

00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:58.600
Don't do this, my dear.

00:40:58.880 --> 00:40:59.760
Yi...

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.880
We can talk.

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:03.760
Yi, this is not gonna end well.

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:05.840
Yi, don't do...

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:06.960
Shut the f*ck up!

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:19.040
[Y MART: 500 meters ahead]

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:29.040
This street's exactly like
the one in the other world.

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.320
If I keep going, I'll see Soi 7,

00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:33.560
and Y MART will be at its entrance.

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:40.640
Is it in reverse?

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:48.880
From the route he took to escape,

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:50.280
he'll come this way for sure.

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:04.720
Phopthorn!

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:05.520
Hey...

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:12.200
Are you okay, Thorn?!

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:13.240
Thorn!

00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:14.920
Thorn!

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:30.040
Where am I?

00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:37.200
Ya!

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:39.480
Tor...

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:42.400
Tai!

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:44.640
Papa...

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:46.920
Mama!

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:48.400
Ashin.

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:50.880
Ya!

00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:54.000
Hi...

00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:05.760
Hello,

00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:08.080
Apo in disguise.

00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:11.840
Apo...

00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:25.520
Thorn!

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:26.560
Thorn!

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:28.640
Doctor! Doctor!

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:29.760
Can you come over here?

00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:33.760
How's it feel,

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:37.680
stealing my fancy life

00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:41.400
and my fiancé?

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:44.960
Are you enjoying this life?

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:48.480
Too bad...

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:51.760
Your time is up,

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.000
Phopthorn.

00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:56.240
I'm taking back what's mine.

00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:58.440
Apo...

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:02.360
I never meant to steal your life.

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:05.640
If you want it back now,

00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:09.200
I'll return it to you.

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:11.320
But...

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:15.840
can I just have a moment
to say goodbye?

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:19.520
Getting hooked?

00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:24.760
The real one is back,

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:29.600
so step back, you phony.

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:30.960
But...

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:35.240
I promised Ya

00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:37.800
that I'd be right by his side.

00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:42.480
Back off.

00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:45.040
I'm going back to my body.

00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:47.720
Thorn!

00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:49.160
Thorn, no!

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:50.760
Sir, please step aside.

00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:51.800
Wake up, Thorn!

00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:53.560
- Thorn!
- Please take a step back.

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:54.760
Don't leave me, Thorn!

00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:57.320
Charge it to 50 joules.

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:03.320
For the second shock,
charge it to 100 joules.

00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:07.480
Apo!

00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:10.640
Apo, I'm begging you!

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:12.320
I've never asked
for anything in my entire life,

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:14.240
but can I have a moment
to say goodbye?

00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:16.960
Just let me see Ya for the last time,

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.320
that's all I'm asking for.

00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:29.280
I don't want to just disappear

00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:33.880
and leave him with sadness.

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:37.600
I just want to say my last goodbye.

00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:41.360
I want him to know

00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:43.640
why I have to leave,

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:48.560
and I want to tell him
to keep living his life,

00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:54.720
even if I can't be with him anymore.

00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:58.800
After all this time living in your body,

00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:01.080
I know all too well

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.160
that I'm just a disguise,

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:05.400
and when the moment comes,

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.880
I have to give everything back
to the real one.

00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:09.720
So,

00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:11.800
don't you worry.

00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:15.640
I'm not going to steal your perfect life.

00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:20.040
I promise...

00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:21.960
that once I say goodbye to Ya,

00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:26.160
I will return what's yours, Apo.

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:32.200
Ugh!

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:33.720
Sike.

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:37.720
What do you mean?

00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:42.360
I was gonna mess with you
a little longer,

00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:43.880
but...

00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:46.600
it gives me such an ick

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:49.240
seeing myself this desperate.

00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:54.440
You're...

00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:57.120
not here to get your life back?

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:00.160
I wanted to.

00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:04.560
But after all this time,

00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:06.360
I realize...

00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:14.400
how good you are as Apo in disguise.

00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:17.720
You're so good that...

00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:19.800
the real one, like me, feels ashamed.

00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:24.120
You helped the Yue family
reconcile again.

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:26.320
When I was there,

00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:28.960
I argued with Ashin every day.

00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:32.400
I barely ever saw
Papa and Mama as happy

00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:34.240
or laughing

00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:36.760
as much as they do
when they're with you.

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:40.640
You also take great care of Ya.

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:42.880
And most importantly,

00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:45.120
you love him,

00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:49.440
and he loves you.

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:56.040
From now on,

00:47:57.360 --> 00:47:58.960
you've gotta stop thinking

00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:01.360
you're Apo in disguise.

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:03.400
From this moment on,

00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:06.120
you're the real Apo.

00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:07.840
Keep that in mind.

00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:10.960
What about you?

00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:15.640
If I'm living your life,

00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:18.360
then what about you?

00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:23.000
I found a place where I belong,

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:27.840
and someone who sees me
as the real one.

00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:33.800
I have one last wish to ask of you.

00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:36.880
Can you continue being Apo

00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:39.000
for Papa and Mama?

00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:42.480
I just don't want them to be sad

00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:44.600
if they know I'm gone.

00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:49.160
I promise.

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:53.040
It's time for me to go.

00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:57.080
Nice to meet you,

00:48:58.400 --> 00:48:59.680
Apo in disguise.

00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:07.400
Right,

00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:10.040
one more thing.

00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:12.680
I know you like sour curry,

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:14.720
but it's not like
you have to eat it so often.

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:18.400
I hate climbing wattles.

00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:20.440
What vegetable on earth

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.000
is that so stinky?

00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:26.480
Take care of my family and Ya for me,

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.320
and live my life to the fullest,

00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:33.400
Phopthorn.

00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:41.200
Nurse, charge it to 150 joules.

00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:50.480
Doctor!

00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:52.160
He's stable now.

00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:11.480
Thorn...

00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:15.160
Come back to me...

00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:21.240
Don't leave me.

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:23.680
I'm right here, Thorn.

00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:24.600
Ya!

00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:26.280
Ya!

00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:28.080
Ya, can you hear me?

00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:29.640
Ya!

00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:31.360
Phopthorn!

00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:41.360
Master.

00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:44.520
Follow the voice of your beloved,

00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:49.560
and you will get another chance at life.

00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:12.520
Come back to me...

00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:47.960
Thorn!

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.320
Thorn, are you finally awake?

00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:57.640
Thorn!

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:12.000
I thought you were never coming back.

00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:30.320
I told you

00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:34.480
I'd be right by your side.

00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:39.240
I'm not going anywhere now.

00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:53.640
Plus,

00:52:57.280 --> 00:52:59.640
I promised Apo

00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:02.200
that I'd take good care of you.

00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:08.120
Apo!

00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:09.680
- My dear!
- Apo!

00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:10.600
Po!

00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:12.160
- Goodness...
- My dear son...

00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:13.520
Are you finally awake?

00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:15.000
Are you awake, dear?

00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:18.800
Po is awake!

00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:44.040
Are you saying

00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:46.760
you met the real Apo?

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:51.800
Yes.

00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:55.720
The curtain has fallen on an elite
whose name begins with Y,

00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:57.640
the suspect in a hit-and-run case,

00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:00.400
after he was involved in an accident
while fleeing from the police.

00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:04.960
First responders rushed him
to the hospital,

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.720
where a medical team provided
the best possible care,

00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:10.640
but he later died.

00:54:38.360 --> 00:54:39.240
Here you go.

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.520
Welcome home,

00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:48.640
Phopthorn.

00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:25.840
I apologize for what happened!

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:27.960
You can blame it all on me.

00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:35.160
Come on,

00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:37.240
I don't hold a grudge
against you anymore.

00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:41.320
There's really no need
for such formal apologies.

00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:43.680
Hm, it seems that

00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:45.480
the apple doesn't fall far
from the tree!

00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:51.800
How long are you going to
keep standing?

00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:53.320
Aren't you eating?

00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:54.880
Sit down.

00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:57.520
Just sit down.

00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:02.840
Please enjoy the meal.

00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:06.080
Apo,

00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:08.560
I apologize

00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:10.680
for saying those horrible things.

00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:13.280
Oh, it's all good.

00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:16.400
I actually kinda forgot them now.

00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:21.960
Good, good.

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:27.160
I don't know

00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:30.160
what His Serene Highness
meant the other day,

00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:32.880
nor do I know

00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:35.720
if you're the real Apo.

00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:39.560
But all the happiness
your mama and I

00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:41.640
get from this Apo

00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:44.640
is never phony.

00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:49.120
Papa...

00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:51.280
Come what may,

00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:53.960
you're our son

00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:56.560
and Ashin's little brother.

00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:01.200
Mama.

00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:04.920
Let me join.

00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:08.400
Ashin, come here!

00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:10.520
You guys are so dramatic.

00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:12.600
Ashin, come here.

00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:49.920
I'm full.

00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:52.560
Thank you
for inviting me out for a meal.

00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:54.840
Mm. No problem.

00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:06.280
"Super Moon: The Moon-Viewing Festival."

00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:08.680
Are you secretly
asking me out on a date?

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:09.680
What?

00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:11.920
What have we been doing all this time?

00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:13.560
I guess those weren't dates,

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.600
just two guys hanging out.

00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:19.880
So are you free this Friday?

00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:21.960
Uh...

00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:24.040
I...

00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:28.280
I have a gig at Siao Tawan Bar.

00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:30.960
What about next time?

00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:34.160
It's gonna be a long wait, then.

00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:36.240
I'm sorry...

00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:38.840
How about

00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:41.000
we...

00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:43.640
do something else later?

00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:46.880
Mm, fine.

00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:47.880
Here.

00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:52.960
Then...

00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:54.800
I'm going upstairs now.

00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:56.040
Well...

00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:57.920
Drive home safely, alright?

00:58:58.240 --> 00:58:59.040
Okay.

00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:00.400
Bye-bye.

00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:04.560
Uh...

00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:06.480
Bye-bye.

00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:16.720
Well, are you free tonight?

00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:20.160
Uh...

00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:23.160
So...

00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:26.480
Do you wanna...

00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:28.840
gaze at the moon at my place?

00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:41.240
Take a seat.

00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:43.840
I'll show you something cool.

00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:46.280
- Okay
- Mm.

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:16.240
It's too bad there's no Super Moon.

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:23.400
Uh...

01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:28.360
There.

01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:31.080
It's still not as big.

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:38.640
I'm sorry.

01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:39.560
It's fine.

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:43.160
Do you know

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:45.600
what a Super Moon is?

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:50.240
I don't.

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:55.360
A Super Moon happens

01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:58.480
when the Moon is at its closest point

01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:01.240
to the Earth in its orbit.

01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:07.360
I don't want to say it out loud,

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:10.840
but I'll let you read my mind

01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:15.160
because there's something
I want you to know.

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:17.640
So...

01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:21.840
I think...

01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:23.520
I've fallen for you.

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:30.880
I've fallen for you, too, Tailah.

01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:34.080
I've fallen so hard.

01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:37.320
You mean the world to me.

01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:47.440
- Go ahead and scatter all the petals.
- Go on.

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:51.520
Thank you.

01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:02.760
I vow to you, the person
right in front of me,

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:05.280
that I will forever be by your side.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.600
The reason I love you
is not about who you are,

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:12.040
but rather

01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:15.000
the person I become when I'm with you.

01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:19.560
I thought I was a workaholic

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:21.120
who didn't need love,

01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:23.000
someone who never had to
give his heart to anyone.

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:26.240
But that wasn't me at all.

01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:29.880
Thank you for introducing me
to the real Suriya.

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:33.120
Thank you for being in my life

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:36.520
and changing my whole world.

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:41.240
I love you.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.360
Thank you

01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:49.400
for loving me for who I really am,

01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:52.400
and for giving me

01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:54.840
a reason to live in this world.

01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:59.480
Meeting you is the biggest gift
I could ever ask for.

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:02.200
I promise

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:05.280
that whenever you're stressed,

01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:10.520
I'll be there to ease them.

01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:17.760
And whenever you decide to go on
some tall, scary ride,

01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:19.960
or you've got something on your mind,

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:23.000
I promise

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:26.520
I'll be right there beside you.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.240
I'll be your real one, forever.

01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:06.320
Ready?

01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:07.520
It's coming!

01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:15.560
Hey!

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:18.640
Do you guys want to take over the altar?

01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:19.840
What do you say?

01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:21.680
Just tie another knot!

01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:23.920
- Yeah!
- Tie the knot.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.120
- Tie the knot!
- Tie the knot!

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:31.080
- Go on, tie the knot!
- Tie the knot!

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:38.680
♫Pretending to be someone else
is breaking me♫

01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:43.680
♫All I want is to be myself, you see♫

01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:47.840
♫Neither sweet nor deep♫

01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:54.800
♫I don't want to be like others,
putting on a charade♫

01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:59.920
♫Can I just be myself
when I'm in your arms,♫

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:02.680
♫Being who I truly am?♫

01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:41.000
I love you, Thorn.

01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:44.840
I love you, too, Ya.

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:03.600
What?

01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:06.680
We kissed way too much today.

01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:10.120
Go!

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:24.560
For this...

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:26.400
I'll let you win.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.120
Ya...

01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:51.680
Don't...

01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:54.040
Don't kiss me there...

01:10:56.600 --> 01:11:00.280
You know this is my sensitive area...

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:19.840
Your kiss...

01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:22.840
There's nothing I love
more than your kiss.

01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:34.200
Where do you like it?

01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:54.800
Ya...

01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:56.440
Where are your lips going?

01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:58.080
Don't tease me.

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:02.680
Stop it...

01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:03.840
or else...

01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:05.160
I won't be able to handle it.
