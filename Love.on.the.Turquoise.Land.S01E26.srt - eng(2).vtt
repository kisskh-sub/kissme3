(Fortune)

Mr. Yan.

00:06:26.287 --> 00:06:27.128
Fixed it?

00:06:45.448 --> 00:06:46.008
Yes.

00:07:45.847 --> 00:07:46.727
It's been so long.

00:07:47.968 --> 00:07:49.287
Lin Xirou should've already known

00:07:49.287 --> 00:07:50.688
Yan Tuo was rescued.

00:07:51.927 --> 00:07:53.568
But there is no news so far.

00:07:54.287 --> 00:07:55.648
That makes me feel uneasy.

00:07:58.167 --> 00:07:59.128
I'll be careful.

00:08:03.807 --> 00:08:06.568
Should I bring Lin Ling and Liu Changxi

00:08:06.847 --> 00:08:08.328
to the South Mountain base first?

00:08:09.287 --> 00:08:11.208
That can ease your pressure.

00:08:14.807 --> 00:08:15.968
That place doesn't suit them.

00:08:17.008 --> 00:08:18.727
I can handle it for now.

00:08:20.807 --> 00:08:22.367
Lin Xirou has no more cards to play.

00:08:23.487 --> 00:08:25.047
I have no idea what she might do.

00:08:28.128 --> 00:08:28.807
Got it.

00:08:32.088 --> 00:08:34.328
Update me anytime.

00:08:57.607 --> 00:08:59.367
We might take action recently.

00:09:01.328 --> 00:09:02.527
I suggested to Xing Shen

00:09:03.048 --> 00:09:04.288
that you could join us.

00:09:06.288 --> 00:09:07.448
Are you pitying me?

00:09:09.288 --> 00:09:10.208
I'm inviting you.

00:09:12.208 --> 00:09:13.367
But I still feel

00:09:14.088 --> 00:09:15.487
I can't fully integrate with you.

00:09:20.808 --> 00:09:23.168
When badgers dig burrows,

00:09:23.727 --> 00:09:25.968
they drive animals out from underground,

00:09:26.168 --> 00:09:27.487
so coyotes can catch them.

00:09:28.247 --> 00:09:30.727
When coyotes chase prey,

00:09:30.928 --> 00:09:32.688
they also drive them into burrows,

00:09:32.887 --> 00:09:34.127
so badgers can catch them.

00:09:34.367 --> 00:09:35.767
They're different species,

00:09:36.168 --> 00:09:37.088
but working together

00:09:37.408 --> 00:09:38.647
is still a better choice.

00:09:49.088 --> 00:09:50.208
Ever since meeting Jiang,

00:09:51.367 --> 00:09:53.408
my life has revolved around him.

00:09:55.168 --> 00:09:56.007
I used to think

00:09:56.968 --> 00:09:57.767
that without him,

00:09:57.887 --> 00:09:59.127
my life would collapse.

00:10:00.808 --> 00:10:01.928
But now,

00:10:03.367 --> 00:10:05.607
even if I'm a badger hiding underground,

00:10:06.647 --> 00:10:08.328
I can still meet coyote friends.

00:10:15.887 --> 00:10:16.647
Continue.

00:11:13.487 --> 00:11:15.367
Ms. Lu, where are the eggs?

00:11:15.647 --> 00:11:16.288
Over here.

00:11:24.847 --> 00:11:25.527
Eggs.

00:11:25.847 --> 00:11:26.487
Thanks.

00:11:30.127 --> 00:11:31.168
No more dumplings.

00:11:31.168 --> 00:11:32.767
The fridge can't hold anymore.

00:11:32.808 --> 00:11:33.568
This is different.

00:11:33.568 --> 00:11:35.448
I'm making wontons this time.

00:11:35.448 --> 00:11:36.808
Don't those also go in the fridge?

00:11:38.247 --> 00:11:39.007
Tuo.

00:11:39.168 --> 00:11:40.007
Is this enough?

00:11:40.007 --> 00:11:41.288
Yes. Chop them, please.

00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:42.007
Okay.

00:11:42.887 --> 00:11:44.007
What should I cut them into?

00:11:44.127 --> 00:11:45.847
Into small ones. Watch your fingers.

00:11:45.928 --> 00:11:46.487
Got it.

00:11:52.168 --> 00:11:53.448
You better think it through.

00:11:55.408 --> 00:11:56.448
What?

00:11:57.688 --> 00:11:58.767
Now,

00:11:58.767 --> 00:12:00.808
their whole family is here.

00:12:03.168 --> 00:12:05.288
You always complained
that the house was too quiet.

00:12:05.568 --> 00:12:07.208
Now, you're finding it annoying?

00:12:07.928 --> 00:12:09.607
Your pleasure matters most.

00:12:16.408 --> 00:12:17.007
Morning.

00:12:20.288 --> 00:12:20.928
Morning.

00:12:27.487 --> 00:12:29.968
Mr. Yan is such a good cook.

00:12:30.887 --> 00:12:31.767
I can say

00:12:31.847 --> 00:12:33.847
Tuo is an instant noodle expert.

00:12:34.992 --> 00:12:36.688
Grew up pretty much on our own.

00:12:36.688 --> 00:12:37.887
So I made instant noodles

00:12:37.887 --> 00:12:39.087
for Lin Ling in various ways.

00:12:39.087 --> 00:12:40.247
Soaked, boiled, or dry mixed.

00:12:50.328 --> 00:12:51.127
Come on, Ling.

00:12:51.208 --> 00:12:52.048
Try wontons.

00:12:56.727 --> 00:12:58.328
The other day, Mr. Lu asked me

00:12:58.416 --> 00:12:59.664
if I wanted to participate

00:12:59.664 --> 00:13:00.624
in a showcase exhibition

00:13:00.624 --> 00:13:01.607
of Lawrence Art Gallery.

00:13:02.328 --> 00:13:04.487
What's a showcase exhibition?

00:13:05.208 --> 00:13:06.208
Ever had a fruit platter?

00:13:07.568 --> 00:13:08.607
A braised meat platter.

00:13:09.328 --> 00:13:11.527
It's like putting
similar things together.

00:13:11.527 --> 00:13:12.088
Mr. Changxi.

00:13:12.487 --> 00:13:13.288
It should be...

00:13:13.288 --> 00:13:14.288
a joint exhibition.

00:13:14.808 --> 00:13:16.247
That means gathering

00:13:16.247 --> 00:13:17.408
several talented sculptors

00:13:17.408 --> 00:13:18.048
in one place

00:13:18.048 --> 00:13:19.088
for a major exhibition.

00:13:19.168 --> 00:13:20.048
Exactly.

00:13:21.007 --> 00:13:22.048
If I were exceptional,

00:13:22.048 --> 00:13:23.088
I'd get a solo exhibition.

00:13:23.247 --> 00:13:24.928
It also means I need to work harder.

00:13:25.328 --> 00:13:26.007
Not at all.

00:13:26.127 --> 00:13:27.127
It's fine.

00:13:27.527 --> 00:13:30.367
You need energy to work harder, right?

00:13:31.088 --> 00:13:32.088
Eat up.

00:13:32.288 --> 00:13:33.127
Let's eat.

00:13:34.192 --> 00:13:37.424
(Joy Comes Upon)

00:13:49.168 --> 00:13:50.480
(Mr. Lu)

00:13:54.568 --> 00:13:55.127
Hello.

00:13:55.688 --> 00:13:57.487
Have you prepared
all the required documents?

00:13:59.647 --> 00:14:01.127
I was just about to tell you.

00:14:01.448 --> 00:14:02.607
Some of my pieces

00:14:02.607 --> 00:14:03.647
don't suit the exhibition.

00:14:04.247 --> 00:14:05.208
Stop it.

00:14:05.448 --> 00:14:06.408
It's a rare chance.

00:14:06.887 --> 00:14:08.168
It's just a joint exhibition,

00:14:08.328 --> 00:14:10.367
but every participating artist

00:14:10.408 --> 00:14:12.487
is a rising star gaining momentum.

00:14:13.247 --> 00:14:14.487
If you can't decide,

00:14:14.568 --> 00:14:16.168
I'll just send over a Hermit Duck piece.

00:14:20.808 --> 00:14:21.887
Give me some time.

00:14:21.887 --> 00:14:23.568
Staying low-key

00:14:23.968 --> 00:14:25.127
and following your whims

00:14:25.487 --> 00:14:26.127
will leave us

00:14:26.127 --> 00:14:28.007
struggling to make ends meet.

00:14:28.607 --> 00:14:30.088
After all, our talent has its limits.

00:14:30.568 --> 00:14:31.847
We need to face reality.

00:14:32.568 --> 00:14:33.767
Listen to me,

00:14:33.767 --> 00:14:34.647
you should...

00:14:55.928 --> 00:14:58.247
You've just recovered,

00:14:58.568 --> 00:15:00.048
so focus on internal wellness.

00:15:00.568 --> 00:15:02.527
Once your blood circulates smoothly,

00:15:02.727 --> 00:15:07.168
your internal organs like heart,
liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys

00:15:07.408 --> 00:15:10.487
can function properly.

00:15:11.288 --> 00:15:15.568
Next, drawing the bow.

00:15:18.068 --> 00:15:18.568
Mr. Changxi.

00:15:18.568 --> 00:15:20.088
I can't deal with this patience thing.

00:15:20.168 --> 00:15:22.048
These exercises are good
for you and Ms. Lu.

00:15:22.847 --> 00:15:24.887
Ling, how about I take you
for strength training?

00:15:25.328 --> 00:15:25.968
Me?

00:15:27.048 --> 00:15:28.048
All this stiff muscle

00:15:28.048 --> 00:15:29.808
is just for show.

00:15:30.288 --> 00:15:32.448
Nourishing yourself from the inside out

00:15:32.487 --> 00:15:34.928
is what truly benefits you.

00:15:35.367 --> 00:15:37.408
These are treasures
passed down by our ancestors.

00:15:37.408 --> 00:15:38.328
You understand nothing.

00:15:38.887 --> 00:15:39.928
Ling, don't listen to him.

00:15:39.928 --> 00:15:40.767
Follow my pace.

00:15:41.767 --> 00:15:42.408
Straighten up.

00:15:57.168 --> 00:15:58.007
What's the matter?

00:16:00.928 --> 00:16:01.928
Do you think

00:16:02.247 --> 00:16:03.928
I have any real talent

00:16:05.048 --> 00:16:06.127
on sculpting?

00:16:07.208 --> 00:16:08.328
What's wrong?

00:16:09.288 --> 00:16:10.088
Just asking.

00:16:12.288 --> 00:16:13.328
Is it because

00:16:13.527 --> 00:16:15.168
the showcase exhibition?

00:16:20.887 --> 00:16:22.887
If you don't want to go, then don't.

00:16:23.127 --> 00:16:24.408
You can't excel at everything.

00:16:24.847 --> 00:16:25.647
What do you mean?

00:16:26.288 --> 00:16:27.007
Look,

00:16:28.527 --> 00:16:31.127
you're beautiful and highly skilled,

00:16:31.408 --> 00:16:33.048
both smart and compassionate.

00:16:33.328 --> 00:16:34.928
Most importantly, you are discerning

00:16:35.007 --> 00:16:36.007
in judging people.

00:16:37.408 --> 00:16:38.048
Come on.

00:16:38.048 --> 00:16:39.288
Don't try to flatter me.

00:16:39.887 --> 00:16:41.127
I know my limits.

00:16:45.328 --> 00:16:46.767
Hard work pays off.

00:16:48.408 --> 00:16:49.288
Just work hard,

00:16:49.288 --> 00:16:50.448
and you'll obtain something.

00:16:50.887 --> 00:16:51.607
Look at me.

00:16:52.328 --> 00:16:53.727
I've been exercising daily lately.

00:16:53.727 --> 00:16:55.208
I'm almost fully recovered now.

00:16:56.007 --> 00:16:56.847
I even feel

00:16:56.847 --> 00:16:58.727
bodyweight workouts
aren't cutting it anymore.

00:16:58.767 --> 00:17:00.088
Any gyms around here?

00:17:00.208 --> 00:17:01.408
Take it easy.

00:17:01.568 --> 00:17:03.048
You just got recovered.

00:17:03.168 --> 00:17:04.287
Don't overestimate yourself.

00:17:05.928 --> 00:17:07.567
And back when we were kids,

00:17:07.688 --> 00:17:09.208
there were no gyms at all.

00:17:09.928 --> 00:17:11.247
We just used whatever was around.

00:17:12.047 --> 00:17:15.448
Like buckets, logs,

00:17:15.487 --> 00:17:17.608
stones, tires...

00:17:18.888 --> 00:17:19.648
Even

00:17:20.767 --> 00:17:21.487
training partners.

00:17:22.648 --> 00:17:23.368
Training partners?

00:17:34.567 --> 00:17:35.727
Three.

00:17:48.928 --> 00:17:50.567
When you do more than ten,

00:17:50.567 --> 00:17:51.888
I'll get you a gym membership.

00:17:51.928 --> 00:17:52.527
Wait.

00:17:52.807 --> 00:17:54.727
I can't keep my balance like this.

00:17:55.047 --> 00:17:56.527
Why copy the Ninja Duck?

00:17:56.767 --> 00:17:57.608
That doesn't count.

00:18:00.928 --> 00:18:01.567
Fine.

00:18:01.968 --> 00:18:02.688
It doesn't count.

00:18:06.128 --> 00:18:07.368
Can you keep your balance now?

00:18:12.487 --> 00:18:13.287
Four.

00:18:25.487 --> 00:18:26.087
Wait.

00:18:26.968 --> 00:18:29.327
You said you can't keep your balance.

00:18:29.327 --> 00:18:29.928
Wait.

00:18:30.047 --> 00:18:31.287
This one doesn't count either.

00:18:31.287 --> 00:18:32.368
I'm out of energy.

00:18:33.208 --> 00:18:35.168
So what would make it count?

00:18:48.327 --> 00:18:49.007
I...

00:18:51.247 --> 00:18:51.968
I want...

00:19:21.936 --> 00:19:23.408
(1 Message)

00:19:44.807 --> 00:19:45.928
The Earth Fiend replied.

00:19:58.168 --> 00:19:59.567
I tried to live

00:19:59.567 --> 00:20:02.567
among humans under rules and law,

00:20:02.928 --> 00:20:06.408
without offending
the South Mountain Hunters.

00:20:07.287 --> 00:20:10.848
But it was just my wild imagination
and wishful thinking.

00:20:11.527 --> 00:20:12.928
Even unwilling to do it,

00:20:13.567 --> 00:20:15.608
I must still do it.

00:20:17.287 --> 00:20:19.168
You can claim it a declaration of war,

00:20:19.608 --> 00:20:21.448
or just an invitation.

00:20:22.527 --> 00:20:23.807
Ten days from now,

00:20:23.888 --> 00:20:26.888
bring everyone you and I captured.

00:20:27.688 --> 00:20:29.848
Let's settle everything face-to-face.

00:20:30.368 --> 00:20:32.287
I've picked the location.

00:20:33.727 --> 00:20:36.448
The place where we first met,

00:20:37.727 --> 00:20:39.168
Twilight Chasm

00:20:39.767 --> 00:20:41.007
under the Golden Gate.

00:20:47.608 --> 00:20:49.688
Letting go of what I have

00:20:49.888 --> 00:20:51.688
does pain me deeply.

00:20:52.767 --> 00:20:54.527
But then again,

00:20:55.408 --> 00:20:56.807
what I've gained

00:20:57.767 --> 00:20:59.287
is more than enough.

00:21:00.287 --> 00:21:01.208
Besides,

00:21:02.168 --> 00:21:03.608
I have time.

00:21:04.567 --> 00:21:06.368
I have plenty of time.

00:21:07.688 --> 00:21:08.888
I can afford to wait

00:21:09.567 --> 00:21:11.007
and to waste.

00:21:13.007 --> 00:21:15.608
I remember every one of you,

00:21:16.087 --> 00:21:20.247
your families and descendants.

00:21:21.047 --> 00:21:24.888
I'll keep caring for them in your stead.

00:21:25.968 --> 00:21:28.168
So go all out

00:21:28.487 --> 00:21:31.247
and fulfill
your South Mountain Hunters duties.

00:21:32.247 --> 00:21:33.128
Tuo.

00:21:34.368 --> 00:21:35.928
I bet you hear this too.

00:21:37.247 --> 00:21:38.688
I've told you many

00:21:38.688 --> 00:21:40.327
sincere words.

00:21:40.807 --> 00:21:42.928
I bet you heard them all.

00:21:45.287 --> 00:21:47.807
Your father would be thrilled

00:21:47.807 --> 00:21:49.888
if he knew his mine

00:21:50.487 --> 00:21:52.208
became Roadsound Group.

00:21:53.648 --> 00:21:55.807
Your mother attempted to kill me.

00:21:56.888 --> 00:21:58.648
I even gave her a chance,

00:21:59.168 --> 00:22:00.888
but she just missed it.

00:22:01.767 --> 00:22:04.767
You shouldn't have survived.

00:22:05.327 --> 00:22:06.807
I raised you

00:22:06.807 --> 00:22:08.247
to a grown man.

00:22:09.007 --> 00:22:11.408
Your whole family owes me gratitude.

00:22:12.567 --> 00:22:15.247
The little snake I nurtured
has grown fangs

00:22:15.807 --> 00:22:17.168
and tries to slip away.

00:22:18.208 --> 00:22:20.487
I know I can't keep you.

00:22:21.848 --> 00:22:23.448
I know

00:22:24.047 --> 00:22:25.208
you'd leave me.

00:22:26.287 --> 00:22:28.888
But you bit me
with your poisonous fangs,

00:22:30.128 --> 00:22:34.007
which marks you
as disloyal and ungrateful.

00:22:36.168 --> 00:22:37.968
Since you're this heartless,

00:22:38.767 --> 00:22:42.368
you clearly don't care
about Yan Xin anymore.

00:22:43.527 --> 00:22:46.648
This time, I'll bring her
to Twilight Chasm.

00:22:47.408 --> 00:22:48.608
Along with Jiang Baichuan

00:22:48.608 --> 00:22:51.287
and those South Mountain Hunters.

00:22:51.848 --> 00:22:55.168
Let my long-imprisoned kindred

00:22:55.888 --> 00:22:57.487
have a feast.

00:22:59.727 --> 00:23:01.648
I wish to see you

00:23:01.807 --> 00:23:04.487
and my old friends
from South Mountain again.

00:23:04.968 --> 00:23:06.208
If fate doesn't grant me,

00:23:07.368 --> 00:23:09.208
consider this our farewell.

00:23:35.368 --> 00:23:36.208
For so long now,

00:23:37.287 --> 00:23:38.448
there's been no sign

00:23:38.448 --> 00:23:39.727
Yan Xin is in her grasp.

00:23:40.208 --> 00:23:41.527
Her bringing it up now

00:23:41.767 --> 00:23:42.807
is just a bait.

00:23:46.767 --> 00:23:48.408
Jiang and those South Mountain Hunters

00:23:48.807 --> 00:23:50.968
were also just bait to lure you out.

00:23:55.047 --> 00:23:55.928
This time,

00:23:59.047 --> 00:24:01.408
it's far more than
a simple hostage swap or trade.

00:24:04.727 --> 00:24:06.087
It's time to end everything.

00:24:09.007 --> 00:24:10.208
Not just for me,

00:24:11.608 --> 00:24:12.448
but also for you.

00:24:30.168 --> 00:24:32.247
(Burn After Reading: Heard the recording.
Both Yan Tuo and I will be there.)

00:24:38.168 --> 00:24:40.408
She wants us to go to her lair?

00:24:41.208 --> 00:24:42.527
This is simply a trap.

00:24:43.368 --> 00:24:45.487
Maybe it's an act out of desperation.

00:24:46.208 --> 00:24:48.287
Perfect. We could
wipe them out in one go.

00:24:50.007 --> 00:24:51.408
A cornered rabbit will also bite.

00:24:52.087 --> 00:24:53.208
A wounded beast,

00:24:53.648 --> 00:24:54.888
seeming abandoned,

00:24:55.327 --> 00:24:56.408
is the most dangerous.

00:24:57.848 --> 00:24:58.567
Especially

00:24:58.567 --> 00:25:00.527
a female carnivore
who's just lost her cub.

00:25:00.928 --> 00:25:01.727
Best be careful.

00:25:02.368 --> 00:25:04.047
Mad Blade has said

00:25:04.168 --> 00:25:05.567
she'll go to Twilight Chasm.

00:25:05.688 --> 00:25:06.767
What are we waiting for?

00:25:07.128 --> 00:25:08.128
Go rendezvous with her.

00:25:08.767 --> 00:25:09.368
Let's go.

00:25:11.208 --> 00:25:11.968
To rescue Jiang,

00:25:12.128 --> 00:25:12.888
count me in.

00:25:14.007 --> 00:25:14.567
Hey.

00:25:14.688 --> 00:25:15.688
Don't be ridiculous.

00:25:22.192 --> 00:25:23.312
(Roadsound Group)

00:25:30.608 --> 00:25:31.608
We have to go

00:25:32.727 --> 00:25:33.487
to Twilight Chasm.

00:25:34.928 --> 00:25:37.848
But we can't go unprepared.

00:25:39.128 --> 00:25:40.648
Our top priority is rescuing our men.

00:25:41.408 --> 00:25:43.128
First, rescue Jiang and others.

00:25:43.727 --> 00:25:45.807
Then we take them all out,
leaving none alive.

00:25:46.527 --> 00:25:48.648
The Youtang Mine is their escape route.

00:25:49.727 --> 00:25:51.327
We must seal it off completely.

00:25:52.208 --> 00:25:53.727
They may have the terrain advantage,

00:25:54.567 --> 00:25:55.767
but their numbers are limited.

00:25:57.168 --> 00:25:58.368
We're not exactly strangers

00:25:59.007 --> 00:26:00.408
to the Golden Gate area.

00:26:01.448 --> 00:26:02.807
We may still hold some advantage.

00:26:04.928 --> 00:26:05.727
Moreover,

00:26:07.287 --> 00:26:09.128
we might have other helpers too.

00:26:11.487 --> 00:26:12.408
You mean,

00:26:13.448 --> 00:26:15.208
helpers besides Mad Blade?

00:26:19.368 --> 00:26:20.287
As usual.

00:26:21.208 --> 00:26:22.287
Vote by raising hands.

00:26:22.968 --> 00:26:24.287
Accept Lin Xirou's invitation,

00:26:24.688 --> 00:26:27.047
open the Golden Gate
and go to Twilight Chasm.

00:27:04.168 --> 00:27:04.807
Shen,

00:27:07.888 --> 00:27:09.168
you plan

00:27:09.368 --> 00:27:11.807
to let Yu Rong lead a team
to seal the Youtang mine?

00:27:14.888 --> 00:27:17.087
She has been there and knows the place.

00:27:18.047 --> 00:27:18.848
In my opinion,

00:27:18.896 --> 00:27:21.840
with Mad Dog, Ghost Whip, and Mad Blade
united at the Golden Gate,

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:23.216
cracking down the Twilight Chasm,

00:27:23.368 --> 00:27:25.208
that's the true spirit of the Hunters.

00:27:25.968 --> 00:27:28.208
I'm just worried
it'll end up like the last time.

00:27:28.208 --> 00:27:29.087
Spread power too thin.

00:27:30.767 --> 00:27:31.688
What do you suggest?

00:27:34.087 --> 00:27:35.287
I'll go to seal the mine.

00:27:38.567 --> 00:27:40.487
My family has been
the Hunters for generations.

00:27:41.087 --> 00:27:42.608
I've been trained since childhood.

00:27:43.168 --> 00:27:44.448
When I got tired from training,

00:27:44.688 --> 00:27:45.767
my father would say,

00:27:46.087 --> 00:27:47.767
"You can play the hero
whenever you want."

00:27:47.968 --> 00:27:49.688
"But never chicken out
at the key moment."

00:27:50.487 --> 00:27:51.247
This time,

00:27:51.247 --> 00:27:52.567
let me play the hero.

00:27:55.888 --> 00:27:57.408
Once entering the Twilight Chasm,

00:27:59.007 --> 00:28:00.527
fiends hunt human monsters.

00:28:04.208 --> 00:28:06.047
Blades and hounds
walk the Turquoise Land,

00:28:07.168 --> 00:28:09.208
and Ghost Whip cracks his glowing whip.

00:28:11.648 --> 00:28:13.408
Seven hounds, two whips, and one blade.

00:28:14.247 --> 00:28:14.848
Okay.

00:28:15.208 --> 00:28:16.928
The Golden Gate
is fortified beyond defeat.

00:28:16.928 --> 00:28:18.888
I'll assign two experienced men

00:28:20.007 --> 00:28:20.888
to join you.

00:28:27.608 --> 00:28:30.767
South Mountain shall see
no more unjust deaths.

00:28:35.928 --> 00:28:36.487
Come on.

00:28:36.487 --> 00:28:37.968
Start eating. Don't wait for me.

00:28:38.007 --> 00:28:39.208
One more dish is almost ready.

00:28:39.767 --> 00:28:40.527
Mr. Changxi,

00:28:40.888 --> 00:28:42.368
you and Ms. Lu are

00:28:42.368 --> 00:28:43.928
fattening us all up.

00:28:44.727 --> 00:28:45.767
Just let him stay busy.

00:28:45.767 --> 00:28:46.527
He can't sit idly.

00:28:46.527 --> 00:28:48.128
He even suggested me to join him

00:28:48.128 --> 00:28:49.648
to dig wild herbs in the mountain.

00:28:50.087 --> 00:28:52.408
Spring Special for Changxi Dumplings.

00:28:52.527 --> 00:28:54.448
Shepherd's purse filling, super fresh.

00:28:54.968 --> 00:28:55.567
Mr. Changxi.

00:28:56.208 --> 00:28:58.168
Luo and I are going on a long trip.

00:28:58.168 --> 00:28:59.608
Make those when we come back.

00:29:01.368 --> 00:29:02.848
Where are you going?

00:29:04.608 --> 00:29:05.888
To get artistic inspiration.

00:29:06.128 --> 00:29:07.807
But we plan to visit several places.

00:29:10.408 --> 00:29:11.128
Mr. Changxi,

00:29:11.727 --> 00:29:13.688
when we're not around,

00:29:13.688 --> 00:29:15.440
hone your cooking skills with Ms. Lu.

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:17.888
When we return,
let's see if Lin Ling has gained weight.

00:29:17.968 --> 00:29:19.047
If she hasn't,

00:29:19.128 --> 00:29:20.608
it means you still need to practice.

00:29:20.928 --> 00:29:21.848
Deal.

00:29:22.287 --> 00:29:23.007
This time,

00:29:23.007 --> 00:29:25.047
I'll definitely learn properly

00:29:25.047 --> 00:29:26.807
how you make that filling.

00:29:27.087 --> 00:29:27.807
Alright.

00:29:27.807 --> 00:29:28.727
Teach you everything.

00:29:29.368 --> 00:29:30.408
Eat up.

00:29:34.007 --> 00:29:34.727
Let's eat.

00:29:37.007 --> 00:29:37.688
Come on.

00:29:37.727 --> 00:29:38.608
Teach you everything.

00:29:55.327 --> 00:29:56.128
What's wrong?

00:29:57.567 --> 00:29:58.968
Don't just sit right after eating.

00:30:01.007 --> 00:30:02.287
Take a stroll after the meal.

00:30:02.287 --> 00:30:03.608
That's how you can live long.

00:30:03.727 --> 00:30:04.408
Understood?

00:30:08.527 --> 00:30:09.128
Tuo.

00:30:11.487 --> 00:30:12.727
Getting artistic inspiration

00:30:14.007 --> 00:30:15.287
was just a lie, right?

00:30:26.688 --> 00:30:28.247
We must end this.

00:30:30.888 --> 00:30:31.688
To Luo,

00:30:33.087 --> 00:30:33.888
to me.

00:30:35.247 --> 00:30:36.928
And it goes the same to you.

00:30:42.128 --> 00:30:44.047
We finally escaped

00:30:46.247 --> 00:30:47.928
and found peace.

00:30:50.888 --> 00:30:51.848
But this peace

00:30:51.848 --> 00:30:53.047
is only temporary.

00:30:54.888 --> 00:30:56.727
If we must hide

00:30:56.848 --> 00:30:58.648
and run in fear,

00:31:00.408 --> 00:31:01.848
then what's the difference between

00:31:02.168 --> 00:31:03.767
the current life and the previous one?

00:31:07.408 --> 00:31:09.247
I'd rather return to the previous life

00:31:10.208 --> 00:31:11.688
than see you get harmed.

00:31:18.968 --> 00:31:19.608
I swear,

00:31:20.567 --> 00:31:21.767
we'll come back safe.

00:31:22.368 --> 00:31:23.007
Okay?

00:31:25.368 --> 00:31:26.007
Don't worry.

00:31:35.952 --> 00:31:39.984
(Moving Forward)

00:32:10.888 --> 00:32:11.648
This time,

00:32:11.648 --> 00:32:13.767
many South Mountain Hunters
are going with us.

00:32:14.168 --> 00:32:14.688
We'll take

00:32:14.688 --> 00:32:16.688
the path we've trodden
countless times before.

00:32:16.688 --> 00:32:17.487
Don't worry.

00:32:18.047 --> 00:32:19.968
You must keep me updated.

00:32:20.688 --> 00:32:21.567
Got it.

00:32:23.727 --> 00:32:24.848
When you two are not around,

00:32:25.208 --> 00:32:26.087
with me alone here,

00:32:26.087 --> 00:32:27.767
I don't know what to do.

00:32:29.327 --> 00:32:30.608
You can enter my room anytime.

00:32:30.767 --> 00:32:32.968
To read, paint, daydream,
or play with clay.

00:32:32.968 --> 00:32:33.888
Do whatever you like.

00:32:36.527 --> 00:32:38.087
I'm worried about you,

00:32:38.527 --> 00:32:40.688
but honestly, I really envy you.

00:32:41.648 --> 00:32:44.208
Envy that you always know your goals,

00:32:44.767 --> 00:32:46.247
and keep pursuing them.

00:32:52.767 --> 00:32:53.807
You're still young.

00:32:54.168 --> 00:32:55.487
Have time to chase your dreams.

00:33:00.047 --> 00:33:00.888
Promise me

00:33:01.287 --> 00:33:02.527
to come back safe.

00:33:04.648 --> 00:33:05.247
Sure.

00:33:06.287 --> 00:33:06.968
See?

00:33:07.287 --> 00:33:08.247
Good things ahead.

00:33:13.087 --> 00:33:13.688
Let's go.

00:33:15.007 --> 00:33:16.047
I'll walk you out.

00:33:16.208 --> 00:33:17.047
Okay, I'll get it.

00:33:25.744 --> 00:33:31.952
(Nanshan Rescue Team)

00:33:42.224 --> 00:33:46.832
(Entrusted by All, Aid from All Sides)

00:33:51.168 --> 00:33:52.247
Don't forget the gear.

00:33:53.327 --> 00:33:54.168
Take this too.

00:34:25.808 --> 00:34:27.408
Our ancestors battled in Turquoise Land,

00:34:28.487 --> 00:34:29.968
assailed by Earth Fiends.

00:34:31.664 --> 00:34:33.712
The ancient king founded
the South Mountain Hunters

00:34:34.007 --> 00:34:35.288
to fight the fiends unto death.

00:34:35.808 --> 00:34:37.047
We inherit this duty.

00:34:38.288 --> 00:34:39.888
Now Earth Fiends invade again.

00:34:40.968 --> 00:34:42.408
We summon the Hunter King Cauldron

00:34:43.248 --> 00:34:45.848
to pray ancestors and protect the realm.

00:34:47.408 --> 00:34:50.888
May South Mountain purge the fiends
and bring peace to the people.

00:34:51.216 --> 00:34:53.007
- May South Mountain purge the fiends
- May South Mountain purge the fiends

00:34:53.007 --> 00:34:54.832

00:35:04.888 --> 00:35:07.768
Mad Dog bays, thunderous roar.

00:35:08.047 --> 00:35:09.368
Iron hammers shatter fiend teeth.

00:35:10.527 --> 00:35:13.456
- Mad Dog bays, thunderous roar.

Copper coils bind fiendish hearts.

- Ghost Whip cracks, swifter than wind.

Ms. Lin.

00:37:20.368 --> 00:37:21.368
I thought

00:37:23.728 --> 00:37:25.288
you had forgotten me.

00:37:26.248 --> 00:37:27.607
This is the last chance.

00:37:28.487 --> 00:37:29.647
Where is the Mad Blade?

00:37:31.007 --> 00:37:32.007
If I'd tell you,

00:37:34.328 --> 00:37:35.607
I would've told you long ago.

00:37:36.408 --> 00:37:40.087
Why suffer such pain

00:37:40.087 --> 00:37:41.567
and hang in till now?

00:37:42.607 --> 00:37:43.207
Fine.

00:37:49.007 --> 00:37:50.167
Then, there's

00:37:50.968 --> 00:37:52.448
no need to tell me anymore.

00:37:54.007 --> 00:37:54.647
Ms. Lin.

00:38:00.328 --> 00:38:01.288
If we kill him now,

00:38:01.728 --> 00:38:03.448
we'd lose an important bargaining chip.

00:38:07.087 --> 00:38:08.848
Do you think I would

00:38:08.848 --> 00:38:10.207
let him off that easily?
