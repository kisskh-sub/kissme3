Hurry!

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.944
Sir.

00:01:30.028 --> 00:01:33.156
-Sir, please stop that person!
-Are you An Yun-su?

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:34.908
-Stop that black hoodie!
-Calm down.

00:01:34.991 --> 00:01:37.452
-No, that person!
-Ms. An, it's not that…

00:01:37.535 --> 00:01:39.579
Please stop that person
in the black hoodie!

00:01:39.662 --> 00:01:40.788
-No, not me!
-Calm down.

00:01:40.872 --> 00:01:43.458
You have to stop that person!
Let go of me!

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:48.713
You have to stop them.

00:01:49.797 --> 00:01:51.633
That person killed my husband.

00:01:59.515 --> 00:02:01.351
Hurry up. Move it!

00:02:01.434 --> 00:02:02.310
Hurry up!

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.145
Get a move on!

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.355
Come on!

00:02:05.438 --> 00:02:06.981
Face the wall!

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:09.901
-Stand up straight.
-Move!

00:02:09.984 --> 00:02:11.069
Face the wall.

00:02:11.152 --> 00:02:13.655
Line up outside in single file. Move it!

00:02:14.781 --> 00:02:16.616
-Hurry up.
-In single file!

00:02:19.994 --> 00:02:20.912
Face the wall.

00:02:22.288 --> 00:02:23.122
-Count off.
-One.

00:02:23.206 --> 00:02:24.499
-Two.
-Three.

00:02:24.582 --> 00:02:25.708
-Four.
-Five.

00:02:25.792 --> 00:02:27.794
Get out here now!

00:02:28.294 --> 00:02:29.504
Inmate 1605!

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:32.090
Inmate 1605!

00:02:33.341 --> 00:02:34.425
What?

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:35.843
Get up. Outside, now.

00:02:43.476 --> 00:02:44.394
Check there.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.831
Nothing's been recorded
because of a server error.

00:03:04.914 --> 00:03:06.457
Who had afternoon solitary duty?

00:03:07.792 --> 00:03:10.586
Officer Jung. She's gone home,
and I can't get ahold of her.

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:12.297
Are you kidding me?

DETECTIVE RYU JI-SU

Baek Dong-hun speaking.

00:04:03.556 --> 00:04:08.061
This is Ryu Ji-su.
There seems to be an issue with An Yun-su.

00:04:08.895 --> 00:04:11.689
She violated probation and left her house.

00:04:11.773 --> 00:04:14.609
She says someone came into her yard,
so she went after them.

MO EUN MISSING FROM DETENTION
AS OF 10:30 P.M.

00:04:23.451 --> 00:04:25.328
Hello, Officer Bae. Yes.

00:04:31.042 --> 00:04:32.085
Is she badly hurt?

00:04:33.878 --> 00:04:36.172
No, I'll be right there. Okay.

00:04:36.672 --> 00:04:37.507
Okay.

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.135
Mr. Jang, you need to stop by
Ms. An's place first.

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:44.639
She said she left Sop at home.

00:04:44.722 --> 00:04:47.141
Some officers have gone there,

00:04:47.225 --> 00:04:50.311
but she says Sop will be scared of them.

00:04:55.733 --> 00:04:56.567
Damn it.

00:04:58.027 --> 00:04:59.112
Who are you, sir?

00:04:59.195 --> 00:05:01.364
-I'm An Yun-su's attorney.
-Hold on a second.

00:05:01.447 --> 00:05:02.532
You're her attorney?

00:05:06.035 --> 00:05:08.830
Turn off the flashing lights.
You want to wake everyone up?

00:05:08.913 --> 00:05:11.040
It's okay. We're going to Mommy.

00:05:11.124 --> 00:05:12.458
It's okay. I hear you.

00:05:13.334 --> 00:05:14.627
Turn them off now!

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.045
I'll take you to Mommy.

00:05:16.546 --> 00:05:17.422
Hey, Sop.

00:05:17.922 --> 00:05:18.756
Sop, it's me.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.133
You're okay. I'll take her.

00:05:20.216 --> 00:05:23.886
I've got her. Hey, Sop. It's me.

00:05:25.012 --> 00:05:25.847
Scary, wasn't it?

00:05:26.973 --> 00:05:29.100
Check the detention center CCTVs,

00:05:29.183 --> 00:05:31.185
and track Mo Eun's exact movements.

00:05:31.269 --> 00:05:32.103
Yes.

00:05:43.406 --> 00:05:46.617
I've heard what happened
and get that you had a hard time.

00:05:46.701 --> 00:05:51.289
But as per procedure, it's our job
to handle probation violations.

00:05:51.372 --> 00:05:52.331
I'm afraid you can't.

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:54.959
We'll write her up and book her in

00:05:55.042 --> 00:05:58.504
for obstruction of justice
and assaulting an officer.

00:05:59.005 --> 00:06:02.425
You see, this isn't that simple.

00:06:02.925 --> 00:06:05.136
A single report from you…

00:06:09.974 --> 00:06:12.393
could completely ruin a person's life.

00:06:14.103 --> 00:06:16.397
Are you trying to scare me off? Huh?

00:06:16.898 --> 00:06:17.940
So what?

00:06:18.024 --> 00:06:21.694
You want to cover up a clear offense
out of sympathy? Is that it?

00:06:21.777 --> 00:06:23.154
I don't mean cover it up.

00:06:23.237 --> 00:06:26.908
I mean, we should review this
rationally and carefully.

00:06:26.991 --> 00:06:29.160
You've got to be kidding me.

00:06:32.955 --> 00:06:35.249
I told you to watch the kid,
not bring her here!

00:06:35.333 --> 00:06:37.585
Keep it down, will you?
You'll wake her up.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.926
-Why did you bring Sop all the way here?
-She's only just stopped crying.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.804
Could you get me out of these?

00:06:50.806 --> 00:06:52.308
Please uncuff her.

00:06:53.059 --> 00:06:55.353
She's not going to run
when her kid is right here.

00:06:55.937 --> 00:06:58.773
-And who might you be?
-He's Ms. An's attorney.

00:07:01.108 --> 00:07:01.943
Is that true?

00:07:02.026 --> 00:07:02.985
Yes, sir.

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:06.781
Uncuff her.

00:07:07.281 --> 00:07:08.115
Yes, sir.

00:07:17.166 --> 00:07:18.292
I'll be back soon.

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:24.048
You can talk to me from now on.

00:07:24.632 --> 00:07:25.967
Sure. Why not?

00:07:35.851 --> 00:07:38.813
You can see her pushing
and assaulting the police, can't you?

00:07:38.896 --> 00:07:41.566
No, not me! You have to stop that person!

00:07:41.649 --> 00:07:42.608
No…

00:07:42.692 --> 00:07:45.361
No, let me go.
Just let me go, for God's sake!

00:07:46.153 --> 00:07:47.280
Oh my.

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:48.990
You have to stop them.

00:07:52.827 --> 00:07:53.995
As you can see,

00:07:54.495 --> 00:07:56.914
we were following procedure
in making the arrest.

00:07:56.998 --> 00:07:58.749
That's a fact.

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:00.585
"A fact"?

00:08:01.669 --> 00:08:03.421
There were several officers,

00:08:03.921 --> 00:08:06.048
yet you're accusing
an injured woman of assault?

00:08:06.132 --> 00:08:09.760
She was going wild, charging at us.
What were we supposed to do?

00:08:10.303 --> 00:08:12.179
That'll be up for debate in due time.

00:08:12.722 --> 00:08:14.473
What I really don't understand

00:08:14.557 --> 00:08:18.269
is why no one heard
what my client was saying.

00:08:18.894 --> 00:08:19.770
Look,

00:08:20.271 --> 00:08:22.315
we went there to arrest her,

00:08:22.398 --> 00:08:24.442
not to listen to some story.

00:08:24.525 --> 00:08:26.319
Are you saying you chose to ignore her?

00:08:26.902 --> 00:08:30.781
She's wearing an ankle monitor,
accused of murdering her husband.

00:08:30.865 --> 00:08:34.035
Why should we listen to someone like her?
For what reason?

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.166
Sergeant,

00:08:40.249 --> 00:08:44.420
can you write down what you just said
in your report word for word?

00:08:45.796 --> 00:08:48.341
Why would I do that? Huh?

00:08:48.424 --> 00:08:50.593
That's confirmation bias on your part.

00:08:51.093 --> 00:08:52.762
You were just going to arrest her

00:08:52.845 --> 00:08:54.847
without fully investigating, weren't you?

00:08:57.099 --> 00:08:59.143
-Now, come on.
-Excuse me.

00:09:05.191 --> 00:09:06.525
What's this?

00:09:07.443 --> 00:09:09.779
I found what the police missed.

00:09:22.083 --> 00:09:24.043
She said someone was in her yard.

00:09:24.126 --> 00:09:26.796
She ran out to go after the person
peeking into her house.

00:09:26.879 --> 00:09:29.006
But the police won't hear her out.

00:09:31.008 --> 00:09:33.386
-So you need proof.
-Yes.

00:09:34.387 --> 00:09:35.304
I'll find it.

00:09:35.388 --> 00:09:37.973
You should go to Ms. An.

00:09:55.783 --> 00:09:57.326
It's clear there was an intruder

00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:00.329
and that she ran after them.

00:10:01.038 --> 00:10:04.500
Her clash with the police will be seen
as self-defense, not intentional.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:05.876
What do you think?

00:10:06.377 --> 00:10:07.503
If this goes to court,

00:10:07.586 --> 00:10:10.005
the police will be exposed
for dereliction of duty.

00:10:10.089 --> 00:10:14.093
Shall we reveal this and hear
what the court and the public have to say?

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:17.138
Well, I mean…

00:10:19.056 --> 00:10:21.267
It's not even under our jurisdiction,

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:24.270
so you can take her
and file the report yourself.

00:10:25.896 --> 00:10:28.065
Come on, don't look at me like that.

00:10:28.149 --> 00:10:31.360
To be honest,
we were just there as backup.

00:10:31.444 --> 00:10:32.528
Exactly.

00:10:32.611 --> 00:10:36.907
I'm finding it a little awkward
that you've ended up in a sticky situation

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:38.993
after all that trouble.

00:10:40.244 --> 00:10:42.163
Well, I'll leave you to it, then.

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:46.208
Take this with you, sir!

00:10:47.334 --> 00:10:48.335
Is that ours?

00:10:54.675 --> 00:10:55.676
Wow.

00:10:56.886 --> 00:10:59.346
My anklet is so much prettier now.

00:11:00.931 --> 00:11:02.016
Thank you.

00:11:05.394 --> 00:11:06.228
Here too.

00:11:08.939 --> 00:11:10.816
I love it.

00:11:14.904 --> 00:11:15.988
How did it go?

00:11:16.489 --> 00:11:17.615
It worked out well.

00:11:17.698 --> 00:11:19.742
You can go home in a few days.

00:11:19.825 --> 00:11:21.327
By "well," what do you…

00:11:22.536 --> 00:11:23.913
What happened today

00:11:24.413 --> 00:11:26.582
will be reported to the court.

00:11:28.417 --> 00:11:32.630
We'll have to see whether the judge
will grant you mitigation.

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:34.507
I'm sure they will.

00:11:35.007 --> 00:11:37.593
You'll do a good job writing the report,
won't you?

00:11:38.093 --> 00:11:38.969
I will?

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:43.557
But I'm just going to report it
as it happened.

00:11:43.641 --> 00:11:46.060
That's all we need.
Just the facts, as they are.

00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:48.521
That's what we want.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:50.815
Yeah.

00:11:54.109 --> 00:11:57.112
I'll postpone our meeting next week.

00:11:57.196 --> 00:12:00.991
You can come to my office
once you're home and feeling better.

00:12:01.075 --> 00:12:02.910
No, I'll come as scheduled.

00:12:02.993 --> 00:12:05.746
Can we go home now?

00:12:06.622 --> 00:12:07.623
Sop, let's go.

00:12:08.249 --> 00:12:09.542
Will you be okay?

00:12:10.167 --> 00:12:11.377
Yes, I'll be fine.

00:12:16.841 --> 00:12:20.511
Neurosurgeon to Ward 7, please.

00:12:20.594 --> 00:12:23.722
Neurosurgeon to Ward 7, please.

00:12:23.806 --> 00:12:25.015
For God's sake.

00:12:28.143 --> 00:12:30.437
Hi! You must be Sop.

00:12:31.522 --> 00:12:34.608
Do you like chocolate milk?
Why don't we have some over there?

00:12:34.692 --> 00:12:36.735
No, Sop. You shouldn't follow strangers.

00:12:44.618 --> 00:12:45.619
Ms. An.

00:12:49.915 --> 00:12:52.209
MO EUN MISSING FROM DETENTION
AS OF 10:30 P.M.

00:12:52.293 --> 00:12:53.586
Who were you after?

00:13:04.722 --> 00:13:05.723
Who was it?

00:13:07.516 --> 00:13:09.310
It's your job to find out.

00:13:09.393 --> 00:13:10.477
That's why I'm asking

00:13:11.186 --> 00:13:13.105
who you thought you were after.

00:13:13.188 --> 00:13:15.983
Someone sneaked into her yard
and peeked into her house.

00:13:16.609 --> 00:13:18.235
Someone in a black hoodie.

00:13:18.861 --> 00:13:20.487
What more do you need?

00:13:21.405 --> 00:13:25.034
She's the victim here.
Why are you always accusing her?

00:13:27.077 --> 00:13:28.037
Let's go, Sop.

00:13:30.873 --> 00:13:31.707
Come on.

00:13:37.588 --> 00:13:40.007
DAEUN HOSPITAL

00:13:42.718 --> 00:13:43.928
It's on the flash drive.

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:45.346
Thanks.

00:13:51.602 --> 00:13:53.103
The officers' dashcam footage.

00:13:56.231 --> 00:13:58.776
You've already heard
that they found Mo Eun.

00:14:00.152 --> 00:14:01.528
So what was that for?

00:14:03.364 --> 00:14:05.616
I wanted to see
the look on An Yun-su's face

00:14:06.742 --> 00:14:11.038
and see how tight the chokehold is that
Mo Eun has on her out here from in prison.

00:14:12.748 --> 00:14:13.582
That's what.

00:14:27.846 --> 00:14:28.889
Doctor!

00:14:43.696 --> 00:14:47.491
She went into shock from a spider bite
and was rushed in.

00:14:47.992 --> 00:14:50.619
I gave her medicine to calm her down
and put her to sleep.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.204
How long has it been?

00:14:52.871 --> 00:14:54.498
About three hours since she took--

00:14:54.581 --> 00:14:55.791
No,

00:14:56.667 --> 00:14:57.584
since you dozed off.

00:14:58.836 --> 00:14:59.670
Oh, me?

00:15:00.587 --> 00:15:03.382
I just nodded off for a bit
after staying up all night.

00:15:03.966 --> 00:15:05.968
Have I done something wrong?

00:15:08.762 --> 00:15:10.180
She was taken to the infirmary,

00:15:10.264 --> 00:15:12.933
but the guards forgot to log it
during the shift change.

00:15:13.017 --> 00:15:14.852
These things happen from time to time.

00:15:14.935 --> 00:15:16.812
By the way,

00:15:17.312 --> 00:15:19.148
during the time Mo Eun went missing,

00:15:19.231 --> 00:15:23.110
the cameras that would've captured her
weren't working, coincidentally.

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:25.904
Nothing was recorded
due to a server error.

00:15:25.988 --> 00:15:29.033
Do you think something might've happened
during that time?

00:15:29.116 --> 00:15:33.078
According to Ms. Eom,
nothing else was out of the ordinary.

00:15:33.162 --> 00:15:35.289
I felt it wasn't my place to keep prying.

00:15:35.956 --> 00:15:37.875
I see. Thank you for everything.

00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:39.585
It was you who took the trouble.

00:15:39.668 --> 00:15:42.838
And please tell Ms. An
not to worry too much.

00:15:42.921 --> 00:15:44.089
I will.

00:16:32.971 --> 00:16:34.264
How did you do it?

00:16:36.767 --> 00:16:38.102
Was it really you?

00:16:38.769 --> 00:16:40.687
Or did you get someone else to do it?

00:16:44.149 --> 00:16:46.193
I'll only believe what I've seen.

00:16:47.694 --> 00:16:49.488
What I've seen with my own eyes.

00:16:57.204 --> 00:16:58.872
By the way,

00:16:59.998 --> 00:17:03.293
even if you get out,
don't get any funny ideas.

00:17:04.837 --> 00:17:07.131
Wherever you are or whatever you're doing,

00:17:07.881 --> 00:17:10.050
I'll always be watching you.

00:17:12.386 --> 00:17:15.013
I'm putting an expiration date
on our deal.

00:17:16.265 --> 00:17:18.433
You have to kill him

00:17:19.518 --> 00:17:21.186
before your appeal.

00:17:22.146 --> 00:17:24.898
If you miss the deadline
because you hesitate,

00:17:25.774 --> 00:17:29.403
I'll retract my confession
on the witness stand at your trial.

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:32.990
Then you will return to this place

00:17:33.073 --> 00:17:34.992
under the world's critical gaze.

00:17:36.076 --> 00:17:40.414
And your daughter will end up alone,
resenting you for the rest of her life.

00:18:02.144 --> 00:18:03.604
There's only one way

00:18:03.687 --> 00:18:06.940
for you to clear your name
and be with your daughter.

00:18:08.775 --> 00:18:11.278
How the hell did you do it?

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:19.953
Isn't it ironic?

00:18:21.455 --> 00:18:23.874
That you actually have to commit a murder

00:18:24.374 --> 00:18:26.668
to clear yourself of a murder charge.

00:18:28.128 --> 00:18:29.963
Still, when it comes to mothers,

00:18:30.714 --> 00:18:35.427
they say they'll do anything
for their child, don't they?

00:18:36.887 --> 00:18:38.430
What about you?

00:18:40.474 --> 00:18:41.516
Do you think

00:18:42.601 --> 00:18:44.353
you can kill that kid?

00:18:55.697 --> 00:18:58.075
Inmate 407,
you're moving to the shared cell.

00:18:59.159 --> 00:19:03.705
The other inmates are whispering
that the Witch used magic last night.

00:19:05.791 --> 00:19:08.293
Only you seem untouched
by all the chaos you created.

00:19:08.377 --> 00:19:11.463
I slept like a baby for once,
thanks to the infirmary meds.

00:19:14.258 --> 00:19:17.719
We're moving you to the shared cell
at your attorney's request.

00:19:18.679 --> 00:19:20.430
But will you be okay around others?

00:19:22.182 --> 00:19:23.642
Are you worried

00:19:24.226 --> 00:19:25.769
about me?

00:19:26.853 --> 00:19:28.563
Or the others?

00:19:29.856 --> 00:19:30.691
Both.

00:19:32.734 --> 00:19:33.735
I see.

00:19:57.301 --> 00:19:59.511
I'm Mo Eun. Hope we get along.

00:20:01.972 --> 00:20:03.974
Here. Over here.

00:20:04.474 --> 00:20:08.061
You can use this locker. She just moved
to another cell this morning.

00:20:16.737 --> 00:20:17.738
Hey.

00:20:18.322 --> 00:20:20.032
We've met before, right?

00:20:20.115 --> 00:20:21.199
In the yard.

00:20:22.743 --> 00:20:24.369
You can call me Pudgy.

00:20:30.542 --> 00:20:32.294
Are you on a fucking blind date?

00:20:32.377 --> 00:20:35.964
What's with all the goddamn introductions?
Who the hell is it?

00:20:36.048 --> 00:20:37.716
-Fuck.
-The Witch.

00:20:37.799 --> 00:20:39.176
I mean, Mo Eun.

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:40.761
The Witch?

00:20:43.722 --> 00:20:44.556
Fuck.

00:20:45.974 --> 00:20:49.478
Damn, you are the one
who got our art teacher out of here?

00:20:52.981 --> 00:20:54.941
You look fucking weak though.

00:20:55.442 --> 00:20:59.738
Fuck, your arm is like a damn chopstick.
You actually killed someone with it?

00:21:04.242 --> 00:21:05.744
That was unnecessary, wasn't it?

00:21:05.827 --> 00:21:09.790
I mean, we'll split up after a few months
of living on top of each other anyway.

00:21:12.084 --> 00:21:14.127
As long as you don't provoke me first.

00:21:23.929 --> 00:21:24.763
Hey, Witch.

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:29.142
So nothing will happen
as long as no one provokes you, right?

00:21:30.685 --> 00:21:31.728
Yes.

00:21:33.688 --> 00:21:34.523
Hi.

00:21:34.606 --> 00:21:36.149
I'm Rowdy.

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:38.652
You're really pretty.

00:21:39.653 --> 00:21:41.738
You've got pretty eyes, nose, and lips.

00:21:41.822 --> 00:21:44.533
Damn, a girl like you
should be Miss Korea.

00:21:46.076 --> 00:21:47.244
Well, fuck.

00:21:47.327 --> 00:21:50.705
Don't they have fucking beauty pageants
in here for girls like her?

00:21:51.665 --> 00:21:53.208
You'll win for sure.

00:21:53.708 --> 00:21:55.377
They better give you tons of prizes.

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:56.586
Here.

00:22:31.329 --> 00:22:32.330
No!

00:22:34.624 --> 00:22:35.500
You must stop them.

00:22:37.502 --> 00:22:38.420
That person killed…

00:22:39.504 --> 00:22:41.298
Just let me go, for God's sake!

00:22:43.383 --> 00:22:44.926
-You have to stop them.
-Ms. An.

00:22:46.261 --> 00:22:47.971
That person killed my husband.

00:22:48.638 --> 00:22:50.557
That person killed my husband.

00:22:51.683 --> 00:22:52.642
"That person…"

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:54.519
We're taking you in…

00:22:54.603 --> 00:22:56.396
That person killed my husband.

00:22:58.064 --> 00:22:59.316
"…killed my

00:23:01.067 --> 00:23:01.902
husband."

00:23:02.903 --> 00:23:04.821
That person killed my husband.

00:23:24.382 --> 00:23:25.425
The hooded jacket…

00:23:28.261 --> 00:23:29.262
exists?

00:23:34.267 --> 00:23:35.268
There.

00:23:36.561 --> 00:23:38.355
Can you see them go into the station?

00:23:39.564 --> 00:23:40.649
Here.

00:23:41.149 --> 00:23:43.652
They lost them
after they slipped into the crowd.

00:23:45.695 --> 00:23:47.906
According to the police,

00:23:48.406 --> 00:23:50.784
it could be a paparazzo
or some crazy clout chaser.

00:23:51.284 --> 00:23:53.537
The kind trying to use you for attention.

00:23:54.037 --> 00:23:55.956
How can we find this person?

00:23:56.039 --> 00:23:58.833
It's been reported,
so we'll have to wait and see.

00:23:58.917 --> 00:24:00.794
We must find them at all costs.

00:24:03.505 --> 00:24:07.801
If it's making you feel that uneasy,
should I ask for extra patrols?

00:24:10.262 --> 00:24:11.096
No.

00:24:11.596 --> 00:24:12.639
It's okay.

00:24:16.226 --> 00:24:18.103
The person vanished without a trace.

00:24:19.688 --> 00:24:22.774
That means they switched outfits
right in the crowd.

00:24:23.275 --> 00:24:24.776
That's highly likely.

00:24:25.694 --> 00:24:27.320
But I just don't understand.

00:24:28.113 --> 00:24:30.323
Who would go to all this trouble?

00:24:30.407 --> 00:24:33.702
I heard all they did was sneak a peek
into the house.

00:24:34.327 --> 00:24:35.370
When it's confusing,

00:24:35.996 --> 00:24:38.164
rule out the uncertain things first.

00:24:38.665 --> 00:24:40.667
Then clarity will emerge.

00:24:41.293 --> 00:24:42.502
What would that be?

00:24:47.465 --> 00:24:50.218
Circumstantial clues
that the two women made a deal.

00:25:03.898 --> 00:25:07.152
Your husband's old college
reached out to me about his exhibition.

00:25:08.069 --> 00:25:11.114
They'd like to exhibit
what he was working on as a memorial.

00:25:13.074 --> 00:25:17.579
They asked if you could bring in
his last piece, which is in his studio.

00:25:46.566 --> 00:25:49.527
Don't close your eyes, Ki-dae.
Open your eyes. Don't close them.

00:25:50.945 --> 00:25:52.864
Don't close your eyes, Ki-dae.

00:25:53.823 --> 00:25:56.284
Please hurry!

00:26:28.024 --> 00:26:29.734
I'm breaking my back

00:26:31.361 --> 00:26:32.987
trying to keep our family afloat.

00:26:33.571 --> 00:26:35.657
No, it's not broken.

00:26:36.866 --> 00:26:38.076
-Hey, honey.
-Yeah?

00:26:38.159 --> 00:26:41.246
I might actually start teaching
at the university.

00:26:42.372 --> 00:26:44.082
Is the chair still talking you into it?

00:26:44.708 --> 00:26:46.626
I don't mind. You do what you want, babe.

00:26:47.127 --> 00:26:48.169
But

00:26:48.795 --> 00:26:50.880
don't you think my back's still sexy?

00:26:51.965 --> 00:26:53.049
What?

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:56.594
It's definitely sexy. You've still got it.

00:26:58.012 --> 00:26:59.431
-Let me do this, then.
-Hang on!

00:26:59.514 --> 00:27:00.348
Hey!

00:27:00.432 --> 00:27:02.809
-You're going to ruin it.
-No, I won't!

00:27:02.892 --> 00:27:04.310
You are if you do that.

00:27:04.394 --> 00:27:06.062
-But you did it.
-I did well.

00:27:06.855 --> 00:27:09.357
No erasing it, okay? You promised.

00:27:59.741 --> 00:28:02.452
Is this your drawing of her?

00:28:03.203 --> 00:28:04.537
Did you have feelings for him?

00:28:13.171 --> 00:28:14.589
OH SEO-WON

00:28:16.466 --> 00:28:19.177
The number you have dialed
is not in service.

00:28:19.677 --> 00:28:22.180
Please check the number and try again.

00:28:26.017 --> 00:28:28.686
The number you have dialed
is not in service.

00:28:29.187 --> 00:28:31.689
Please check the number and try again.

00:28:46.704 --> 00:28:49.123
MS. OH SEO-WON

00:29:26.452 --> 00:29:28.121
Are you here to see Seo-won?

00:29:28.872 --> 00:29:29.789
Yes.

00:29:29.873 --> 00:29:32.584
She left a few days ago,
saying she was going on a trip.

00:29:33.209 --> 00:29:34.294
To where?

00:29:34.377 --> 00:29:36.004
I don't know. She didn't say.

00:29:38.047 --> 00:29:38.882
Thank you.

00:29:39.549 --> 00:29:40.675
You're that friend,

00:29:41.426 --> 00:29:42.427
aren't you?

00:29:44.178 --> 00:29:47.390
She had such a hard time
after she was taken in for questioning.

00:29:48.182 --> 00:29:49.225
Why are you here?

00:29:58.651 --> 00:30:02.989
You think you can just skip procedures
and show up unannounced like this?

00:30:03.489 --> 00:30:04.449
It's not your case.

00:30:04.532 --> 00:30:07.327
Had I been on the case,
I wouldn't have come like this.

00:30:08.578 --> 00:30:10.288
I officially requested visitation.

00:30:11.164 --> 00:30:12.665
If this is personal,

00:30:14.334 --> 00:30:15.376
I can't allow it.

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:18.338
I was going to just leave
if the defendant refused.

00:30:18.421 --> 00:30:22.508
I didn't think
her attorney would show up like this.

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:26.137
Did you hear about An Yun-su?

00:30:28.097 --> 00:30:31.726
She violated probation and left her house
in the middle of the night.

00:30:32.226 --> 00:30:35.355
She could've had her bail revoked
and ended up back here, but--

00:30:35.438 --> 00:30:37.857
Why would you talk to my client
about Ms. An?

00:30:37.941 --> 00:30:41.069
Fortunately, she was caught by the police.

00:30:41.152 --> 00:30:44.197
She said she was after someone
who had intruded on her front yard.

00:30:45.782 --> 00:30:47.241
Who was it?

00:30:48.368 --> 00:30:49.953
That's what everyone wants to know.

00:30:50.036 --> 00:30:53.247
Who did she want to catch so badly

00:30:53.748 --> 00:30:57.126
that she'd leave her precious daughter
behind and even risk

00:30:57.710 --> 00:30:58.962
going back to prison?

00:31:00.254 --> 00:31:02.882
And during that time,
you went missing in here.

00:31:06.803 --> 00:31:08.638
What kind of answer are you…

00:31:08.721 --> 00:31:09.889
I don't want an answer.

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:12.266
I just thought you should know.

00:31:13.434 --> 00:31:16.521
I know you're curious
about what An Yun-su is up to out there.

00:31:16.604 --> 00:31:20.149
That's why you had your lawyer
deliver your letter to her

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:23.778
and made him exchange information
with her lawyer.

00:31:26.114 --> 00:31:28.491
Don't you know
accomplices can't talk to each other?

00:31:28.574 --> 00:31:30.326
Who are you calling an accomplice?

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:32.453
That's the prosecution's one-sided claim.

00:31:32.537 --> 00:31:34.455
It's a reasonable suspicion.

00:31:36.958 --> 00:31:38.710
And it's growing stronger every day.

00:31:40.962 --> 00:31:42.839
It is interesting.

00:31:43.548 --> 00:31:47.510
Why you'd come all the way here
just to feel me out.

00:31:48.886 --> 00:31:52.015
And who Yun-su was chasing last night.

00:31:52.932 --> 00:31:56.352
But please leave my attorney out of this.

00:31:57.061 --> 00:32:00.773
He already has the short end of the stick
with an impossible client.

00:32:02.442 --> 00:32:03.901
I think we're done here.

00:32:05.653 --> 00:32:06.946
We're done here.

00:32:15.997 --> 00:32:17.957
I know you're suspicious of both of them.

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:20.209
I get it.

00:32:21.419 --> 00:32:24.881
But it's uncomfortable
to see you baiting her this way.

00:32:27.175 --> 00:32:30.470
"Even a psychopath has the right
to a legal defense."

00:32:30.553 --> 00:32:34.265
That is probably the principle
that made you volunteer for the case.

00:32:35.641 --> 00:32:38.436
The way you people think
you're the only righteous ones.

00:32:39.645 --> 00:32:40.480
It…

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:43.274
it fucking makes me sick.

00:32:47.737 --> 00:32:50.156
There's no place for a lawyer
in this case.

00:32:51.365 --> 00:32:52.533
And you know it.

00:33:00.124 --> 00:33:02.543
You should go back now.
Your client is waiting.

00:33:13.638 --> 00:33:15.973
You really had
nothing to do with it, right?

00:33:17.308 --> 00:33:18.142
With what?

00:33:18.851 --> 00:33:22.063
With the person who showed up
at Ms. An's house last night.

00:33:23.147 --> 00:33:24.398
Do you actually think

00:33:25.358 --> 00:33:27.110
I somehow got out?

00:33:29.362 --> 00:33:30.321
Well, no.

00:33:30.988 --> 00:33:31.864
Not exactly.

00:33:33.991 --> 00:33:35.076
Then what?

00:33:46.129 --> 00:33:47.964
I didn't think you'd be the type.

00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:52.135
But you're also quite imaginative,
aren't you?

00:33:54.804 --> 00:33:58.516
It's just that Ms. An seems very anxious.

00:34:00.143 --> 00:34:01.394
I see.

00:34:11.028 --> 00:34:12.071
Stop.

00:34:12.155 --> 00:34:14.073
Inmates 278 and 3392, into your cells.

00:34:19.203 --> 00:34:20.079
Get going.

00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:00.828
Should we just go?

00:35:01.329 --> 00:35:04.248
Today's trial
is only about the dentist couple,

00:35:04.332 --> 00:35:06.417
so there's no need for you to attend.

00:35:06.918 --> 00:35:07.752
I can go alone--

00:35:07.835 --> 00:35:08.669
No.

00:35:10.338 --> 00:35:11.172
I want to see it.

00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:18.804
Those here for the trial,
please line up here.

00:35:18.888 --> 00:35:19.889
Reporters…

00:35:19.972 --> 00:35:21.182
THE DENTIST COUPLE MURDER

00:35:21.265 --> 00:35:23.017
…and those involved,
proceed to Courtroom 501.

00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:24.602
Those with a gallery pass,

00:35:25.269 --> 00:35:26.729
proceed to Video Courtroom 502.

00:35:26.812 --> 00:35:29.273
-Arms out, please.
-Make sure there's no confusion!

00:35:29.357 --> 00:35:31.150
Please line up over here. Great.

00:35:47.667 --> 00:35:50.336
I noticed your clothes
were all crumpled up last time.

00:35:50.836 --> 00:35:53.673
I tried to pick something
as similar as possible.

00:36:06.602 --> 00:36:07.520
Don't you like them?

00:36:08.187 --> 00:36:09.021
I just

00:36:10.439 --> 00:36:11.857
prefer my own clothes.

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:15.695
Sure.

00:36:22.285 --> 00:36:23.494
Thank you.

00:36:41.679 --> 00:36:42.513
This way.

00:36:55.526 --> 00:36:56.360
Are you okay?

00:37:32.897 --> 00:37:34.398
Please take a seat.

00:37:40.071 --> 00:37:43.407
Ms. An decided to stay in the next room
with her lawyer.

00:37:43.491 --> 00:37:45.284
You know, too many reporters here.

00:37:48.871 --> 00:37:50.956
How would you know who I'm looking for?

00:37:55.753 --> 00:37:57.421
I just ran into her on my way in.

00:37:59.632 --> 00:38:01.967
What about the victim's family?
Are they here?

00:38:03.010 --> 00:38:06.597
I think only the grandfather came.
He's in the next room too.

00:38:07.848 --> 00:38:08.682
Do you have

00:38:09.392 --> 00:38:10.935
something to tell them?

00:38:26.283 --> 00:38:27.118
Here.

00:38:28.327 --> 00:38:29.161
Over here.

00:38:31.205 --> 00:38:32.581
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:38:32.665 --> 00:38:34.166
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:35.251
Hello.

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:40.089
All rise.

00:38:56.355 --> 00:38:58.107
Please be seated.

00:39:13.873 --> 00:39:16.083
The defense
may make its opening statement.

00:39:16.167 --> 00:39:17.001
Yes, Your Honor.

00:39:24.675 --> 00:39:25.551
Not long ago,

00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:29.180
I asked the defendant
if she wanted anything

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:31.432
from me as her attorney.

00:39:31.515 --> 00:39:32.892
She replied,

00:39:33.559 --> 00:39:38.272
"Please just stay next to me
until the trial is over."

00:39:38.898 --> 00:39:39.732
The truth is,

00:39:40.858 --> 00:39:44.361
there's nothing I can do as her attorney.

00:39:45.196 --> 00:39:46.697
Her crime was

00:39:47.198 --> 00:39:49.825
too blatant and brutal
to plead for leniency.

00:39:50.326 --> 00:39:55.164
And because she knew this,
she didn't ask me for anything.

00:39:56.081 --> 00:39:59.543
Even so,
the reason I'm standing here today

00:40:00.252 --> 00:40:04.757
is to ensure the defendant
pays the proper price for her crime

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:06.467
as she lives on.

00:40:08.594 --> 00:40:10.137
Even if someone deserves to die…

00:40:10.221 --> 00:40:11.847
You don't…

00:40:12.348 --> 00:40:14.266
…they still have the right to live.

00:40:15.726 --> 00:40:17.269
You don't…

00:40:17.353 --> 00:40:20.898
The defendant has fully admitted
to all of her crimes.

00:40:20.981 --> 00:40:22.358
…have much time.

00:40:22.983 --> 00:40:25.861
Don't get

00:40:25.945 --> 00:40:29.907
any funny ideas.

00:40:31.617 --> 00:40:32.826
Also, the defendant…

00:40:39.375 --> 00:40:46.257
Don't get any funny ideas.

00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:50.386
…have much time.

00:40:52.638 --> 00:40:53.639
Just a moment!

00:40:54.348 --> 00:40:55.766
Ms. Mo, what did you just say?

00:40:56.350 --> 00:40:58.852
-Didn't you mouth something to the camera?
-Your Honor.

00:40:58.936 --> 00:41:00.104
Ms. Mo, what did you say?

00:41:00.187 --> 00:41:02.189
Your Honor,
he's interrupting my statement.

00:41:02.273 --> 00:41:05.401
You know you're not allowed to speak
from the gallery.

00:41:05.484 --> 00:41:06.694
Who were you mouthing to?

00:41:09.238 --> 00:41:11.073
Counselor, ask to review the footage.

00:41:11.156 --> 00:41:12.491
Prosecutor Baek Dong-hun,

00:41:12.575 --> 00:41:13.659
take your seat.

00:41:16.036 --> 00:41:18.539
Your Honor,
we ask to view the defendant's recording.

00:41:34.597 --> 00:41:36.473
"You don't have much time."

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:39.977
"Don't get any funny ideas."

00:41:51.614 --> 00:41:52.740
Should I say it again?

00:41:57.119 --> 00:41:58.912
"You don't have much time."

00:41:59.663 --> 00:42:01.332
"Don't get any funny ideas."

00:42:04.752 --> 00:42:05.794
Silence in court.

00:42:12.468 --> 00:42:13.302
Ms. Mo.

00:42:13.844 --> 00:42:15.220
Why did you say that?

00:42:15.304 --> 00:42:18.474
Who was it meant for,
and what did you mean by it?

00:42:18.557 --> 00:42:20.809
Objection, Your Honor. It's irrelevant.

00:42:21.310 --> 00:42:23.520
She said it in court during the trial.

00:42:23.604 --> 00:42:26.023
I will decide its relevance
after listening.

00:42:27.191 --> 00:42:28.275
Ms. Mo.

00:42:29.485 --> 00:42:30.569
Answer the question.

00:42:34.156 --> 00:42:36.200
It wouldn't be appropriate.

00:42:41.872 --> 00:42:43.415
Are you sure you want me

00:42:44.792 --> 00:42:46.085
to say it here?

00:43:00.516 --> 00:43:02.768
You don't have much time.

00:43:05.062 --> 00:43:07.314
Don't get any funny ideas.

00:43:17.616 --> 00:43:19.326
You don't have much time.

00:43:20.285 --> 00:43:21.620
Don't get any funny ideas.

00:47:08.513 --> 00:47:13.518
