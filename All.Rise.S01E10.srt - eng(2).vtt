(Guo Xiaoyu 2,
Ren Jiatong 2, Jiang Chen 1)

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.470
I still want to resolve this
in a lawyer's way.

00:02:00.071 --> 00:02:00.671
Like what?

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:03.990
Like handling the Warm Nest case.

00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:05.910
Only by staying in the program

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.070
can I fight for what should be mine.

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:10.070
I've considered your proposal.

00:02:10.311 --> 00:02:11.230
It's all reasonable.

00:02:11.311 --> 00:02:13.431
But without actual money on the table,

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:14.910
who'd be willing to compromise?

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.551
The biggest issue
for Warm Nest now is cash flow.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.350
Once he secures cash flow

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.151
and pays both landlords and tenants,

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.711
all problems will be solved.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:25.510
You mean

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.871
financing?

00:02:30.311 --> 00:02:32.230
That concludes my current proposal.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:33.831
Please provide feedback.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.391
Jiang Chen, someone submitted

00:02:43.391 --> 00:02:44.871
a proposal regarding financing

00:02:44.871 --> 00:02:45.750
to us earlier.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.871
Even analyzed the affected tenants.

00:02:48.151 --> 00:02:48.831
More detailed.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:09.311
You're something.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.991
Stealing my idea like that?

00:03:15.591 --> 00:03:16.350
I beat you

00:03:16.431 --> 00:03:17.431
not through your ideas,

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:19.790
but through the wealth of my data

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.350
and my comprehensive analysis.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.871
Clients don't want
lawyers' theoretical ideas.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:24.630
They want

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.271
concrete solutions that actually work.

00:03:27.991 --> 00:03:28.680
Alright.

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:31.230
Very educational.

00:03:37.271 --> 00:03:39.350
I appreciate you shielding me that day,

00:03:40.391 --> 00:03:41.591
but this is a competition.

00:03:42.311 --> 00:03:43.070
I want to win.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.470
Your speech this noon moved me too.

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.991
I truly value idealism in my heart.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:53.750
My father is like that.

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.391
But it's a luxury
I can't afford right now.

00:03:58.311 --> 00:03:59.991
Sometimes you're not wrong,

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.670
but you might not be able
to defend yourself.

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:04.750
I've been through that before.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.350
You'd better not take that risk.

00:04:08.591 --> 00:04:10.230
I've already contacted Liang Xiaosong.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.190
I'll meet him after work.

00:04:12.551 --> 00:04:13.311
Why?

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.751
Want to apologize to him for me?

00:04:17.711 --> 00:04:19.470
You think I'm not bowing to apologize

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:20.151
because of

00:04:20.951 --> 00:04:21.711
my pride?

00:04:22.191 --> 00:04:22.831
My ego?

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:24.951
This is my principle.

00:04:24.951 --> 00:04:26.071
Could you respect that?

00:04:26.071 --> 00:04:27.790
What gives you
the right to decide for me?

00:04:28.031 --> 00:04:29.310
Because I'm also involved.

00:04:29.831 --> 00:04:31.470
I was the first to go to the Warm Nest.

00:04:31.951 --> 00:04:32.870
Because this Weibo post

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.470
only had 400-500 reposts this morning,

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:35.790
but it's surpassed 10,000 now.

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:37.751
My photos have been dug up

00:04:37.751 --> 00:04:38.550
and posted below.

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:40.350
Because similar things

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:41.430
happened to me

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:42.711
when I first joined Jun An.

00:04:42.951 --> 00:04:44.790
I know netizens just want drama.

00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:46.910
No one truly cares about the truth.

00:05:43.151 --> 00:05:43.831
Everyone,

00:05:43.831 --> 00:05:44.831
it's exactly 9 PM.

00:05:45.151 --> 00:05:46.631
The final hour countdown starts.

00:05:47.071 --> 00:05:48.230
Submit your final proposals

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:49.151
on time.

00:05:50.031 --> 00:05:50.711
One minute late,

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:52.031
it's invalidated.

00:05:59.336 --> 00:06:02.470
(11 Hours Ago)

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:03.391
You can form teams,

00:06:04.031 --> 00:06:04.670
meaning

00:06:04.951 --> 00:06:07.790
points reflect battles between groups

00:06:08.191 --> 00:06:09.271
and inside them.

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:11.350
So that means

00:06:11.391 --> 00:06:13.391
I need both my group to win

00:06:13.751 --> 00:06:16.271
and my performance to be top in my group

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:17.550
for high scores.

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:18.472
Exactly.

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.391
Don't you want to work with top lawyers?

00:06:22.151 --> 00:06:22.870
Rare chance.

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:24.631
Show your best moves now.

00:06:27.452 --> 00:06:29.990
(Guo Xiaoyu's Choice)

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.110
Jiang Chen, come here.

00:06:36.392 --> 00:06:37.990
(Not replying to me again?)

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.951
(I thought we made up.)

00:06:39.191 --> 00:06:41.831
(Zhubao, I'm feeling down.)

00:06:43.071 --> 00:06:44.790
(What's wrong? Are you sick?)

00:06:45.928 --> 00:06:48.391
(No. Just under a lot of pressure.)

00:06:48.392 --> 00:06:49.896
(I ranked last last time.)

00:06:50.888 --> 00:06:52.712
(This round seems risky.)

00:06:53.672 --> 00:06:55.670
(Xiaoyu, why not come back?)

00:06:55.951 --> 00:06:57.271
(Seeing you like this hurts me.)

00:06:57.511 --> 00:06:58.711
(We've been apart too long.)

00:06:58.951 --> 00:07:00.230
(Things will change.)

00:07:01.352 --> 00:07:03.310
(Zhubao, are you afraid)

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.071
(I'll fall for other guys?)

00:07:05.928 --> 00:07:07.071
(Yes.)

00:07:07.112 --> 00:07:08.670
(I have persecutory delusions.)

(Guo Xiaoyu)

00:07:27.515 --> 00:07:31.176
(Busy now. Talk later, babe.)

00:07:33.191 --> 00:07:33.711
Come in.

00:07:35.711 --> 00:07:36.392
Please.

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:40.031
What's up?

00:07:41.951 --> 00:07:42.632
Jiatong.

00:07:43.071 --> 00:07:44.790
I totally agree with what you said

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:46.071
last night.

00:07:46.631 --> 00:07:48.031
If we don't settle this dispute,

00:07:48.071 --> 00:07:49.831
we'll never get our money back.

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:50.631
So...

00:07:52.511 --> 00:07:54.391
I've carefully analyzed the situation.

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:56.310
You have a settlement plan now,

00:07:56.711 --> 00:07:58.151
and I've been organizing

00:07:58.151 --> 00:07:58.951
the victim profiles.

00:08:00.391 --> 00:08:00.990
How about

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:02.831
we team up to tackle this?

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:05.670
Don't you want to beat Jiang Chen?

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:06.790
This round, you will.

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:10.751
Guiding negotiations

00:08:10.751 --> 00:08:12.110
to favor your terms

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:14.230
while making them
feel you're on their side.

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:16.031
Good for you, Guo Xiaoyu.

00:08:16.191 --> 00:08:18.230
You've been applying
your idol Mr. Song's methods

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:19.511
better and better lately.

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:22.151
Even the slowest student can improve

00:08:22.151 --> 00:08:23.110
with a good mentor.

00:08:23.591 --> 00:08:24.831
Mr. Song is my main mentor,

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:27.191
and Jiatong, you're my secondary coach.

00:08:28.511 --> 00:08:29.951
Let's form a team.

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:32.271
It's not just for your sake.

00:08:33.231 --> 00:08:34.111
I benefit too.

00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:35.670
Like you said,

00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:36.471
can't there be

00:08:36.471 --> 00:08:38.111
a win-win solution?

00:08:38.751 --> 00:08:40.631
I absolutely can't be last this round.

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:43.031
Even if my pride were made of steel,

00:08:43.271 --> 00:08:43.790
it couldn't

00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:45.751
stand being trampled on over and over.

00:08:46.991 --> 00:08:47.830
We won't be last.

00:08:49.511 --> 00:08:50.351
This round,

00:08:50.871 --> 00:08:51.751
we'll be the top.

00:08:59.511 --> 00:09:01.190
When I first joined Jun An,

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:02.710
I was anxious every day.

00:09:03.631 --> 00:09:05.830
After studying so hard in college,

00:09:06.151 --> 00:09:07.511
I couldn't do anything practical.

00:09:08.111 --> 00:09:09.830
But today, I'm thrilled

00:09:10.391 --> 00:09:11.430
because Jiatong said

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:12.871
my materials were super useful.

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:15.550
We're sure to win this time

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:16.830
and help everyone else.

00:09:17.271 --> 00:09:18.511
Don't celebrate yet.

00:09:18.751 --> 00:09:19.710
Wait for the results.

00:09:22.111 --> 00:09:23.151
Zhubao, remember

00:09:23.151 --> 00:09:24.151
my junior mentor?

00:09:25.031 --> 00:09:25.790
He broke up...

00:09:26.471 --> 00:09:28.271
with his girlfriend of seven years

00:09:28.271 --> 00:09:30.031
over a work issue

00:09:30.271 --> 00:09:31.070
at Jun An.

00:09:31.631 --> 00:09:34.231
Once when you made me mad,

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:36.391
you played a piggy to cheer me up.

00:09:36.391 --> 00:09:37.111
It worked well.

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:39.430
So I'll copy your idea

00:09:39.991 --> 00:09:41.910
to help him win his girlfriend back.

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:44.310
Xiaoyu.

00:09:45.471 --> 00:09:45.991
For you,

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:48.031
does work come before me?

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:50.790
Would you abandon me

00:09:51.231 --> 00:09:51.830
for your job?

00:09:52.231 --> 00:09:53.231
Or quit your job

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:54.631
for me?

00:09:55.271 --> 00:09:57.751
Zhubao, why drag us into this?

00:09:58.590 --> 00:09:59.790
It's not the same situation.

00:10:00.271 --> 00:10:01.391
How is it different?

00:10:02.031 --> 00:10:02.670
Xiaoyu.

00:10:03.111 --> 00:10:04.111
I really don't get

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:06.511
why you're so obsessed with this job.

00:10:06.511 --> 00:10:07.471
What's the point?

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:09.190
I'm already swamped,

00:10:09.631 --> 00:10:10.710
but you're even busier now.

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:13.231
We barely have time to talk anymore.

00:10:13.471 --> 00:10:14.511
If this continues,

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:16.031
how long do you think we'll last?

00:10:18.871 --> 00:10:19.471
What is that?

00:10:19.471 --> 00:10:20.710
You don't love me anymore?

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:24.271
It's noon.

00:10:24.751 --> 00:10:25.430
I need to rest.

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:26.511
Talk later.

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:30.830
You hung up on me again.

00:10:34.511 --> 00:10:35.670
Why so many forms?

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:38.190
These are information sheets
from the tenants

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:39.430
I contacted.

00:10:44.471 --> 00:10:45.710
Can I join your group?

00:10:46.231 --> 00:10:47.031
I can code

00:10:47.271 --> 00:10:49.471
and create a database
to process info faster.

00:10:50.031 --> 00:10:51.271
About what happened before,

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:52.670
I'm sorry.

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:55.391
I genuinely want to help you this time,

00:10:56.231 --> 00:10:57.271
and help myself too.

00:11:06.391 --> 00:11:06.984
Here.

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:08.008
Thank you.

00:11:08.151 --> 00:11:08.871
Busy all morning.

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:10.070
I'm feeling hypoglycemic.

00:11:13.751 --> 00:11:15.631
Guo Xiaoyu, do you
even know confidentiality?

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:17.151
Our first-day training.

00:11:18.871 --> 00:11:20.471
Jiatong, don't blame Xiaoyu.

00:11:20.751 --> 00:11:22.231
Actually, I want to join your team.

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:26.031
To be honest, I don't have
a better plan right now.

00:11:26.391 --> 00:11:27.670
But I don't want to lose.

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:29.830
I'll step out first.

00:11:30.031 --> 00:11:30.830
You two can talk.

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:32.830
I'll accept whatever outcome.

00:11:44.271 --> 00:11:45.751
Have you forgotten what happened?

00:11:47.151 --> 00:11:48.511
Jiatong, don't be mad.

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:51.231
Huang Yue's database
is genuinely well-made.

00:11:51.751 --> 00:11:53.391
She's already apologized to me.

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:55.430
I really think she can help us.

00:11:55.871 --> 00:11:57.710
Let's team up
for this round of assessment.

00:11:58.991 --> 00:12:00.151
If a teammate makes an error,

00:12:00.151 --> 00:12:01.910
our chances of elimination increase.

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:03.511
More people mean higher risks.

00:12:05.151 --> 00:12:05.800
Xiaoyu.

00:12:06.351 --> 00:12:08.590
The first lesson I learned
at my previous firm was

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:10.550
that no matter
how close to your comrades,

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:12.391
never expose your back to them.

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:14.550
This lesson's free for you.

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:17.471
What about us?

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:22.111
I contributed to this plan too, right?

00:12:22.111 --> 00:12:24.190
Shouldn't I have
some decision-making power?

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:27.151
I'm not stupid. I know
the assessment is crucial.

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:28.830
But I don't think

00:12:29.031 --> 00:12:30.910
competitors have to be enemies.

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:33.471
I don't know what you all think,

00:12:33.751 --> 00:12:35.790
but since coming to Jun An this time,

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:36.830
one of my biggest gains

00:12:38.031 --> 00:12:38.751
has been you guys.

00:13:07.035 --> 00:13:12.584
(Warm Nest Victim Information Form)

00:13:38.271 --> 00:13:39.190
We have two proposals.

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:40.871
First, rent reduction.

00:13:40.871 --> 00:13:43.111
For tenants unable to pay rent,

00:13:43.351 --> 00:13:45.111
we can temporarily
suspend rent collection

00:13:45.111 --> 00:13:47.790
and offer proportional reductions

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:49.471
until tenants get relocated.

00:13:49.471 --> 00:13:52.031
Second, rent refunds.

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:54.111
For prepaid rent,

00:13:54.471 --> 00:13:56.670
provide full or partial refunds

00:13:56.751 --> 00:13:58.710
to alleviate
the tenants' financial pressure.

00:13:59.111 --> 00:14:00.670
That is all.

00:14:04.764 --> 00:14:06.632
(Thank you!
By Ren Jiatong, Guo Xiaoyu, Huang Yue)

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:08.310
If by 10 PM tonight,

00:14:08.351 --> 00:14:10.231
you can't present a better plan,

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:12.950
the Warm Nest meeting
will be handled by me, Ren Jiatong,

00:14:13.351 --> 00:14:14.151
and your team.

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:16.296
Okay.

00:14:23.676 --> 00:14:30.632
(Ren Jiatong: I brought Huang Yue in
because she could help us.)

00:14:30.632 --> 00:14:32.904
(Competitors are competitors.)

00:14:32.904 --> 00:14:34.670
(Never show your back, not even on me.)

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:35.710
(Friendship and rivalry.)

00:14:36.271 --> 00:14:37.670
(Guo Xiaoyu repeatedly)

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:39.271
(faces the dilemma.)

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:45.096
Everyone,

00:14:45.231 --> 00:14:46.190
it's exactly 9 PM.

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:48.031
The final hour countdown starts.

00:14:48.511 --> 00:14:49.631
Submit your final proposals

00:14:49.631 --> 00:14:50.550
on time.

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:52.231
One minute late,

00:14:52.871 --> 00:14:53.550
it's invalidated.

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:54.790
Receive the file.

00:14:55.511 --> 00:14:56.391
(Throughout this day,)

00:14:56.751 --> 00:14:58.950
(Li Ke should be the best
at making decisions.)

00:15:09.751 --> 00:15:10.376
Mr. Zhou.

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:11.751
With such tight timelines,

00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:13.151
can we form teams?

00:15:13.471 --> 00:15:14.391
Right.

00:15:14.871 --> 00:15:15.790
You can form teams,

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:17.031
meaning

00:15:17.471 --> 00:15:20.310
(Current points: 25)
points reflect battles between groups

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:21.751
(Current points: 35)
and inside them.

00:15:21.871 --> 00:15:22.910
So that means

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:24.991
(Current points: 35)
I need both my group to win

00:15:25.271 --> 00:15:27.751
(Current points: 40)
and my performance to be top in my group

00:15:28.031 --> 00:15:29.111
for high scores.

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:29.832
Exactly.

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.670
(Current points: 30)
Don't you want to work with top lawyers?

00:15:33.064 --> 00:15:34.190
(Li Ke and His Adorer)
Rare chance.

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:35.950
Show your best moves now.

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:50.991
Okay, sweetie, happy birthday.

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:52.910
I will get you a big cake when I'm back.

00:15:56.471 --> 00:15:58.231
I miss you too. I miss you too.

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:00.968
Here.

00:16:01.511 --> 00:16:03.031
Thanks, thanks.

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:07.590
It's my niece's birthday today, see?

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:09.031
She's so adorable.

00:16:09.031 --> 00:16:09.670
Absolutely.

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:12.070
Let me recommend you a bakery.

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:13.031
Their cakes are amazing.

00:16:13.391 --> 00:16:14.190
Really?

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:14.830
Good.

00:16:15.656 --> 00:16:16.271
Sent it to you.

00:16:16.271 --> 00:16:16.830
Thanks.

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:20.550
How do you adjust
your mindset like this?

00:16:21.271 --> 00:16:22.031
It's impressive.

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:23.511
When working earlier,

00:16:23.511 --> 00:16:24.351
you looked drained.

00:16:24.351 --> 00:16:25.751
Now, you're fine again.

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:29.471
With my last-round ranking so low,
how could I not be looking down?

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:31.231
I'm practically falling apart.

00:16:31.871 --> 00:16:32.511
But

00:16:32.631 --> 00:16:34.471
you shouldn't listen to my complaints.

00:16:35.031 --> 00:16:36.471
I don't want to spread negativity

00:16:36.471 --> 00:16:37.471
to those around me.

00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:39.070
Especially now,

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:40.710
when everyone's under pressure.

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:43.950
Besides, your niece
is genuinely adorable.

00:16:44.231 --> 00:16:44.991
So heartwarming.

00:16:45.151 --> 00:16:45.871
Of course she is.

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:47.950
How's your proposal?

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:50.430
Just okay.

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:51.991
Hoping to at least pass.

00:16:52.351 --> 00:16:53.031
A passing grade?

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:56.910
Back in school, passing was good enough.

00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:58.670
But in the workplace,

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:00.070
it is nowhere near sufficient.

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:03.871
Maybe you should team up with someone?

00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:06.911
I'm at the bottom tier. Can't help you.

00:17:07.031 --> 00:17:08.711
But if you partner
with the right person,

00:17:08.711 --> 00:17:09.751
maybe next round,

00:17:09.751 --> 00:17:11.150
both our scores could improve.

00:17:12.671 --> 00:17:13.590
Teaming up?

00:17:15.991 --> 00:17:18.031
I just saw Guo Xiaoyu and Ren Jiatong

00:17:18.231 --> 00:17:20.070
head to the small conference room.

00:17:27.751 --> 00:17:28.390
S-Sorry.

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:29.150
I have to go.

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:36.711
Ms. Bai's mentoring style hasn't changed

00:17:36.711 --> 00:17:37.511
over the years.

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:39.031
Always playing the villain.

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:41.471
If she hadn't fought
for Jiang Chen this time,

00:17:41.991 --> 00:17:43.830
he wouldn't have just gotten
point deductions.

00:17:44.991 --> 00:17:46.751
Warm Nest really put us in a tough spot.

00:17:47.231 --> 00:17:49.350
During critical negotiations,

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:50.830
your brother-in-law's stunt

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:52.431
gave them the perfect excuse

00:17:52.511 --> 00:17:53.550
to shift blame onto us.

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:55.191
From what I gathered,

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:56.671
Warm Nest's legal director

00:17:56.991 --> 00:17:58.271
is pushing their CEO

00:17:58.271 --> 00:17:59.150
to replace our firm.

00:17:59.671 --> 00:18:00.711
Notice those subtle digs

00:18:00.711 --> 00:18:01.911
during the meeting?

00:18:02.511 --> 00:18:03.150
My fault.

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:04.751
I failed with my family issue.

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:06.191
I've tried all morning.

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:07.830
Xiaosong and his sister blocked me.

00:18:08.191 --> 00:18:09.310
After the test is over,

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:11.110
I'll go apologize.

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:14.590
As a woman,

00:18:15.031 --> 00:18:16.590
I can understand your girlfriend.

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:18.711
But as a colleague,

00:18:19.911 --> 00:18:20.951
it feels infuriating.

00:18:26.511 --> 00:18:28.671
This isn't just about Mr. Zhou anymore.

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:30.630
The entire firm

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:31.870
is working on it, right?

00:18:33.511 --> 00:18:34.511
Bring that up?

00:18:35.191 --> 00:18:36.110
Let's stop talking.

00:18:36.511 --> 00:18:37.064
Wait.

00:18:37.951 --> 00:18:39.590
You don't fear Warm Nest's legal action,

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:40.790
but Mr. Zhou does.

00:18:41.431 --> 00:18:42.790
You can claim

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:43.550
you're the victim,

00:18:43.671 --> 00:18:44.511
but can he?

00:18:44.711 --> 00:18:45.870
If Warm Nest investigates,

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:46.751
can they bypass him?

00:18:47.031 --> 00:18:48.431
But how is this his responsibility?

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:50.191
He didn't wrong us

00:18:50.191 --> 00:18:51.630
or his fiancée.

00:18:51.951 --> 00:18:53.070
Why is he being blamed?

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:54.031
You're so selfish.

00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:57.671
I see you're worried,

00:18:58.951 --> 00:19:01.031
and I don't want Mr. Zhou
to suffer for me, either.

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:02.870
Liang Xiaosong wants money.

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:03.590
I'll pay him.

00:19:03.991 --> 00:19:04.790
Just give me time.

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:06.511
I'll have a solution by afternoon. Okay?

00:19:07.431 --> 00:19:07.991
I'm sorry.

00:19:07.991 --> 00:19:09.471
I got too emotional earlier.

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:10.951
But anyway,

00:19:10.951 --> 00:19:12.711
your compensation is peanuts

00:19:13.271 --> 00:19:15.070
compared to the millions
Jun An could lose

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:16.031
if our firm is replaced

00:19:16.031 --> 00:19:17.870
by Warm Nest.

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:19.711
Even if we sold off you, me and Mr. Zhou

00:19:19.711 --> 00:19:20.671
together,

00:19:20.671 --> 00:19:21.550
we couldn't cover it.

00:19:22.031 --> 00:19:23.110
Don't be reckless now.

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:24.712
Understood.

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.991
Honestly,

00:19:28.911 --> 00:19:30.630
apologizing isn't that hard.

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:33.271
Post on Weibo or WeChat,

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:35.432
even set it to be viewed "only by him".

00:19:35.711 --> 00:19:37.231
It's just about showing goodwill.

00:19:37.471 --> 00:19:39.231
How can principles be

00:19:39.231 --> 00:19:39.991
casually changed?

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:42.536
So you...

00:19:48.471 --> 00:19:49.751
Only you're the principled one?

00:19:57.711 --> 00:19:58.711
I saw in the group chat.

00:19:58.711 --> 00:20:00.031
You'll give Mr. Zhou's girlfriend

00:20:00.031 --> 00:20:00.991
a surprise?

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:02.231
Count me in.

00:20:04.191 --> 00:20:05.191
Not sure if it'll work.

00:20:05.671 --> 00:20:06.471
I heard

00:20:06.471 --> 00:20:07.191
Mr. Zhou might be

00:20:07.191 --> 00:20:08.830
affected by his brother-in-law's issue.

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:10.431
If this escalates,

00:20:10.431 --> 00:20:11.590
Warm Nest will come after us.

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:13.191
Forget surprises. We'll be done for.

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:14.110
Surprise?

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:15.471
Are you implying

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:17.471
the Warm Nest matter
will affect Mr. Zhou?

00:20:17.711 --> 00:20:18.550
Not just him.

00:20:19.191 --> 00:20:20.110
The entire firm...

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:28.616
Fei.

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:30.024
Look.

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:32.911
Jiang Chen's involved
in such a major problem.

00:20:33.191 --> 00:20:34.431
If we team up

00:20:34.911 --> 00:20:36.110
in this round,

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:37.751
we might overtake him.

00:20:40.191 --> 00:20:41.590
Doesn't it frustrate you

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:42.350
to be overshadowed?

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:45.070
Include me when you finalize the plan.

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:47.790
As for the assessment,
I think we should depend on

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:49.031
our own ability.

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:52.360
See you.

00:20:59.951 --> 00:21:00.870
We have two proposals.

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:02.550
First, rent reduction.

00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:04.830
For tenants unable to pay rent,

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:06.830
we can temporarily
suspend rent collection

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:09.271
and offer proportional reductions

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:10.911
until tenants get relocated.

00:21:10.951 --> 00:21:13.231
Second, rent refunds.

00:21:13.271 --> 00:21:15.310
For prepaid rent,

00:21:15.511 --> 00:21:17.671
provide full or partial refunds

00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:19.671
to alleviate
the tenants' financial pressure.

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:21.310
That is all.

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:22.031
Hello, everyone.

00:21:22.031 --> 00:21:23.191
My approach is continuing

00:21:23.191 --> 00:21:24.431
litigation preparations.

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:26.511
If settlement negotiations fail,

00:21:26.511 --> 00:21:27.671
we need backup strategies.

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:29.550
If you ever research

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:31.751
numerous rental contract disputes

00:21:31.751 --> 00:21:32.951
in legal practice,

00:21:33.431 --> 00:21:35.431
you'll find this path challenging.

00:21:36.271 --> 00:21:36.968
Ms. Bai.

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:38.350
Let him finish.

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:39.991
He's working hard.

00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:41.992
Li Ke.

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:44.296
Continue.

00:21:46.271 --> 00:21:46.824
Alright.

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:56.744
Jiang Chen.

00:21:57.911 --> 00:22:00.031
Your earlier suggestion

00:22:00.031 --> 00:22:01.031
shows potential.

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:01.911
I have some ideas.

00:22:01.911 --> 00:22:02.536
Want to

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:03.550
talk about it?

00:22:03.711 --> 00:22:04.471
Maybe

00:22:05.511 --> 00:22:06.231
I can help.

00:22:06.911 --> 00:22:07.560
No, thanks.

00:22:07.911 --> 00:22:08.550
I can handle it.

00:22:10.711 --> 00:22:11.830
More hands make light work.

00:22:12.191 --> 00:22:14.191
We might win first place together.

00:22:17.951 --> 00:22:18.911
Is this because

00:22:19.511 --> 00:22:20.870
we just argued?

00:22:21.271 --> 00:22:21.928
So...

00:22:22.911 --> 00:22:23.550
That's separate.

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:26.271
I'm not refusing teamwork,

00:22:26.671 --> 00:22:28.550
but this case is special.

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:30.110
It's not only a legal case,

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:31.231
but also

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:32.790
a personal matter.

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:34.271
I must handle it myself.

00:22:35.231 --> 00:22:35.976
Keep going.

00:22:36.991 --> 00:22:37.640
Wait...

00:22:51.511 --> 00:22:52.271
Go, Uncle.

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:53.830
Uncle's the best.

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:04.590
(If by 10 PM tonight,)

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:06.550
(you can't present a better plan,)

00:23:06.751 --> 00:23:09.070
(the Warm Nest meeting
will be handled by me, Ren Jiatong,)

00:23:09.431 --> 00:23:10.271
(and your team.)

00:23:14.671 --> 00:23:15.390
Everyone,

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:16.310
it's exactly 9 PM.

00:23:16.671 --> 00:23:18.070
The final hour countdown starts.

00:23:18.751 --> 00:23:19.870
Submit your final proposals

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:20.790
on time.

00:23:21.671 --> 00:23:22.376
One minute late,

00:23:22.951 --> 00:23:23.630
it's invalidated.

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:25.431
Receive the file.

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:41.800
Come in.

00:23:43.144 --> 00:23:44.070
Mr. Zhuang.

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:44.711
Waiting for you.

00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:46.271
Ms. Bai,

00:23:47.191 --> 00:23:48.711
must we be so harsh?

00:23:51.031 --> 00:23:52.830
If someone collapses from overwork,

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:55.550
our firm will be labeled

00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:56.271
as bloodsuckers.

00:23:57.390 --> 00:23:58.390
Our firm advocates for

00:23:58.390 --> 00:23:59.271
work-life balance.

00:23:59.271 --> 00:24:00.191
This isn't empty talk.

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:00.991
Look at them.

00:24:01.231 --> 00:24:02.231
I didn't force them.

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:04.150
Haven't we all gone through that?

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:05.630
Plus, back when we

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:07.310
worked cases with Mr. Zhuang,

00:24:07.511 --> 00:24:09.191
we pulled just as many all-nighters.

00:24:09.511 --> 00:24:10.070
Right?

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.824
Don't.

00:24:11.191 --> 00:24:12.231
Don't drag me into this.

00:24:12.751 --> 00:24:14.471
You all volunteered to work overtime.

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:16.830
No threats or bribes from me.

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:18.110
Right?

00:24:18.991 --> 00:24:19.656
Right.

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:21.271
I hear they are

00:24:21.271 --> 00:24:22.070
secretly planning

00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:24.511
to help Zhou Nian
reconcile with his girlfriend.

00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:26.590
They say Zhou Nian always

00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:27.671
puts in so much for them.

00:24:27.951 --> 00:24:29.231
He must have his wedding day.

00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:31.790
We have a great eye for talent.

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:32.991
These kids

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:34.110
are all decent.

00:24:36.911 --> 00:24:37.991
You two have been working

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:40.751
round the clock with Warm Nest.

00:24:41.471 --> 00:24:42.110
Thank you.

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:47.350
I heard there was an issue earlier.

00:24:48.231 --> 00:24:49.110
How's it now?

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:51.711
They did mention wanting

00:24:51.711 --> 00:24:54.150
to transfer other business
to other firms.

00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:55.231
But for now,

00:24:55.231 --> 00:24:56.350
we've put that on hold.

00:24:56.751 --> 00:24:58.191
Mr. Song's financing proposal

00:24:58.191 --> 00:25:00.191
received strong approval
from their CEO, Mr. Liu.

00:25:00.191 --> 00:25:01.830
The investors we connected them with

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:03.310
provided initial letters of intent.

00:25:03.951 --> 00:25:04.471
Here.

00:25:04.911 --> 00:25:05.448
Good.

00:25:16.751 --> 00:25:17.790
But their legal director

00:25:18.231 --> 00:25:19.511
seems off to me.

00:25:19.991 --> 00:25:21.590
A lucrative client like Warm Nest

00:25:22.191 --> 00:25:23.390
naturally attracts

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:24.951
big law firms.

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:34.152
Come in.

00:25:35.191 --> 00:25:35.848
Ms. Bai.

00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:36.711
You need me?

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:38.711
I reviewed your report.

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:40.751
Your compensation estimates

00:25:40.751 --> 00:25:42.070
favor the tenants' perspective.

00:25:42.511 --> 00:25:43.830
Because you're a tenant yourself?

00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:46.671
But have you considered

00:25:46.671 --> 00:25:47.550
the landlords?

00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:49.150
The other day,

00:25:49.231 --> 00:25:50.191
at Warm Nest,

00:25:50.191 --> 00:25:51.590
that huge conflict erupted

00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:52.671
because

00:25:52.671 --> 00:25:54.350
many landlords were also protesting.

00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:55.991
Just because they hit you

00:25:56.231 --> 00:25:58.271
doesn't mean you ignore
their legitimate claims.

00:25:58.271 --> 00:26:00.071
Your report is well-formed now,

00:26:00.136 --> 00:26:01.323
but I want it to be better.

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:16.870
I'm not hogging this spot.

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:19.110
Half is yours.

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:24.951
I just spoke with Ms. Bai.

00:26:25.991 --> 00:26:27.310
I need to apologize.

00:26:30.711 --> 00:26:31.471
You've come around?

00:26:32.231 --> 00:26:32.911
Not at all.

00:26:34.671 --> 00:26:35.830
But in the pantry,

00:26:36.991 --> 00:26:38.350
I overheard our BD director Kai

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:39.870
apologizing to Warm Nest

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:41.550
about my situation.

00:26:42.031 --> 00:26:43.790
It made me uncomfortable.

00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:46.590
If Jun An loses

00:26:47.511 --> 00:26:49.031
a major client paying premium fees

00:26:49.031 --> 00:26:51.590
because of my personal issues,

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:53.951
then fighting for my rights

00:26:53.951 --> 00:26:54.751
costs too much.

00:26:58.671 --> 00:27:00.390
A great lawyer once told me

00:27:02.431 --> 00:27:04.590
the first lesson for us
was learning to compromise.

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:05.471
I didn't buy it.

00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:08.431
Now, I'm having doubts.

00:27:10.031 --> 00:27:11.671
Was that great lawyer

00:27:12.271 --> 00:27:13.031
your father?

00:27:18.711 --> 00:27:19.471
I understand him,

00:27:20.191 --> 00:27:20.870
but I

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:22.511
don't want to become him.

00:27:24.031 --> 00:27:25.550
Maybe I'm not cut out to be a lawyer.

00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:29.271
What did Mr. Song say?

00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:31.870
He asked if I apologized

00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:33.390
for Jun An now,

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:37.271
how I'd view myself

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:38.390
and this profession

00:27:39.231 --> 00:27:40.951
in the future.

00:27:42.911 --> 00:27:43.751
I told him I'd be

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:46.511
deeply disappointed in myself.

00:27:47.511 --> 00:27:50.110
Just like I've been let down
by other lawyers.

00:27:51.191 --> 00:27:52.431
I might end up becoming

00:27:52.431 --> 00:27:53.830
that kind of lawyer.

00:27:54.751 --> 00:27:55.790
I want to make good money.

00:27:55.951 --> 00:27:56.951
I want to win every time.

00:28:03.031 --> 00:28:04.350
That lawyer also told me

00:28:06.271 --> 00:28:07.191
in our profession,

00:28:07.191 --> 00:28:08.911
you must maintain sufficient hunger

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:10.150
and ambition.

00:28:12.031 --> 00:28:13.070
You possess both.

00:28:13.751 --> 00:28:15.310
I believe if he were here,

00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:16.031
he'd say you'd

00:28:16.031 --> 00:28:17.350
make a better lawyer than me.

00:28:18.711 --> 00:28:19.368
Really?

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:21.070
Of course not.

00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:21.630
I made it up.

00:28:22.671 --> 00:28:24.790
Mr. Song said instead of compromising,

00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:25.310
we should

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:26.790
try to think of a win-win solution.

00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:28.671
So I came up here to brainstorm.

00:28:29.951 --> 00:28:30.696
What about you?

00:28:31.511 --> 00:28:32.350
Ms. Bai scolded you.

00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:34.070
What was it about?

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:36.390
How do you know?

00:28:39.671 --> 00:28:40.711
Since you joined Jun An,

00:28:40.711 --> 00:28:42.191
she hasn't scolded you often.

00:28:42.271 --> 00:28:43.991
But whenever it happens,
you come up here

00:28:44.231 --> 00:28:45.310
for exactly ten minutes.

00:28:55.471 --> 00:28:56.991
I used to be quite confident,

00:28:58.031 --> 00:28:59.150
but I never imagined

00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:00.590
making such a rookie mistake.

00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:02.150
But

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:03.751
Ms. Bai helped me realize

00:29:03.751 --> 00:29:06.110
the importance of thinking
from the landlords' perspective.

00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:08.671
But my interactions with them

00:29:09.031 --> 00:29:10.790
are limited to that fight at Warm Nest

00:29:11.431 --> 00:29:12.911
and my argument on move-in day

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:14.191
with your aunt.

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:20.711
Jiang Chen,

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:22.991
your aunt is my landlord.

00:29:26.911 --> 00:29:28.991
I think I've found the solution.

00:29:30.271 --> 00:29:31.951
I need to have a talk with my aunt.

00:29:36.991 --> 00:29:37.870
10 minutes are up.

00:29:39.191 --> 00:29:39.816
Let's go.

00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:41.110
The battle isn't over.

00:29:41.431 --> 00:29:42.310
Actually, it's true.

00:29:44.431 --> 00:29:45.160
What?

00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:48.751
You're the most suited one
for the law I've ever met.

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:51.231
I know.

00:30:03.751 --> 00:30:04.310
Guo Xiaoyu,

00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:05.711
you handle proofreading.

00:30:05.991 --> 00:30:06.550
No problem.

00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:07.431
Huang Yue,

00:30:07.431 --> 00:30:08.310
assist Jiang Chen

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:09.911
in analyzing the landlords' needs.

00:30:15.271 --> 00:30:16.231
There are three hours.

00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:17.751
I'll go talk to Liang.

00:30:21.031 --> 00:30:21.911
Let me do it.

00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:24.911
We're a team now.

00:30:25.231 --> 00:30:26.110
I'm the team leader.

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:28.231
I expect you to listen to me.

00:30:29.231 --> 00:30:30.271
Moreover, this plan

00:30:30.271 --> 00:30:32.070
requires your aunt's full cooperation.

00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:33.110
So you need to stay here

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:34.630
to ensure every word is flawless.

00:30:37.751 --> 00:30:39.070
The Warm Nest crisis

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:40.271
started because of me.

00:30:41.191 --> 00:30:42.070
I'll go myself.

00:30:42.471 --> 00:30:43.070
Besides,

00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:44.911
I'm not going to bow and apologize.

00:30:45.471 --> 00:30:47.031
I'll make him apologize to us.

00:30:50.431 --> 00:30:51.830
I can accompany Ren Jiatong.

00:30:55.271 --> 00:30:56.310
I want to help Jun An

00:30:56.751 --> 00:30:57.991
and Mr. Zhou with this.

00:30:59.671 --> 00:31:00.296
Okay?

00:31:04.431 --> 00:31:05.231
Absolutely.

00:31:05.991 --> 00:31:06.632
Come here.

00:31:13.671 --> 00:31:15.390
To clear Jiang Chen's name,

00:31:16.231 --> 00:31:17.431
I repeatedly watched

00:31:17.471 --> 00:31:19.070
the video of his conflict with Liang.

00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:21.070
See this guy with the buzz cut?

00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:21.991
Remember him?

00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:29.550
I think I saw him
at the Warm Nest branch.

00:31:30.431 --> 00:31:31.830
The handwritten response.

00:31:32.296 --> 00:31:32.951
Xiaoyu,

00:31:32.951 --> 00:31:34.630
check your livestream video

00:31:34.751 --> 00:31:36.431
to see if he was present that day.

00:31:36.751 --> 00:31:37.384
Let me check.

00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:41.832
I found him.

00:31:46.231 --> 00:31:47.271
Who is this guy anyway?

00:31:47.271 --> 00:31:48.150
He's everywhere.

00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:58.310
On the day of our Warm Nest conflict,

00:31:58.671 --> 00:32:00.951
that man with you
was a lawyer too, right?

00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:02.184
What?

00:32:02.431 --> 00:32:03.310
He's not a tenant,

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:04.231
not a landlord,

00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:05.991
and not Warm Nest's legal staff.

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:08.751
He's a lawyer from our competitor firm.

00:32:09.031 --> 00:32:10.150
He was present every time.

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:12.424
(Wang Yu)
Look.

00:32:12.711 --> 00:32:13.390
It's him, right?

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:25.711
He said he was Warm Nest's legal member

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:29.150
and that you were
from Jun An to gather intel.

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:30.911
And that you were a tenant.

00:32:31.271 --> 00:32:32.671
So Jun An would never take my side

00:32:33.431 --> 00:32:34.550
or compensate us.

00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:36.511
That water bottle

00:32:37.231 --> 00:32:37.870
was from him.

00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:41.870
Song.

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:44.231
Your sister's been dating Mr. Zhou

00:32:44.231 --> 00:32:45.471
for almost eight years, right?

00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:47.991
Don't you get
how these power games work?

00:32:48.471 --> 00:32:49.951
They're setting you up.

00:32:50.671 --> 00:32:51.830
Don't do anything stupid.

00:33:10.671 --> 00:33:12.471
We got
Liang Xiaosong's apology statement.

00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:15.272
Great.

00:33:21.052 --> 00:33:22.664
(Completed by: Ren Jiatong, Jiang Chen,
Guo Xiaoyu, Huang Yue, and Li Ke)

00:33:30.671 --> 00:33:31.870
Good work.

00:33:32.471 --> 00:33:33.671
Mission accomplished, guys.

00:33:40.150 --> 00:33:41.590
- Mr. Zhou.
- Two proposals received.

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:42.711
Both submitted timely.

00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:44.590
Go have some rest now.

00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:46.511
Two?

00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:47.590
Yan Fei submitted hers?

00:33:48.031 --> 00:33:49.711
I haven't seen her all afternoon.

00:33:50.031 --> 00:33:50.830
She left early

00:33:51.191 --> 00:33:52.790
but submitted hers before closing time.

00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:54.856
Mr. Zhou.

00:33:54.856 --> 00:33:55.471
Look,

00:33:55.471 --> 00:33:57.310
we've been grinding all day

00:33:57.390 --> 00:33:58.790
to pass the assessment.

00:33:59.191 --> 00:34:01.110
How about treating us to dinner tonight?

00:34:01.671 --> 00:34:02.471
Unwind a bit.

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:04.590
You brat.

00:34:05.031 --> 00:34:06.031
Next time.

00:34:06.431 --> 00:34:07.191
I got a thing.

00:34:07.711 --> 00:34:08.750
Go easy on the drinks,

00:34:08.871 --> 00:34:09.431
and stay safe.

00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:10.791
Mr. Zhou!

00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:12.150
Mr. Zhou.

00:34:22.991 --> 00:34:23.528
What's this?

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:24.776
Mr. Zhou,

00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:26.150
we all think

00:34:26.311 --> 00:34:28.431
you broke up
with your girlfriend because of us.

00:34:28.991 --> 00:34:30.311
We want to make it right.

00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:36.150
Yan Fei provided this box.

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:39.590
I saw you retrieve the ring
and fiddle with it all day.

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:40.311
Put it inside.

00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:43.550
W-What's happening?

00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:44.871
Let me explain.

00:34:45.991 --> 00:34:47.230
First, Mr. Zhou,

00:34:47.511 --> 00:34:48.031
this is

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:50.230
your future wife's RedNote location.

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:51.550
She's at this bar right now.

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:52.791
Take a taxi there.

00:34:52.791 --> 00:34:53.710
It's a 10-minute ride.

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:54.991
The taxi's waiting downstairs.

00:34:55.351 --> 00:34:57.951
I've prepared confession poems for you

00:34:57.951 --> 00:34:59.511
to memorize during the ride.

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:00.232
Finally,

00:35:01.991 --> 00:35:02.710
the ring,

00:35:03.311 --> 00:35:05.190
roses,

00:35:05.590 --> 00:35:07.511
and her favorite teddy bear.

00:35:08.351 --> 00:35:11.031
Confess this time with these things.

00:35:11.311 --> 00:35:11.911
I guarantee

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:12.991
you'll definitely

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:14.270
win her back.

00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:15.511
Go, Mr. Zhou.

00:35:15.511 --> 00:35:16.991
- Go, Mr. Zhou!
- Get your girl.

00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:18.150
- Go.
- You can do this.

00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:22.351
Thanks, guys.

00:35:24.311 --> 00:35:25.070
- Go!
- Go!

00:35:26.031 --> 00:35:26.664
Go.

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:31.031
I vote for hotpot tonight.

00:35:31.951 --> 00:35:33.590
Then karaoke after eating.

00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:35.391
I have no appetite.

00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:36.872
So jealous.

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:38.110
What?

00:35:38.911 --> 00:35:41.031
(Xiaojie)
(Jiatong, why aren't you answering?)

00:35:41.031 --> 00:35:41.670
I bow my head?

00:35:41.791 --> 00:35:42.630
(Xiaojie)
Seriously?

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:44.391
(If you're busy, I'll contact your mom.)

00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:47.270
Should I text Mr. Zhou for updates?

00:35:47.311 --> 00:35:48.031
- Ask him...
- No!

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:50.590
No news means good news.

00:35:50.951 --> 00:35:52.311
They're happily dating now.

00:35:52.311 --> 00:35:53.270
Your call would ruin

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:54.270
their moment.

00:36:10.431 --> 00:36:11.511
Even my rom-coms don't do

00:36:11.511 --> 00:36:13.670
these cheesy rescue scenes anymore.

00:36:14.511 --> 00:36:16.630
Corny? Sure.

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:18.230
But weirdly addictive.

00:36:20.351 --> 00:36:21.311
Not joining them?

00:36:21.871 --> 00:36:23.431
Something came up. You go ahead.

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:27.351
Call if you

00:36:28.031 --> 00:36:28.590
need anything.

00:36:32.391 --> 00:36:32.911
What's funny?

00:36:33.831 --> 00:36:34.511
Nothing.

00:36:34.511 --> 00:36:35.590
She's not going with us.

00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:36.710
She's got something.

00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:38.230
What's wrong?

00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:40.391
She looks troubled.

00:36:41.391 --> 00:36:42.056
Xiaoyu.

00:36:42.351 --> 00:36:43.391
You live with her.

00:36:43.791 --> 00:36:46.070
Did she ever talk to you
about her family

00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:48.190
or her boyfriend?

00:36:48.991 --> 00:36:49.608
No.

00:36:49.791 --> 00:36:50.511
Why the curiosity?

00:36:50.511 --> 00:36:51.080
Let's go.

00:36:51.911 --> 00:36:52.590
No boyfriend.

00:36:53.431 --> 00:36:53.992
Let's go.

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:54.792
Go.

00:37:07.912 --> 00:37:08.424
(Total: 736
Pay: 731.2)

00:37:08.424 --> 00:37:09.630
The hotpot was delicious.

00:37:09.951 --> 00:37:10.871
Just way too expensive.

00:37:10.871 --> 00:37:11.831
Not doing this again.

00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:15.190
Jiang Chen paid the bill before he left.

00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:16.511
Let's split the cost with him.

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:19.471
Didn't we just get paid last week?

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:20.831
Time to treat ourselves.

00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:22.670
That's true in theory.

00:37:23.391 --> 00:37:24.710
But I never understood before.

00:37:25.311 --> 00:37:27.590
Now, I realize how hard
it is to earn money.

00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:30.511
And somehow in Beijing,
it's never enough.

00:37:30.951 --> 00:37:32.031
Last payday,

00:37:32.031 --> 00:37:33.190
I rushed eagerly to the mall,

00:37:33.791 --> 00:37:34.750
only to find my salary

00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:36.710
equivalent to one coat's price.

00:37:37.351 --> 00:37:38.710
That mentally hurt me.

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:39.911
Not only you.

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:40.991
My paycheck goes

00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:43.190
straight to the landlord.

00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:44.311
I can't tell

00:37:44.311 --> 00:37:45.511
whether I'm working for Jun An

00:37:45.511 --> 00:37:46.590
or that landlord.

00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:49.471
I actually find spending my own money

00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:50.471
pretty secure.

00:37:51.511 --> 00:37:53.190
Time flies.

00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:54.951
After the last round,

00:37:54.951 --> 00:37:56.871
all seven of us came
for hotpot together.

00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:59.110
Now, in the blink of an eye,
only four remain.

00:37:59.871 --> 00:38:02.911
When will we reunite
the Talent Hunt Seven Heroes?

00:38:03.831 --> 00:38:06.270
I just hope I don't get
eliminated this round.

00:38:06.511 --> 00:38:08.911
Even my breathing
reminds me to perform well.

00:38:09.791 --> 00:38:10.871
Oh, by the way,

00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:12.710
I came across Wang Lu's account

00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:14.150
on RedNote the other day.

00:38:14.871 --> 00:38:17.270
He's doing great at a boutique firm now.

00:38:17.511 --> 00:38:18.471
He started an account.

00:38:18.831 --> 00:38:19.464
Look,

00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:21.670
sharing lawyer fashion tips and stuff.

00:38:23.031 --> 00:38:24.471
(Wang Lu)
He has quite a few fans.

00:38:25.311 --> 00:38:25.871
Not bad.

00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:27.391
Truly nice.

00:38:27.391 --> 00:38:28.471
So getting eliminated

00:38:28.471 --> 00:38:29.670
isn't necessarily bad, right?

00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:31.230
Look how polished he is now,

00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:31.951
and look at us.

00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:32.951
Working on proposals

00:38:33.471 --> 00:38:35.230
nearly gave us heart attacks.

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:38.471
Where's Yan Fei?

00:38:39.031 --> 00:38:40.710
I haven't seen her all afternoon.

00:38:40.951 --> 00:38:41.951
Being all mysterious.

00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:42.991
Silent in the chat.

00:38:43.431 --> 00:38:43.951
Right,

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:45.150
she worked solo

00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:46.550
yet submitted her proposal so fast.

00:38:46.991 --> 00:38:48.070
How's she that good?

00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:49.351
Think about it.

00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:51.630
She worked on her proposal from home.

00:38:51.871 --> 00:38:52.831
Home. Come on.

00:38:53.351 --> 00:38:54.311
Of course she's good.

00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:55.590
This elimination

00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:57.070
will definitely be among us.

00:39:00.956 --> 00:39:05.576
(Theme: Sunday Pro Bono Legal Aid
Sign-up Link)

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:07.270
Will you...

00:39:09.871 --> 00:39:10.391
participate?

00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:24.136
Hello.

00:39:24.471 --> 00:39:26.871
Jiatong, the weather's getting colder.

00:39:27.031 --> 00:39:27.791
Dress warmly.

00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:33.710
You didn't answer this afternoon.

00:39:34.431 --> 00:39:36.670
They called me directly.

00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:38.070
Jiatong.

00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:39.710
Is everything okay?

00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.911
Yes.

00:39:42.351 --> 00:39:43.791
I was busy and didn't hear it.

00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:47.511
About that call,

00:39:47.511 --> 00:39:48.991
Lin saw it again.

00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:50.391
He gave me another lecture.

00:39:51.511 --> 00:39:52.031
Jiatong.

00:39:53.871 --> 00:39:55.471
Lin's startup

00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:57.471
is having some issues this month.

00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:58.710
Could you...?

00:39:59.911 --> 00:40:01.150
Could you transfer some

00:40:01.391 --> 00:40:02.391
of your salary to me?

00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:04.104
Okay.

00:40:04.471 --> 00:40:05.070
Later.

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:19.230
Hello?

00:40:19.991 --> 00:40:21.511
What are you up to, all secretive?

00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:22.710
You didn't even join us.

00:40:23.791 --> 00:40:24.511
Nothing.

00:40:27.911 --> 00:40:30.431
Jiang Chen specially bought this
and asked me to give it to you.

00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:32.471
Now, fess up.

00:40:33.110 --> 00:40:34.911
What's up with you two
being all secretive?

00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:37.230
It's nothing.

00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:43.150
I thought it was Zhubao.

00:40:44.311 --> 00:40:45.110
I'm heading back.

00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:46.351
Continue later.

00:40:46.951 --> 00:40:47.550
You should eat.

00:40:48.791 --> 00:40:49.351
Thanks.

00:40:49.471 --> 00:40:50.088
Not at all.

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:20.391
(Jiang Chen)
(You okay?)

00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:37.096
(Typing...)

00:41:39.991 --> 00:41:41.630
The girl's easily embarrassed.

00:41:42.471 --> 00:41:43.471
She's ignoring you.

00:41:43.911 --> 00:41:45.550
You go to her.

00:41:46.523 --> 00:41:47.304
(We killed people.)

00:41:47.304 --> 00:41:49.288
(Why keep doubting my love?)

00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:50.871
You don't understand girls.

00:41:56.351 --> 00:41:58.230
Be proactive. Ask her out.

00:41:58.911 --> 00:41:59.550
Wait.

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:01.391
Auntie, you're leaving comments here?

00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:04.190
I truly don't understand
you youngsters these days.

00:42:04.871 --> 00:42:06.710
I keep seeing people online saying

00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:08.871
dating isn't fun

00:42:08.871 --> 00:42:09.871
or that it's too hard.

00:42:10.351 --> 00:42:11.831
What's so difficult about it?

00:42:16.572 --> 00:42:17.480
(Red Envelope)

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:18.920
(I'm fine, thank you.)

00:42:19.471 --> 00:42:20.710
No hope for them.

00:42:22.511 --> 00:42:23.471
These two

00:42:23.951 --> 00:42:24.750
just aren't fated.

00:42:28.991 --> 00:42:29.608
Chen.

00:42:32.110 --> 00:42:33.190
Are you free tomorrow?

00:42:33.991 --> 00:42:35.670
Give your mom a video call.

00:42:35.791 --> 00:42:36.670
She misses you deeply.

00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:40.031
She called me today saying that.

00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:43.951
Actually,

00:42:45.070 --> 00:42:46.391
your mother's had it rough.

00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:49.190
You were young then

00:42:49.831 --> 00:42:51.991
and couldn't understand adult matters.

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:54.630
You're your mother's top priority.

00:42:58.831 --> 00:43:00.190
Maybe I don't understand,

00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:02.750
but they used to fight every day.

00:43:04.471 --> 00:43:05.710
Did they have time left for me?

00:43:08.311 --> 00:43:08.968
Going to bed.

00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:10.471
Sleep early.
