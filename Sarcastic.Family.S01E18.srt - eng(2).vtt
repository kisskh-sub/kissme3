00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.280
I don't feel like eating.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.799
Eat the breakfast I bought.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.040
Heavier than eating my wedding feast.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.599
You’re so harsh you curse yourself.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.639
Mom,

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:13.840
please don’t get me wrong.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.319
The breakfast you bought

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:16.840
is absolutely delicious.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.639
It’s on par with

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:18.439
Michelin.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.439
I’m just worried about my sales.

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:25.159
Your sales

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:26.879
have stably stayed at the bottom.

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:28.000
Haven’t you got used to it?

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:32.080
Bottom and zero are not the same.

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:33.840
Housing prices keep dropping lately.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.319
No one’s buying houses at all.

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:36.560
This year

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.840
I’ve already gone two months

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.199
without a single sale.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.879
You actually had sales before that?

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:45.520
Mom,

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:47.960
how can you say that?

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.759
Meng Hang is already suffering so much.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.439
As his future mother‑in‑law,

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.879
emotionally and logically,

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.960
shouldn’t you comfort him a bit?

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:56.240
Of course, of course, of course.

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:57.199
Of course.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.240
These housing prices,

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:00.439
for your sales,

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.919
the impact is only temporary.

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:02.400
Right.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.199
Right.

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:04.280
But your ability

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:06.479
hurts your sales forever.

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:09.439
Why are you adding fuel to the fire?

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.520
Agents need to be thick‑skinned.

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.400
Can’t handle even this blow,

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:14.800
then change careers.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:21.800
Just ignore her.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.639
She doesn’t know anything.

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:26.400
She knows everything.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.120
Let me tell you something.

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:35.400
When a baby eagle is born,

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.080
it can’t fly.

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:37.800
The eagle pushes it

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.080
off the cliff.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.919
While it is falling,

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:42.280
it learns how to fly.

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.879
That

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:43.319
is the

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:44.639
power of courage.

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:45.719
Now

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:47.199
go stand by the boss’s door,

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:48.360
I’ll give you a push too,

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:49.719
just like the eagle

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:51.800
pushing its chick off a cliff.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.240
Do you get what I mean?

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.759
Got it.

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.919
Good luck.

00:04:28.519 --> 00:04:29.319
Yeah, that’s it.

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:29.720
Hey,

00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:31.720
what are you doing?

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.879
No knock? You scared me!

00:04:33.399 --> 00:04:34.800
So rude, what’s wrong with you?

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:38.240
Manager, I knocked, you didn’t hear.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:39.399
Manager,

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:41.160
look at our phone app.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.439
Here’s a listing.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.800
Under this listing,

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:45.160
there’s a

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:46.879
“Contact agent” button.

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:48.040
Once you tap it,

00:04:48.519 --> 00:04:49.959
Old Cha is always the first.

00:04:50.519 --> 00:04:51.519
You scroll forever,

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:52.240
and then

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.920
get to the bottom,

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.920
then finally reach me.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:54.879
No wonder my

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:56.519
sales are so bad.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.639
Seriously?

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:58.319
Let me see.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.360
My wife used our app days ago

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.920
to look for houses.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000
When she clicked in,

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.439
on “contact agent,”

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:04.680
the first one to reply

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.920
was definitely Old Cha.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.800
She even boosted his metrics a lot.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.399
Do you think it could be

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.319
big data

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:15.800
guessing what she likes?

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.480
You?

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.519
You think you deserve that?

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.319
Lily,

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:40.480
likes

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:41.680
a guy like

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:43.399
you, a total scumbag?

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.439
Have you no

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.319
shame at all?

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:45.920
You—

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.199
What’s this,

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.279
you getting mad now?

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.879
What are you doing up there?

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.360
No,

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.199
this, this…

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.959
this…

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.959
No, this…

00:06:02.079 --> 00:06:03.759
Boss, why is there a fly in here?

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:05.079
You’re the one buzzing like a fly.

00:06:05.079 --> 00:06:05.959
Get down from there.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.279
What a day, such a show.

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:11.240
Manager.

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:12.399
About this list,

00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:15.240
it’s sorted by pinyin initials.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.519
Mine starts with C,

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:18.279
so it’s before any M, right?

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:21.720
C.

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:24.240
C-H-A,

00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:25.240
that’s a C.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.759
Z-H-A

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:28.920
is a Z.

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:30.800
Exactly.

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:32.560
C-H-A,

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:33.560
“Cha,” like my name.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.480
“Cha,”

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:40.399
“Cha.”

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:40.720
Fine.

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:42.720
Say you are a C.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.600
Then Old Bai in our company

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.480
should be a B.

00:06:45.519 --> 00:06:47.000
Why is he still behind you?

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.240
You must have

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.240
connections with the dev director

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.560
and got yourself moved up.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:55.399
That’s small-minded.

00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:56.639
You’re being petty.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.000
Your worldview’s too small.

00:06:58.439 --> 00:06:59.519
That’s straight-up slander.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.639
Old Bai

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.439
is an old Manchu.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.959
His original surname is

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.079
Guwalgiya.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.120
His G should come earlier,

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:08.800
so

00:07:08.959 --> 00:07:10.079
he’s listed right after me.

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:11.839
Then my English name is “Abandon” too.

00:07:12.079 --> 00:07:13.839
No one asked your English name.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:14.319
We’re talking about

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.040
All right, all right, enough.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:15.759
Stop arguing.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.560
Set up like this,

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.319
it does have issues.

00:07:21.439 --> 00:07:21.959
Here’s what we’ll do.

00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:24.839
I’ll talk to our colleagues

00:07:25.079 --> 00:07:25.800
in the dev department.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:26.920
Have them adjust it.

00:07:27.319 --> 00:07:27.920
I’ll make sure

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.680
every employee in the company

00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:31.160
appears on the front page equally.

00:07:31.519 --> 00:07:32.040
Happy now?

00:07:33.879 --> 00:07:34.720
Thanks, manager.

00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:41.079
Old Cha—

00:07:41.439 --> 00:07:42.399
C-H-A,

00:07:42.399 --> 00:07:43.040
Cha—

00:07:46.439 --> 00:07:47.560
you’re really such a “cha,” huh.

00:07:54.759 --> 00:07:55.319
You’re back.

00:07:56.079 --> 00:07:56.600
How did it go?

00:07:56.839 --> 00:07:58.199
Did you tell the manager?

00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:58.879
Yeah, I did.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.000
That’s the way.

00:08:00.319 --> 00:08:01.800
You must fight for it.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.560
Alexander the Great,

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.040
after he conquered Greece,

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:05.920
someone asked him,

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.079
“If you had the chance,

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.680
would you attack Persia?”

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:09.519
Guess what he said.

00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:11.360
He said, “You spoke Chinese,

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.399
I don’t understand.”

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:16.519
He said,

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.480
“I never wait for chances.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.680
I always create them myself.”

00:08:20.759 --> 00:08:22.399
Then he went and took Persia.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.680
See how inspiring that is?

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.040
Why the long face then?

00:08:29.639 --> 00:08:31.120
Did the manager fix it for you?

00:08:31.759 --> 00:08:32.879
Sort of.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.879
Don’t “sort of” me.

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:37.279
You must be precise in life.

00:08:37.639 --> 00:08:38.320
You know,

00:08:38.639 --> 00:08:40.840
there was a Soviet astronaut

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:42.759
who misread one decimal place.

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:44.559
The whole rocket exploded.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.759
Why do you keep rambling?

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.360
I’m not rambling.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:48.960
I’m just… just—

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.039
The manager said

00:08:52.519 --> 00:08:54.320
everyone will get equal time

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.879
on the platform’s front page.

00:08:56.159 --> 00:08:56.840
But guess what.

00:08:58.159 --> 00:08:59.519
All the prime locations

00:08:59.519 --> 00:09:00.320
belong to others.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.320
On my profile, all I list

00:09:03.159 --> 00:09:04.120
are old, shabby shoeboxes.

00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:06.039
I think

00:09:06.559 --> 00:09:07.279
this whole thing

00:09:07.799 --> 00:09:10.200
is because I complained

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:11.799
and pissed off the tech team.

00:09:12.519 --> 00:09:13.960
They’re screwing me on purpose.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.159
Don’t always assume the worst.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.519
Old dumps have perks too.

00:09:21.639 --> 00:09:22.679
They’re cheap.

00:09:22.759 --> 00:09:23.799
Small profit, big sales.

00:09:23.919 --> 00:09:24.399
Right?

00:09:24.559 --> 00:09:25.600
Once there was an old man,

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.559
his name was Sai Weng.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:27.360
One day,

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.279
his horse ran off.

00:09:28.279 --> 00:09:29.080
His mom ran off.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.440
Horse.

00:09:33.639 --> 00:09:35.000
What is up with you lately?

00:09:35.159 --> 00:09:37.320
You keep telling kiddie stories.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.399
Are you babysitting your boss’s kid

00:09:39.399 --> 00:09:40.519
and got side effects from it?

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.240
No.

00:09:44.639 --> 00:09:46.679
In my recent research on Earth,

00:09:46.679 --> 00:09:48.080
I made a big discovery.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.120
Humans have this thing

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:50.960
called “success studies.”

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.879
I never knew success was a science.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.639
It teaches people how to succeed.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:57.399
And this…

00:09:57.399 --> 00:09:58.440
is called “chicken soup” talk.

00:09:58.679 --> 00:10:00.000
Success gurus all read this.

00:10:00.279 --> 00:10:01.200
You should study it hard.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.600
Tell me, is this ceiling

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.440
leaking?

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.159
It leaks when it rains.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:26.879
It’s the top floor.

00:11:26.879 --> 00:11:28.080
What top floor doesn’t leak?

00:11:31.559 --> 00:11:32.799
The drains in this place

00:11:32.799 --> 00:11:33.720
stink.

00:11:34.399 --> 00:11:36.000
Old blocks all smell like that.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:36.600
Smell it.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.799
Then let’s see the bedroom.

00:11:43.919 --> 00:11:44.600
No need.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:45.679
No windows.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.279
Floor’s cracked too.

00:11:48.519 --> 00:11:49.559
This place has been

00:11:49.559 --> 00:11:51.639
listed with you for years.

00:11:51.759 --> 00:11:53.360
You never thought to fix it up?

00:11:53.639 --> 00:11:54.799
Who would fix this dump?

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.519
But it has one merit.

00:11:58.039 --> 00:11:58.840
It’s cheap.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:00.679
Cheap means poor quality.

00:12:03.519 --> 00:12:05.200
You’re brutally honest, huh?

00:12:05.399 --> 00:12:07.240
Honesty’s all I’ve got left.

00:12:08.399 --> 00:12:09.679
It even fell off.

00:12:10.879 --> 00:12:12.519
No wonder there’s a painting.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.679
It’s to cover the crack.

00:12:15.039 --> 00:12:17.039
Just admit it’s cracked,

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.559
why cover it up?

00:12:18.559 --> 00:12:19.200
So fake.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:20.799
I hate people like that most.

00:12:27.919 --> 00:12:29.000
This painting here...

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.960
I hung it up back in the day.

00:12:31.639 --> 00:12:32.559
Th-this...

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:33.440
You...

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.240
Back then,

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.440
I'd just graduated college.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.399
This was the first place I rented.

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:40.960
Now that I have money,

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.279
I wanted to buy it.

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.559
As a keepsake, you know.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:46.600
It's rare,

00:12:46.919 --> 00:12:48.440
this place is still the same.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:49.440
Oh, right.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.840
Isn't there a saying?

00:12:51.559 --> 00:12:52.919
No matter how far you go,

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.000
you must never forget

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.200
where you started from.

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.200
That sounds familiar.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.759
"Small Stories, Great Wisdom."

00:13:02.039 --> 00:13:03.279
Page two hundred fifty, right?

00:13:04.519 --> 00:13:05.799
You like self-help too?

00:13:05.919 --> 00:13:06.360
Yeah, yeah.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.200
We really click, huh.

00:13:07.639 --> 00:13:08.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.480
I read all of them.

00:13:09.679 --> 00:13:11.240
Reader, Bosom Friend, Yilin—

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:11.919
I love them all.

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.320
Yes, yes, those few books.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.240
Wait, so you...

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.360
You bought this place just as a keepsake?

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.200
It's just a bit of money.

00:13:21.039 --> 00:13:22.200
You know, young man,

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.080
you're pretty interesting.

00:13:23.639 --> 00:13:25.440
It's my first time seeing

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.919
an agent who doesn’t want to sell.

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.600
It’s not that I don’t want to.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.480
With a wise client like you,

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.600
I’d rather be honest.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.519
But still...

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:15.240
You’re back.

00:14:22.639 --> 00:14:24.200
What went wrong this time?

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:28.960
It’s nothing.

00:14:29.399 --> 00:14:29.919
Listen to me.

00:14:29.919 --> 00:14:31.120
What’s most precious in life

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.879
is the resolve to get things done.

00:14:33.519 --> 00:14:34.720
Let me tell you a story.

00:14:35.159 --> 00:14:37.559
They say Sima Guang couldn’t get up.

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:38.720
So later,

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:41.120
he drank a big vat of water

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:42.039
so that

00:14:42.039 --> 00:14:43.799
his full bladder woke him early.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.279
It forced him out of bed.

00:14:45.519 --> 00:14:46.320
And then?

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.120
He wet the bed.

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:48.879
So you knew that one.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.519
Then I’ll tell a different story.

00:14:51.519 --> 00:14:52.240
All right, enough.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:53.679
Thanks, really.

00:14:55.399 --> 00:14:57.000
Why so down?

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:58.960
Didn’t sell any?

00:14:59.879 --> 00:15:01.480
That’s not it.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.159
I did sell.

00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:06.320
How many?

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.159
Two units.

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:11.399
No.

00:15:12.919 --> 00:15:14.000
Twenty units.

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:15.080
No.

00:15:16.759 --> 00:15:18.440
Two hundred units.

00:15:18.639 --> 00:15:20.600
Where would I find that many?

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:22.440
Eighteen units.

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:23.919
Then you’re more of a fool—

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:26.879
than this guy is.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:28.960
It means

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.279
happy.

00:15:31.039 --> 00:15:32.799
I feel like opening your skull.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.159
You’re amazing.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:36.120
But this guy

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.559
bought 18 apartments at once.

00:15:37.559 --> 00:15:38.799
He must be loaded.

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:40.200
He wasn’t buying for himself.

00:15:40.519 --> 00:15:41.519
His company

00:15:41.519 --> 00:15:43.159
does asset allocation.

00:15:43.159 --> 00:15:44.279
Do you know asset allocation?

00:15:44.799 --> 00:15:45.279
No.

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:48.000
It means managing rich people’s money.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.159
For example,

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.000
you have twenty million.

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.320
How to spend it to make it grow?

00:15:53.919 --> 00:15:55.759
I top up my hot pot membership card.

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.200
Pay 200, get 50 extra.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.519
Then I’ve got twenty‑five million.

00:15:59.159 --> 00:16:00.480
All you know is eating.

00:16:01.279 --> 00:16:02.159
As for this boss,

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:02.679
first,

00:16:03.159 --> 00:16:04.759
he’s buying himself property.

00:16:04.759 --> 00:16:05.200
second,

00:16:05.399 --> 00:16:07.200
he’s testing reliable agents.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.960
And I passed his test.

00:16:09.759 --> 00:16:10.279
So these

00:16:10.279 --> 00:16:11.960
18 units all count as your sales?

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.480
Of course they count as mine.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.399
This intention contract

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:16.480
has been signed by the manager.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.879
You’re incredible.

00:16:19.159 --> 00:16:20.919
Meng Hang, I knew you’d make it.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:22.679
Edison

00:16:22.799 --> 00:16:25.000
failed over 20,000 times at the bulb.

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.399
Madame Curie, to extract radium,

00:16:26.399 --> 00:16:27.600
failed over 30,000 times.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.639
Our national team kept failing at the World Cup…

00:16:29.639 --> 00:16:30.679
Forget the national team.

00:16:30.679 --> 00:16:31.480
Don’t bring them up.

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:32.080
Okay.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.240
There’s one more thing.

00:16:34.679 --> 00:16:35.279
Well,

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:36.399
the company

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:39.000
wants me, at the quarterly review,

00:16:40.559 --> 00:16:41.559
to give a presentation,

00:16:42.039 --> 00:16:43.840
sharing how I succeeded.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.399
I don’t know what to say.

00:16:45.399 --> 00:16:47.200
Should I just turn it down?

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:48.440
Why turn it down?

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.480
Isn’t this a good thing?

00:16:49.919 --> 00:16:51.320
No, you don’t get it.

00:16:52.159 --> 00:16:53.960
The meeting’s at headquarters.

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.120
That means

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:57.000
speaking before thousands of people.

00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:58.320
That’s terrifying.

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.480
All the more reason to go.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.120
It’s clearly a sign of promoting you.

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:04.359
Your talent

00:17:04.519 --> 00:17:06.000
must be shown at HQ,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000
on a big stage like that,

00:17:07.039 --> 00:17:08.279
to really shine.

00:17:08.519 --> 00:17:09.559
Because the environment

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:10.960
decides how high you rise.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:11.880
You know?

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:12.880
There’s a kind of fly

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:13.839
that travels thousands of miles

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:16.079
from North America to scenic Australia.

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:17.119
Once they get there,

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:19.039
they just eat nectar and fruit.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.279
Later their offspring

00:17:20.279 --> 00:17:21.880
gradually evolve into bees.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.240
That inspirational story of yours

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.200
really defies basic biology.

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:27.640
Forget biology.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:29.160
We’re talking success theory now.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.359
If you want to succeed,

00:17:30.359 --> 00:17:31.960
you must seize this chance.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:34.359
I…

00:17:37.039 --> 00:17:37.839
can really do it?

00:17:38.599 --> 00:17:40.160
You definitely can.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:40.839
Come on.

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:41.319
Meng Hang,

00:17:41.319 --> 00:17:42.119
sit, sit, sit.

00:17:42.279 --> 00:17:42.759
I…

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:44.400
No, it’s just—

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.000
Sit.

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:46.880
You really don’t know.

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.279
Right from the start,

00:17:48.279 --> 00:17:50.160
I’ve rated your work ability highly.

00:17:50.359 --> 00:17:50.880
No,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:51.599
I mean,

00:17:51.599 --> 00:17:52.920
boss, don’t say that.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:53.640
Every single week,

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.119
sit down.

00:17:55.279 --> 00:17:56.599
at the weekly meeting,

00:17:57.039 --> 00:17:58.200
the one you single out

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.039
has always been me.

00:18:00.279 --> 00:18:00.880
Who says so?

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.559
I’ll pull up the records.

00:18:12.559 --> 00:18:13.119
Got it.

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.000
Second week of March last year.

00:18:15.119 --> 00:18:16.039
You weren’t the one I criticized.

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.039
It was Old Zha.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:19.599
Besides,

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:21.000
was I really criticizing you?

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.880
I was pushing you forward.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.440
Look at all the people in the firm.

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:25.799
Why don’t I criticize anyone else,

00:18:25.799 --> 00:18:26.599
only you?

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:28.440
It’s because I have

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.319
high hopes for you.

00:18:31.799 --> 00:18:32.960
You know that saying, right?

00:18:33.079 --> 00:18:35.279
“When heaven gives someone a great task,

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:36.799
it first drives them insane”—

00:18:37.119 --> 00:18:37.519
no, that’s not it.

00:18:38.359 --> 00:18:39.200
First it has to… you know—

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:41.880
you get what I mean.

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:42.359
Right?

00:18:43.759 --> 00:18:44.359
Right.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:45.839
So,

00:18:46.079 --> 00:18:47.000
you’ve actually been

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000
testing me all along.

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.799
Of course.

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.119
Think about it:

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.839
your numbers have always been last,

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.039
yet I’ve still kept you on.

00:18:54.039 --> 00:18:54.960
I never fired you.

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:56.160
That’s obviously because

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.240
I’m a thousand-li horse

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.880
who spotted you, my talent scout—

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:00.000
no, wait—

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.359
I mean I’m the talent scout—

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:02.519
I’m the… whatever.

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:06.400
Anyway,

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.079
when you give your talk at HQ,

00:19:08.119 --> 00:19:10.160
you can work some of this in.

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.240
Say how much I’ve influenced you.

00:19:13.079 --> 00:19:14.640
This isn’t mandatory,

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:15.359
just

00:19:15.359 --> 00:19:16.920
a little suggestion from me.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:17.559
All right.

00:19:17.599 --> 00:19:18.000
Got it.

00:19:18.119 --> 00:19:18.480
Got it.

00:19:19.039 --> 00:19:19.720
Yeah, got it.

00:19:59.279 --> 00:20:00.079
How does it feel?

00:20:00.319 --> 00:20:00.839
Brother Meng.

00:20:01.119 --> 00:20:02.400
I hung it up there myself.

00:20:03.039 --> 00:20:04.960
I wanted to put a famous quote on it.

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:06.079
In some artsy font.

00:20:06.119 --> 00:20:07.359
But the system couldn’t read it.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:08.640
I’ll change the quote later.

00:20:09.079 --> 00:20:10.200
This was arranged by the manager.

00:20:11.039 --> 00:20:14.119
This was arranged by all of us.

00:20:14.799 --> 00:20:15.799
Sales champion this year,

00:20:15.799 --> 00:20:16.680
it has to be you.

00:20:17.079 --> 00:20:19.359
You’re the model of our whole station.

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:20.839
But this…

00:20:20.839 --> 00:20:22.119
Just doing one photo

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:23.519
is really a bit plain.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:24.319
Later on,

00:20:24.319 --> 00:20:26.160
I’ll custom‑make you a

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:26.880
life‑size standee.

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:27.319
We’ll put it right here.

00:20:27.599 --> 00:20:28.079
No, no, no.

00:20:28.279 --> 00:20:29.279
That’s too much, really.

00:20:29.519 --> 00:20:30.079
Brother Meng,

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.160
when you’re a leader later,

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.319
don’t forget your little bro.

00:20:34.839 --> 00:20:36.000
Me, a leader? Come on.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:36.960
That’s not happening.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.079
You’re going to speak at HQ.

00:20:39.319 --> 00:20:40.920
Even our chief never got that.

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.000
If you’re not a leader, who is?

00:20:43.119 --> 00:20:43.599
Brother Meng,

00:20:43.759 --> 00:20:45.359
do you know why I used to

00:20:45.359 --> 00:20:47.400
always push the hardest jobs to you?

00:20:50.039 --> 00:20:50.920
You were dumping work on me.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:52.000
True.

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.119
I am indeed a “handsome guy.”

00:20:56.119 --> 00:20:56.759
Not funny, huh?

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:57.319
No.

00:20:57.599 --> 00:20:58.079
Smile.

00:20:58.920 --> 00:20:59.279
Smile.

00:20:59.480 --> 00:20:59.920
Smile.

00:21:00.279 --> 00:21:01.039
All this time,

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:03.440
we’ve been grooming you as a leader.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:04.319
So

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.440
all the tricky problems

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.640
were given for you to solve.

00:21:06.799 --> 00:21:07.279
Wait, what?

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.200
Since when did you guys

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.079
start grooming me as a leader?

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.680
We always have been.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.119
And it’s like an elevator—

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.359
a straight vertical promotion.

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.160
Our whole station

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:18.400
knows you’re the next chief.

00:21:18.599 --> 00:21:20.920
You’re the only one who doesn’t.

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.200
Know why?

00:21:24.839 --> 00:21:26.079
Your biggest flaw

00:21:26.079 --> 00:21:27.400
is you lack confidence.

00:21:28.039 --> 00:21:28.920
You haven’t realized

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.640
how good you are inside.

00:21:33.079 --> 00:21:34.160
How am I “good” at all?

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.839
You’re good in every way.

00:21:37.519 --> 00:21:38.319
Spell it out then.

00:21:38.319 --> 00:21:38.880
Here’s the thing.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.119
If people praise you,

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.079
it means they see your value.

00:21:42.279 --> 00:21:43.640
If they criticize you,

00:21:43.759 --> 00:21:45.559
they’re jealous of your value.

00:21:47.119 --> 00:21:47.720
Old Zha,

00:21:48.279 --> 00:21:49.400
that life‑size standee—

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:50.680
we must change the photo.

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:51.039
Okay.

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:53.000
This one’s way too ugly.

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:54.480
My bad.

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.200
I was just jealous of you.

00:21:56.279 --> 00:21:57.640
So I made it ugly on purpose.

00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:58.559
I’ll definitely fix it.

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:04.000
Here's how things stand now.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:06.519
As long as Meng Hang nails this report,

00:22:06.519 --> 00:22:07.799
he'll definitely get promoted.

00:22:08.039 --> 00:22:09.240
But right now,

00:22:09.519 --> 00:22:10.720
he just has no confidence.

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:11.759
He keeps thinking

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:12.680
he’s only come this far

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:13.680
because of pure luck.

00:22:13.799 --> 00:22:14.640
So we

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:15.680
have really got to help him

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:16.559
build up his confidence.

00:22:18.519 --> 00:22:19.759
With his abilities?

00:22:20.119 --> 00:22:22.599
What good is confidence even then?

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.119
How can you say that?

00:22:24.119 --> 00:22:25.759
His skills are actually quite good.

00:22:25.839 --> 00:22:27.359
And how is that useless?

00:22:27.839 --> 00:22:28.960
Have you ever heard

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:30.119
the story of the charm?

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:31.160
No.

00:22:31.759 --> 00:22:33.000
Let me tell you then.

00:22:33.359 --> 00:22:34.920
Once there was a mother

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.880
whose son was going off to war.

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:38.720
She gave him a little pouch

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:39.519
and told him,

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:40.480
"Inside here

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.720
is a protective charm.

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:42.640
It will make you

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:43.880
immune to swords and bullets.

00:22:44.039 --> 00:22:45.440
But you must never open it."

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.119
So the son

00:22:47.119 --> 00:22:48.839
went to war wearing the charm.

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:49.279
Sure enough,

00:22:49.599 --> 00:22:50.880
he won every battle.

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:52.200
Until one day

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.279
curiosity made him open it, and he saw

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:55.880
it was empty—

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:56.880
nothing inside at all.

00:22:57.279 --> 00:22:58.599
And just like that,

00:22:58.599 --> 00:22:59.640
his confidence collapsed.

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:01.559
Next day in battle again,

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:02.799
he was cut down by the enemy.

00:23:03.359 --> 00:23:04.160
So tell me,

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.799
what does this story mean?

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:07.680
It means if you don’t listen to Mom,

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:08.599
you’ll get hacked to death.

00:23:09.039 --> 00:23:09.880
Your comprehension is terrible.

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:10.559
Next.

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:12.319
It, uh, means…

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.000
it means the mom was too stingy.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:14.920
A protective charm,

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:15.440
and she makes a fake one?

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:16.359
That’s totally messing with him.

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.200
That’s definitely not it.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.039
You’re no better.

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.440
This story shows

00:23:20.519 --> 00:23:22.640
people must have confidence.

00:23:22.839 --> 00:23:23.720
These next few days,

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.079
we’ve got to treat Meng Hang well,

00:23:25.079 --> 00:23:26.680
so he can seize this chance.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.039
Don’t we usually treat him

00:23:28.039 --> 00:23:29.279
pretty well already?

00:23:29.279 --> 00:23:29.839
Yeah, we do.

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:31.400
You do?

00:23:46.119 --> 00:23:47.480
Seriously?

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:48.400
Sorry.

00:23:50.599 --> 00:23:51.880
That’s for wiping your butt.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.000
You can’t wipe the piano with it.

00:23:53.319 --> 00:23:54.119
Use this to wipe it.

00:23:55.839 --> 00:23:56.480
Honestly…

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.160
Your shoulder, your shoulder.

00:24:13.519 --> 00:24:14.680
Mom, especially you—

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:16.240
these days you really have to

00:24:16.319 --> 00:24:17.119
say nice things about him.

00:24:17.519 --> 00:24:19.319
I don’t know how to praise people.

00:24:19.559 --> 00:24:21.519
Not scolding him is my limit.

00:24:21.759 --> 00:24:22.839
Think about it:

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.160
once you praise him,

00:24:24.279 --> 00:24:25.279
he gains confidence.

00:24:25.599 --> 00:24:26.480
With confidence,

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:27.440
he gets promoted.

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:28.480
Once he’s promoted,

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:29.279
he’s happy.

00:24:29.279 --> 00:24:29.839
When he’s happy,

00:24:29.839 --> 00:24:31.519
he’ll take the whole family traveling.

00:24:32.599 --> 00:24:33.680
To Antarctica.

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:34.960
How does that sound?

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:38.400
All right.

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:39.240
I’ll do my best.

00:24:39.279 --> 00:24:40.039
See?

00:24:40.319 --> 00:24:42.000
I finally found what we share.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.119
I like cold places too.

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:43.599
How about this:

00:24:43.799 --> 00:24:45.440
we go to Mohe, okay?

00:24:45.799 --> 00:24:46.640
You go to Mohe.

00:24:47.039 --> 00:24:47.960
I’ll go to Antarctica.

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:49.640
Who’s traveling with you?

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.119
Going to Mohe costs so little.

00:24:51.119 --> 00:24:52.119
Antarctica costs a fortune.

00:24:52.119 --> 00:24:53.519
Then… wouldn’t I be losing out?

00:24:53.559 --> 00:24:53.880
Then…

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.279
Then you can go to the black zone.

00:24:55.279 --> 00:24:56.440
You can’t return without 2–3 million.

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:57.240
Then you won’t lose out.

00:24:57.319 --> 00:24:58.279
Then why don’t you go?

00:24:58.720 --> 00:24:59.839
I’m not going to Mohe.

00:24:59.839 --> 00:25:00.279
All right.

00:25:00.319 --> 00:25:00.680
Enough.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:02.440
When the time comes, you two

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:03.319
can go wherever you like.

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:04.920
Our top priority right now

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:07.160
is to help Meng Hang build confidence.

00:25:08.359 --> 00:25:09.119
I’m back.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.279
The big leader’s back!

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:12.200
Say what?

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:13.359
Why did you kick me?

00:25:13.559 --> 00:25:14.640
The big leader’s back.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.200
Aren’t you giving up your seat?

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:17.920
Yes.

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:18.680
Right.

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:19.720
Sit.

00:25:20.759 --> 00:25:22.000
Sit, sit, hurry and sit.

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:24.039
Sit, Dad, sit.

00:25:24.039 --> 00:25:24.559
Sit, sit, sit.

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:25.559
What’s that supposed to mean?

00:25:26.079 --> 00:25:27.720
We were just talking about you.

00:25:27.759 --> 00:25:28.680
Go on.

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:29.519
Without you in this home,

00:25:29.519 --> 00:25:30.960
look, it doesn’t even run.

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:31.880
No, that’s not it.

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:32.880
You, seriously…

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.680
are you praising me or insulting me?

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.160
Why do I feel there’s subtext there?

00:25:36.319 --> 00:25:37.559
W-what were you saying about me?

00:25:38.359 --> 00:25:38.599
Well…

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:39.519
Say it.

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:41.720
I heard you got promoted this time

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.160
purely on your own ability.

00:25:44.279 --> 00:25:45.000
That’s right.

00:25:45.039 --> 00:25:47.400
Not a bit of luck involved.

00:25:48.519 --> 00:25:49.359
Probably, yeah.

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:50.720
Look at the store manager—

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:52.319
he saw this coming long ago.

00:25:53.079 --> 00:25:54.200
When he heard you got promoted,

00:25:55.559 --> 00:25:57.519
he was happier than at dad’s misdiagnosis.

00:25:58.039 --> 00:25:58.519
Well…

00:25:58.519 --> 00:25:59.720
I kind of think so too.

00:26:01.359 --> 00:26:02.799
See? He’s pretty confident.

00:26:03.119 --> 00:26:04.880
Keep buttering him up, keep going.

00:26:05.119 --> 00:26:05.839
Today,

00:26:06.119 --> 00:26:07.519
the manager told my coworkers

00:26:07.839 --> 00:26:09.079
that from the very beginning

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:10.480
he’d been grooming me

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:11.559
according to this

00:26:11.559 --> 00:26:13.039
future leader track

00:26:13.039 --> 00:26:13.960
all along.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:16.559
Didn’t expect you to notice that.

00:26:16.799 --> 00:26:18.839
The whole world can see it.

00:26:18.839 --> 00:26:19.359
Really?

00:26:19.839 --> 00:26:21.039
You’re not just a leader at work;

00:26:21.279 --> 00:26:22.640
you’re the head of this family too.

00:26:24.079 --> 00:26:24.920
Some people

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:25.880
just can’t ever seem

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.279
to find their own place.

00:26:27.279 --> 00:26:28.799
You should criticize her when needed.

00:26:28.839 --> 00:26:29.640
Right? You…

00:26:30.039 --> 00:26:30.839
Right, Leader?

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.359
Honestly, I think you

00:26:33.359 --> 00:26:34.400
should now focus on

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:35.000
our

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.200
spiritual development.

00:26:36.759 --> 00:26:37.440
For example,

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:38.799
organize

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:40.799
a trip to Antarctica or something.

00:26:40.799 --> 00:26:41.920
Isn’t that a bit rushed?

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:44.480
Depends on my son’s mood.

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:46.039
Your son got promoted,

00:26:46.039 --> 00:26:48.039
what are you strutting around for?

00:26:48.119 --> 00:26:49.039
Showing off on his coattails.

00:26:49.039 --> 00:26:50.559
Isn’t he a sly old fox?

00:26:51.559 --> 00:26:52.240
You two, you two—

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:53.559
sit down, sit down.

00:26:53.559 --> 00:26:54.279
I don’t want to sit with him.

00:26:54.279 --> 00:26:55.119
Come on, come on.

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:55.440
Um…

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:56.559
Mom, lean on me, sit next to me.

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.240
Let me say a few words.

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:04.440
Before this,

00:27:04.839 --> 00:27:06.960
my self‑awareness

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:07.960
and place

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.079
was off.

00:27:09.839 --> 00:27:10.599
So,

00:27:11.119 --> 00:27:13.119
I didn’t step up to lead the family.

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:14.279
That’s on me.

00:27:14.839 --> 00:27:15.680
From today on,

00:27:16.039 --> 00:27:16.880
I will definitely

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:18.519
run this family

00:27:18.599 --> 00:27:19.799
properly and

00:27:20.119 --> 00:27:20.839
take charge.

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:23.359
Mom,

00:27:24.039 --> 00:27:25.000
let me say something to you.

00:27:26.039 --> 00:27:29.000
Stop stirring up fights in the family.

00:27:30.079 --> 00:27:30.960
That’s not good.

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:33.880
A peaceful home brings everything.

00:27:34.319 --> 00:27:34.880
Exactly.

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.079
Watch Ni Ping’s shows more

00:27:37.079 --> 00:27:37.680
often when you’re free.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:39.680
They’re great.

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:41.039
Dad,

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:42.680
same goes for you.

00:27:42.839 --> 00:27:43.319
Don’t just

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:44.279
talk and do nothing.

00:27:44.359 --> 00:27:45.720
Get moving.

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:46.279
For example,

00:27:46.279 --> 00:27:47.440
that bowl in the kitchen,

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:48.559
wash it later, okay?

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:49.240
Go on.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:51.680
Lili,

00:27:52.039 --> 00:27:53.359
you’ve been reading well lately.

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:54.519
You’ve read a lot of books.

00:27:54.799 --> 00:27:55.519
That’s worth praise.

00:27:56.839 --> 00:27:58.400
About that speech I asked for,

00:27:58.400 --> 00:27:59.200
get it done, yeah?

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.119
Okay, everyone, let’s move.

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:07.279
Get moving.

00:28:12.319 --> 00:28:13.559
Nice, that’s the spirit.

00:28:13.599 --> 00:28:15.559
He’s adjusting pretty fast.

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:18.039
Yeah.

00:28:18.039 --> 00:28:19.759
Faster than I expected.

00:28:22.759 --> 00:28:23.880
Comrade Li Lili,

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:26.839
what is this speech about?

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:28.640
It’s like a story magazine.

00:28:29.759 --> 00:28:32.839
These are all handpicked stories.

00:28:33.279 --> 00:28:33.960
Look,

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.960
first you went to the boss

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.440
and I used the eagle story to cheer you up.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:39.359
Then

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:40.559
“a blessing in disguise,”

00:28:40.599 --> 00:28:42.279
everything is the best arrangement.

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:43.200
And in the end

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.359
you never give up,

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:45.720
like that old lady long ago

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:46.400
with a big iron rod

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:46.880
grinding away every day, ka—

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:47.920
Okay, okay, enough.

00:28:48.559 --> 00:28:50.359
These stories are ancient clichés.

00:28:51.039 --> 00:28:52.640
Are you overdosing on chicken soup?

00:28:53.279 --> 00:28:55.279
How is that “overdosing on chicken soup”?

00:28:55.599 --> 00:28:58.000
If I hadn’t used success theory

00:28:58.079 --> 00:29:00.200
to teach you to fight the boss,

00:29:00.359 --> 00:29:02.000
would you be this successful now?

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.279
What’s that got to do with you?

00:29:04.799 --> 00:29:06.079
Didn’t I tell you?

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:09.119
The manager’s been grooming me as a leader.

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:10.039
My coworkers,

00:29:10.039 --> 00:29:11.519
your mom, my dad included,

00:29:12.559 --> 00:29:14.240
all see how outstanding I am.

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:16.079
What’s that got to do with your stories?

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:17.880
They’re too cheesy.

00:29:21.079 --> 00:29:23.000
I used to think you lacked confidence.

00:29:23.799 --> 00:29:24.559
But now I feel

00:29:24.559 --> 00:29:26.759
you’re a bit too full of yourself.

00:29:27.759 --> 00:29:28.480
Criticizing me,

00:29:28.519 --> 00:29:29.240
right?

00:29:29.599 --> 00:29:30.759
People who criticize me

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.240
are either insecure

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:34.440
or

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:35.759
jealous

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.039
of how great I am.

00:29:37.839 --> 00:29:38.480
Me,

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:39.599
jealous of you?

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:42.200
Fine.

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:43.519
Then I’m out.

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:44.559
You figure it out yourself.

00:29:44.839 --> 00:29:46.240
Write it yourself then.

00:30:00.759 --> 00:30:01.160
This…

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:02.839
It’s already full, this…

00:30:14.079 --> 00:30:15.119
Respected

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:16.160
leaders,

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:17.440
dear friends,

00:30:18.119 --> 00:30:19.559
and all who fight on

00:30:19.559 --> 00:30:22.039
the front line of property sales—

00:30:22.119 --> 00:30:22.960
What are you reading?

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:23.400
You.

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:26.920
A speech.

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:28.480
I’m about to head

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:30.119
to HQ to report in.

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:32.319
No need to go.

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:33.880
Just stay here and work.

00:30:37.039 --> 00:30:37.640
Why?

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:38.559
Why?

00:30:38.759 --> 00:30:40.480
That deal died. Why else?

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.200
Eighteen deals,

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:44.240
all gone.

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:45.279
Nineteen.

00:30:45.519 --> 00:30:47.039
Even that first crappy unit

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:47.799
was canceled.

00:30:49.279 --> 00:30:49.599
No way.

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:50.200
How come?

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:51.920
D-did you talk to the client?

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.039
If you want to talk,

00:30:53.039 --> 00:30:54.480
book a visit at the detention center.

00:30:54.839 --> 00:30:55.519
He’s in.

00:30:55.759 --> 00:30:56.559
Tax evasion.

00:30:58.279 --> 00:30:58.599
Then…

00:30:58.640 --> 00:30:59.599
the deposit he paid—

00:30:59.839 --> 00:31:01.240
does that count as my sales?

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:02.839
You’re still thinking of that?

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.279
If we don’t refund it,

00:31:04.359 --> 00:31:06.279
you want the firm investigated too?

00:31:07.359 --> 00:31:09.599
Be glad you’re not in trouble.

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:10.839
“Your sales,” huh.

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:12.400
What goes on in your head?

00:31:12.799 --> 00:31:13.119
Meng Hang,

00:31:13.119 --> 00:31:14.960
you really need to self-reflect.

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:17.240
Look at the kind of clients you find.

00:31:18.799 --> 00:31:19.559
Then again,

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:21.799
your professional skills

00:31:21.799 --> 00:31:22.799
are plain for all to see—

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:23.720
you’re just not good.

00:31:24.759 --> 00:31:25.240
But didn’t you…

00:31:25.359 --> 00:31:27.200
say I was a real dark horse?

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:28.279
Dark horse my foot.

00:31:28.279 --> 00:31:30.079
I just want you a thousand miles away.

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:31.680
Why are you still standing here?

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:32.960
Get out and find clients.

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:36.079
Okay, okay, got it.

00:31:36.559 --> 00:31:38.240
You slack off all day long.

00:31:38.519 --> 00:31:40.039
You’re bottom again this month.

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:42.480
And that photo—

00:31:42.559 --> 00:31:43.440
take it down.

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:45.960
Meng—

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.240
these two are clients

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:49.640
you can sign if you go.

00:31:49.839 --> 00:31:50.880
Hurry and close them.

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:52.200
Don’t say

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:53.599
handsome bro never helps you.

00:31:55.279 --> 00:31:55.839
I’m off.

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:54.599
You’re back.

00:33:00.039 --> 00:33:01.160
Sold another place?

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.920
How many units today?

00:33:05.839 --> 00:33:06.720
Well…

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:10.680
it’s just…

00:33:11.039 --> 00:33:12.240
about before—

00:33:13.799 --> 00:33:14.799
I was wrong.

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:19.279
I did get a bit swollen-headed.

00:33:19.319 --> 00:33:21.480
I’ve treated you badly lately.

00:33:22.599 --> 00:33:23.400
I’m sorry.

00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:26.400
What’s up, Meng Hang?

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:27.880
Suddenly so self-aware?

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:29.440
I…

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:30.759
uh…

00:33:32.799 --> 00:33:33.960
that big deal fell through,

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:36.640
and the promotion’s gone.

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:39.279
I’ve let you down.

00:33:47.559 --> 00:33:47.960
This

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:50.680
You didn't have to hack at me.

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:54.519
I already knew you blew your promotion.

00:33:54.839 --> 00:33:55.559
Thanks to me,

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:56.400
I came prepared.

00:33:56.599 --> 00:33:57.240
No, hold up, you—

00:33:57.559 --> 00:33:57.920
You—

00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:58.880
How did you even know?

00:33:59.359 --> 00:34:01.119
Your client made the news.

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:04.240
Then why are you holding an axe?

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.920
I wanna tell you a story.

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:09.800
When Washington was a kid,

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:12.480
he loved his uncle’s axe.

00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:13.159
No, wait—

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:14.280
it was his dad’s.

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:15.119
Not his uncle’s.

00:34:17.519 --> 00:34:19.519
He really loved his dad’s axe.

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:20.679
One day,

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:22.440
he secretly took the axe out

00:34:22.519 --> 00:34:24.599
and chopped the tree at his gate.

00:34:24.599 --> 00:34:25.440
The cherry tree.

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:28.360
Stop reading pirated books, okay?

00:34:29.199 --> 00:34:31.039
So you know that story?

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:33.400
Then you know where I’m going.

00:34:33.719 --> 00:34:35.280
You’re reading the rip‑off version.

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:36.719
I, uh, I—

00:34:36.719 --> 00:34:37.840
I don’t dare just guess.

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:40.039
Then let me keep going.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.239
Later Washington felt

00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:43.679
that what he’d done was wrong.

00:34:44.039 --> 00:34:46.280
So he confessed to his dad.

00:34:46.719 --> 00:34:48.559
His dad not only forgave him,

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:50.039
he even took the axe

00:34:50.039 --> 00:34:51.000
and gave it to him.

00:34:51.519 --> 00:34:52.079
No, no—

00:34:55.639 --> 00:34:56.800
W‑what do you mean?

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:57.639
So that means

00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:58.440
you’ve

00:34:59.199 --> 00:34:59.880
forgiven me?

00:35:01.519 --> 00:35:03.039
Forgive you, sure.

00:35:03.599 --> 00:35:04.480
But what you did

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:05.800
will pop back up in our

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:06.920
next fight as evidence.

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:09.480
Then I’ll keep this axe on me

00:35:09.559 --> 00:35:10.559
all the time,

00:35:11.719 --> 00:35:12.559
to remind myself

00:35:12.639 --> 00:35:13.599
not to get cocky again.

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:16.159
Thanks.

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:24.480
How about...

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:25.960
you just put the axe down?

00:35:26.239 --> 00:35:28.239
My neck feels icy right now.

00:35:29.519 --> 00:35:30.079
Okay.

00:35:44.039 --> 00:35:45.760
I read a story lately.

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:48.599
It was about young Leonardo learning art.

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:50.639
His teacher made him draw eggs daily.

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.320
He really didn’t get it.

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:54.119
The teacher told him,

00:35:54.679 --> 00:35:55.840
“In this world,

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:57.880
no two eggs are identical.

00:35:58.440 --> 00:35:59.639
If you can notice

00:35:59.639 --> 00:36:01.480
their tiniest differences,

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:03.159
then whatever you paint later

00:36:03.159 --> 00:36:04.400
will be a breeze for you.”

00:36:05.559 --> 00:36:07.559
Da Vinci suddenly got it.

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.440
He trained hard every day

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:11.920
and became a true master.

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:13.920
That story

00:36:14.079 --> 00:36:16.000
really inspired me.

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:17.000
I feel like

00:36:17.079 --> 00:36:18.119
observing Earth

00:36:18.159 --> 00:36:19.199
is the same thing.

00:36:19.679 --> 00:36:20.239
So,

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:21.000
I’ve decided

00:36:21.039 --> 00:36:22.079
that from now on, each issue

00:36:22.679 --> 00:36:23.920
I’ll study this globe.

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:25.719
I’ll examine it a thousand times.

00:36:26.039 --> 00:36:27.880
If Earth has any problem later,

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:29.440
I’ll spot it in a second.

00:36:30.519 --> 00:36:31.480
Li Lili.

00:36:31.679 --> 00:36:33.039
Are you slacking off?

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:34.719
No.

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:36.000
I’m touching Earth.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:36.559
See?

00:36:37.519 --> 00:36:38.599
You’ve got two options.

00:36:39.079 --> 00:36:40.880
Either you ditch that junky globe,

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:42.880
or you ditch this job.

00:36:44.039 --> 00:36:44.519
Chief Editor,

00:36:44.559 --> 00:36:46.159
I swear I’m not slacking.

00:36:46.599 --> 00:36:48.159
I’m just really moved.

00:36:48.199 --> 00:36:49.039
This is all

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:50.320
truly from the heart.

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:51.039
That—

00:36:51.039 --> 00:36:52.280
Just shut up.

00:36:52.719 --> 00:36:53.519
Before tonight,

00:36:53.519 --> 00:36:55.280
turn in a 20,000‑word report.

00:36:56.079 --> 00:36:57.920
Hey, that’s not so bad… right?
