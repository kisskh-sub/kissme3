What's the hold-up?

00:01:35.408 --> 00:01:37.410
God, look at the time.

00:01:58.348 --> 00:02:01.434
The number you've called isn't available.
You'll be directed to--

00:02:01.935 --> 00:02:04.229
AN YUN-SU (HOME)

00:02:07.065 --> 00:02:09.567
She's been on the phone for so long.

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:15.073
All right, I'm going.

00:02:41.474 --> 00:02:44.477
You can't just jump out of nowhere
when it's a red light.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.188
Especially dressed in black.

00:02:48.022 --> 00:02:51.067
Oh my, are you all right?

00:02:53.236 --> 00:02:54.070
Oh dear.

00:02:55.738 --> 00:02:56.656
Hey.

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.618
Wait, you can't just leave!
Hey! Are you sure you're all right?

00:03:01.411 --> 00:03:02.412
Oh man!

00:03:26.644 --> 00:03:28.730
What's she up to?

00:03:29.814 --> 00:03:31.816
Ms. An!

00:03:36.696 --> 00:03:38.114
Ms. An!

00:03:40.408 --> 00:03:41.909
Ms. An!

00:03:43.828 --> 00:03:45.788
Ms. An!

00:04:27.538 --> 00:04:29.248
Hi, this is Bae Sun-deok.

00:04:29.332 --> 00:04:32.919
I've just arrived at Ms. An's house.

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.588
Her cellphone is inside,

00:04:36.381 --> 00:04:38.132
but I don't see her.

00:04:38.841 --> 00:04:39.842
Yeah.

00:04:40.927 --> 00:04:42.387
Please call the police for now.

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.056
When they get here,
we'll pick the lock and enter.

00:04:45.807 --> 00:04:46.808
I'm not sure.

00:04:47.433 --> 00:04:48.601
For now,

00:04:49.727 --> 00:04:51.396
I just hope she's in there.

00:04:55.775 --> 00:04:56.692
You're here.

00:04:59.237 --> 00:05:02.323
Oh, Ms. An is at home.

00:05:02.407 --> 00:05:03.825
Yes, I'm with her right now.

00:05:03.908 --> 00:05:06.452
There's no need to call the police.

00:05:10.706 --> 00:05:12.375
I dozed off in the bath.

00:05:12.458 --> 00:05:14.794
I haven't had one since the ankle monitor.

00:05:14.877 --> 00:05:16.963
Since it was broken,
I was going to take a short bath.

00:05:17.046 --> 00:05:18.214
-Ms. An.
-But I fell asleep.

00:05:18.297 --> 00:05:20.633
-I jolted awake at the banging sound.
-Ms. An?

00:05:22.718 --> 00:05:23.845
You're bleeding.

00:05:24.929 --> 00:05:26.013
Are you okay?

00:05:27.014 --> 00:05:28.516
Yes, I'm fine.

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:32.353
Go put on a bandage.
Clean yourself up a bit too.

00:05:32.854 --> 00:05:33.688
But I'm fine.

00:05:33.771 --> 00:05:36.482
No, it looks sore. Go on.

00:05:36.566 --> 00:05:38.067
I'll be back in a minute.

00:05:42.822 --> 00:05:43.948
Do you need some help?

00:05:45.324 --> 00:05:46.325
No.

00:05:46.826 --> 00:05:48.327
It's okay.

00:07:20.628 --> 00:07:22.588
Oh, Sop did that.

00:07:23.089 --> 00:07:25.132
I guess she didn't like the look of it.

00:07:27.885 --> 00:07:29.053
I wish they didn't know

00:07:30.179 --> 00:07:33.975
about grown-up stuff,
but somehow they always do, don't they?

00:07:35.142 --> 00:07:36.394
Tell me about it.

00:07:38.896 --> 00:07:41.566
It's very dark out by the back door.

00:07:41.649 --> 00:07:43.150
And it's not even locked.

00:07:43.693 --> 00:07:44.527
Will you be okay?

00:07:45.486 --> 00:07:47.863
The outdoor light is missing a bulb.

00:07:47.947 --> 00:07:49.448
You saw it?

00:07:49.949 --> 00:07:51.492
That's why I went out.

00:07:51.576 --> 00:07:53.327
My bike skidded in the rain

00:07:53.411 --> 00:07:57.164
on my way back from the hardware store,
shattering the bulb.

00:07:58.374 --> 00:08:00.251
You rode your bike in this weather?

00:08:01.252 --> 00:08:03.462
Yes. There's nowhere to park there.

00:08:07.967 --> 00:08:08.801
Ms. An!

00:08:30.865 --> 00:08:32.074
Ms. An!

00:08:40.583 --> 00:08:43.836
I'm sorry for the trouble,
especially in this rain.

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:46.922
If there's an emergency,
call us right away like you did today.

00:08:47.006 --> 00:08:48.341
Yes, I will.

00:08:48.424 --> 00:08:50.885
Take care of your injuries and rest up.
See you later.

00:08:50.968 --> 00:08:52.011
Okay, thanks. See you.

00:08:52.094 --> 00:08:53.804
-No need to see me out.
-Okay.

00:08:53.888 --> 00:08:54.722
Good.

00:09:05.483 --> 00:09:07.401
-You should go back inside.
-It's okay.

00:09:07.485 --> 00:09:09.862
You should get inside. It's slippery.

00:09:11.989 --> 00:09:14.408
-Seriously, go back inside.
-I'll just see you off.

00:09:14.492 --> 00:09:16.911
Okay, get inside. I'm off now.

00:09:18.746 --> 00:09:19.997
My God, this rain…

00:10:44.457 --> 00:10:47.585
HONGSEO UNIVERSITY

00:10:59.472 --> 00:11:00.681
OFFICE
PROF. JIN YOUNG-IN

00:11:04.351 --> 00:11:07.146
TO LAWYER JIN YOUNG-IN
PLEASE GIVE THIS TO MO EUN

00:11:27.833 --> 00:11:32.546
KIM MUN-JUN

00:11:36.884 --> 00:11:38.803
This is mail for you.

00:11:38.886 --> 00:11:42.556
The seal is dated yesterday.
I brought it over as soon as I got it.

00:12:32.106 --> 00:12:33.816
May I ask what the photo is of?

00:12:35.401 --> 00:12:36.235
Ms. Mo.

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:39.655
If I'm allowed to take a look…

00:12:40.364 --> 00:12:41.198
Ms. Mo!

00:12:48.539 --> 00:12:50.499
Inmate 407, what are you doing?

00:12:52.585 --> 00:12:53.502
Spit it out.

00:12:55.421 --> 00:12:56.380
What was it?

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.383
What the hell was it?

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:10.352
The visitation is over.

00:13:23.532 --> 00:13:25.492
Why is it so hard to get ahold of you?

00:13:25.576 --> 00:13:27.953
Sop wants to eat with her mom.

00:13:28.454 --> 00:13:31.332
I'm making jjajangbap, so hurry on over.

00:13:33.584 --> 00:13:36.253
Although COVID-19 has been
somewhat contained,

00:13:36.337 --> 00:13:39.214
hospitals remain crowded with patients.

00:13:39.715 --> 00:13:41.175
With temperatures dropping,

00:13:41.258 --> 00:13:45.262
respiratory illnesses like the flu
and the cold have been on the rise,

00:13:45.346 --> 00:13:48.182
prompting medical centers
to tighten their preventive measures.

00:13:48.682 --> 00:13:50.100
The indoor mask rule is still…

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:09.411
Please don't kill me…

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:12.748
Die.

00:14:14.625 --> 00:14:16.794
You must die for us to live.

00:14:43.237 --> 00:14:44.279
Ow, that's hot!

00:14:44.363 --> 00:14:46.031
All right, come on.

00:14:47.992 --> 00:14:49.493
Pass it along like this.

00:14:49.576 --> 00:14:51.370
It looks fantastic!

00:14:52.746 --> 00:14:53.580
Clean it.

00:14:53.664 --> 00:14:56.250
Going down. Doors closing.

00:15:05.634 --> 00:15:06.719
Arms out.

00:15:10.931 --> 00:15:12.099
Arms down.

00:15:20.315 --> 00:15:22.860
Too bad it's already twelve o'clock

00:15:25.112 --> 00:15:26.989
What to do? It's already twelve o'clock

00:15:27.072 --> 00:15:28.615
Sounds like an initiation.

00:15:29.116 --> 00:15:31.827
-That's so cute!
-I don't want to let you go

00:15:33.579 --> 00:15:37.666
I want to whisper my love to you
In tune with the music

00:15:43.047 --> 00:15:45.299
This is the newbie taking Pudgy's place.

00:15:45.382 --> 00:15:48.552
Say hello.
She's the real boss around here.

00:15:50.637 --> 00:15:51.638
Hello.

00:15:52.514 --> 00:15:53.640
I'm Gu Hui-yeong.

00:15:54.141 --> 00:15:56.769
She was sent here because juvie was full.

00:15:56.852 --> 00:15:59.313
She's charged with running
an online gambling website.

00:15:59.396 --> 00:16:04.568
Man, this kid's already got
such exceptional skills.

00:16:04.651 --> 00:16:05.652
So jealous for real.

00:16:05.736 --> 00:16:06.779
Actually…

00:16:09.531 --> 00:16:11.450
Why did you stop? Keep going.

00:16:11.533 --> 00:16:12.951
-All right.
-Keep going.

00:16:13.452 --> 00:16:15.788
They can keep singing, can't they?

00:16:15.871 --> 00:16:16.955
It's not disruptive.

00:16:17.039 --> 00:16:18.290
-Okay, she's cool.
-One, two.

00:16:18.373 --> 00:16:19.625
Two, three.

00:16:19.708 --> 00:16:24.213
Too bad it's already twelve o'clock

00:16:24.296 --> 00:16:28.050
What to do? It's already twelve o'clock

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:32.012
I don't want to let you go

00:16:32.763 --> 00:16:37.267
I know, how you feel it

00:16:38.477 --> 00:16:44.525
I want to whisper my love to you
In tune with the music

00:16:44.608 --> 00:16:48.028
I know we're both feeling the same…

00:16:48.737 --> 00:16:49.738
She's good.

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:54.618
You're really

00:16:56.411 --> 00:16:57.412
dead.

00:16:58.413 --> 00:17:00.541
I know, right?
That gal really knocks you dead.

00:17:01.542 --> 00:17:03.585
For fuck's sake.

00:17:03.669 --> 00:17:07.548
The new girl's trying so hard.
Give her a little applause, will you?

00:17:07.631 --> 00:17:09.466
She's getting embarrassed!

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:10.551
I see.

00:17:14.429 --> 00:17:15.848
I don't like…

00:17:17.891 --> 00:17:19.017
kids her age.

00:17:20.227 --> 00:17:21.562
You don't?

00:17:21.645 --> 00:17:22.729
Fair enough.

00:17:22.813 --> 00:17:24.356
-Come here.
-Yes?

00:17:24.439 --> 00:17:25.941
Sit your ass down here.

00:17:26.024 --> 00:17:27.276
Fucking listen carefully.

00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:29.069
You tried, so here's some advice.

00:17:29.153 --> 00:17:29.987
-Okay?
-Okay.

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:33.365
From now on, stay right next to that lady.

00:17:33.866 --> 00:17:36.118
Then no bitch will lay a finger on you.
Got it?

00:17:36.201 --> 00:17:37.327
-Yes.
-Good. Get up.

00:17:38.245 --> 00:17:39.663
I said get up, you brat.

00:17:41.206 --> 00:17:42.040
Move it.

00:17:55.804 --> 00:17:57.890
I'M LEAVING
I WON'T RETURN IF YOU LOOK FOR ME

00:17:57.973 --> 00:18:00.684
Is there a reason
you don't think he ran away?

00:18:00.767 --> 00:18:01.852
Please come this way.

00:18:02.352 --> 00:18:04.354
This text isn't from my grandson.

00:18:05.397 --> 00:18:10.235
The tone, spelling,
and spacing aren't his style.

00:18:14.114 --> 00:18:16.366
What about his friends
from his old school?

00:18:16.867 --> 00:18:20.329
He could be with them.
Maybe they went far away for some air or--

00:18:20.412 --> 00:18:22.956
He's no longer
in touch with those friends.

00:18:25.042 --> 00:18:26.543
Then, by any chance,

00:18:27.419 --> 00:18:31.840
have you checked the house
Se-hun used to live in?

00:18:32.341 --> 00:18:34.760
His parents died there
with their bodies contorted.

00:18:35.677 --> 00:18:37.554
He was too scared to even go near it.

00:18:37.638 --> 00:18:39.389
No way would he be there.

00:18:42.184 --> 00:18:44.686
I don't think
Se-hun had any close friends.

00:18:45.604 --> 00:18:49.691
He had lunch by himself
and always slept through classes.

00:18:49.775 --> 00:18:52.653
And you always came
to pick him up after school.

00:18:54.071 --> 00:18:56.031
-I see. Thanks.
-No problem.

00:18:57.616 --> 00:18:59.618
He hardly ever showed up to class.

00:18:59.701 --> 00:19:01.495
He came a few times at first,

00:19:01.578 --> 00:19:03.664
but these days,
he just checks in and leaves.

00:19:03.747 --> 00:19:06.291
When the kids found out
that the Witch killed his parents,

00:19:06.375 --> 00:19:09.086
no one really talked to him anymore.

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:15.259
The last text message was sent

00:19:15.342 --> 00:19:18.720
from near a large supermarket
in Deogi-dong, Ilsanseo-gu, Goyang City.

00:19:18.804 --> 00:19:21.723
And his phone was turned off
in Gongdeok-dong, Mapo-gu, Seoul.

00:19:22.307 --> 00:19:24.142
It looks like he has left Ilsan.

00:19:24.643 --> 00:19:26.228
It seems like

00:19:26.311 --> 00:19:29.064
his grandfather had a tight leash on him.

00:19:29.147 --> 00:19:31.358
So based on circumstances alone,

00:19:31.441 --> 00:19:34.278
it appears to be a simple runaway, but…

00:19:34.778 --> 00:19:36.488
Look into Ko Se-hun's background.

00:19:36.571 --> 00:19:39.324
Who his friends are,
what he does when alone,

00:19:39.408 --> 00:19:42.202
whether he talks to anyone
through online chat,

00:19:42.286 --> 00:19:44.538
and what games he plays. Everything.

00:19:44.621 --> 00:19:46.873
So you also think he's gone missing.

00:19:47.416 --> 00:19:49.334
I'll look into it and get back to you.

00:19:50.085 --> 00:19:51.044
Okay.

00:20:00.971 --> 00:20:01.972
Can I

00:20:03.056 --> 00:20:04.099
sit here?

00:20:17.279 --> 00:20:19.156
I heard we've got a little brat now.

00:20:19.239 --> 00:20:20.115
Here you are.

00:20:20.198 --> 00:20:21.783
Hello, ma'am. I'm Gu Hui-yeong.

00:20:21.867 --> 00:20:23.368
-Shush.
-Forget the damn intro.

00:20:25.037 --> 00:20:28.832
You'll vanish without a trace
if you hang around that chick.

00:20:28.915 --> 00:20:29.916
I'm sorry?

00:20:30.792 --> 00:20:32.461
She'll eat you alive.

00:20:35.088 --> 00:20:36.923
You could go to sleep one night

00:20:37.424 --> 00:20:39.801
and never wake up again.

00:20:40.886 --> 00:20:41.845
Get it?

00:20:42.471 --> 00:20:43.305
Yes.

00:20:43.805 --> 00:20:44.806
Let's go.

00:20:47.017 --> 00:20:48.727
Come on, you little brat.

00:20:50.604 --> 00:20:52.939
That doesn't sound so bad.

00:21:13.377 --> 00:21:15.879
Excuse me, would I be able to meet
with Officer Bae Sun-deok?

00:21:16.463 --> 00:21:18.632
One moment, please. Oh, ma'am.

00:21:18.715 --> 00:21:19.633
This is…

00:21:22.052 --> 00:21:23.261
Hello.

00:21:23.345 --> 00:21:24.221
Hello.

00:21:30.477 --> 00:21:32.020
How's An Yun-su doing these days?

00:21:32.104 --> 00:21:33.063
Sorry?

00:21:34.523 --> 00:21:36.566
You can just share what you can.

00:21:37.192 --> 00:21:39.277
Are her sessions going well?

00:21:40.529 --> 00:21:41.446
Well,

00:21:42.781 --> 00:21:45.575
she was silent
throughout the entire session.

00:21:45.659 --> 00:21:48.662
But that kind of attitude
won't do her any favors.

00:21:49.162 --> 00:21:50.163
Yes, I told her.

00:21:50.247 --> 00:21:53.375
I asked if she was okay for it
to be reported to the court as it was.

00:21:53.875 --> 00:21:55.168
She said yes.

00:21:57.170 --> 00:21:58.004
She

00:21:58.755 --> 00:22:00.799
seemed a little anxious.

00:22:01.299 --> 00:22:04.261
Here in my office and even in her home.

00:22:04.344 --> 00:22:06.012
She's like that whenever I see her.

00:22:11.768 --> 00:22:15.188
Could you possibly tell me
where she's been over the past three days?

00:22:22.237 --> 00:22:23.238
I see.

00:22:23.738 --> 00:22:26.867
I can tell you what I personally think,

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:29.828
but I can't share her records
without following procedure.

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:32.164
You know that, sir.

00:22:34.332 --> 00:22:35.250
I sure do.

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:39.171
I also know
that procedure never gets done in time.

00:22:43.008 --> 00:22:47.345
Is there some kind of problem
concerning An Yun-su?

00:22:49.264 --> 00:22:51.892
There was a problem
from the moment parole was granted.

00:22:53.268 --> 00:22:54.519
Right.

00:22:57.230 --> 00:23:02.152
GYEONGGI BUKBU PROBATION OFFICE

00:23:11.995 --> 00:23:14.289
Oh wow. Look at this.

00:23:15.624 --> 00:23:16.750
It's a girl though.

00:23:19.044 --> 00:23:20.462
Thanks anyway.

00:23:38.313 --> 00:23:41.525
ANKLE MONITOR MALFUNCTION REPORT RECEIVED

00:23:41.608 --> 00:23:44.819
There wasn't anything in particular
that could've been a problem.

00:23:47.322 --> 00:23:48.615
No, there wasn't.

00:24:52.929 --> 00:24:55.890
GRANDPA, I'M LEAVING

00:24:59.185 --> 00:25:01.438
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DRIVE ME
TO HAGWON ANYMORE

00:25:01.521 --> 00:25:03.231
I WON'T RETURN IF YOU LOOK FOR ME

00:26:39.327 --> 00:26:42.163
LOOKING FOR A MISSING TEENAGER!

00:26:54.008 --> 00:26:56.052
-Die.
-Please don't kill me.

00:26:58.638 --> 00:26:59.723
I'm sorry.

00:27:02.851 --> 00:27:08.440
Today, a teenager was reported missing
to Gyeonggi Bukbu Provincial Police.

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:12.777
The case was deemed too serious
to be considered a simple runaway,

00:27:12.861 --> 00:27:16.906
so the police have requested
that it be made public through the media.

00:27:17.407 --> 00:27:21.286
The missing teenager
has been identified as Ko Se-hun,

00:27:21.369 --> 00:27:22.704
the son of the dentist couple

00:27:22.787 --> 00:27:25.165
who were brutally murdered
four months ago.

00:27:25.665 --> 00:27:30.128
Given the gravity of the case, the police
have launched an immediate investigation

00:27:30.211 --> 00:27:33.298
and are currently reviewing
the CCTV footage

00:27:33.381 --> 00:27:35.925
of where Ko was last seen.

00:27:36.634 --> 00:27:38.470
This is a recording of Ko Se-hun

00:27:38.553 --> 00:27:41.556
in a hagwon district
at 5:00 p.m. last Friday.

00:27:41.639 --> 00:27:43.725
He hasn't been seen

00:27:43.808 --> 00:27:47.437
since he suddenly left
in the middle of a class.

00:27:47.937 --> 00:27:49.731
His grandfather, who filed the report,

00:27:49.814 --> 00:27:52.484
claimed that the text message
Ko sent was out of character.

00:27:52.984 --> 00:27:54.694
Unlike his usual calm and clear tone,

00:27:54.778 --> 00:27:57.614
the message was inconsistent and rushed.

00:27:57.697 --> 00:28:00.658
His grandfather knew
it was more than a simple disappearance

00:28:00.742 --> 00:28:02.994
and immediately reported it to the police.

00:28:03.536 --> 00:28:05.038
Fucking bastard.

00:28:06.039 --> 00:28:07.832
I hope you drop dead somewhere.

00:28:14.464 --> 00:28:15.715
One, two…

00:28:18.426 --> 00:28:19.469
Is it three?

00:28:19.552 --> 00:28:20.720
No.

00:28:59.843 --> 00:29:02.637
MISSING TEENAGER CASE

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:14.232
MURDERED PARENTS, NOW MISSING SON?
HEATED DEBATE OVER KO'S DISAPPEARANCE

00:29:29.455 --> 00:29:31.708
Inmate 407, come get your meds.

00:29:52.729 --> 00:29:53.563
Confirmed.

00:29:55.565 --> 00:29:56.733
Did you see the news?

00:30:01.988 --> 00:30:03.364
Their kid has gone missing.

00:30:07.285 --> 00:30:09.454
Do you seriously not feel anything?

00:30:11.581 --> 00:30:13.583
What am I supposed to feel?

00:30:17.003 --> 00:30:18.504
I did think this though.

00:30:20.381 --> 00:30:21.925
"Maybe that kid

00:30:22.508 --> 00:30:24.761
will be with his parents now."

00:30:59.921 --> 00:31:04.008
If you eat ramyeon now, the damn smell
will reach the warden's office.

00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:42.255
You know,

00:31:43.589 --> 00:31:45.967
I actually knew the people you killed.

00:31:56.394 --> 00:31:57.437
You see,

00:31:59.188 --> 00:32:01.899
I believe what they got
was divine punishment.

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:07.196
Who…

00:32:10.992 --> 00:32:12.994
who are you?

00:32:35.558 --> 00:32:37.477
KANG SO-MANG

00:32:54.535 --> 00:32:55.661
Hey.

00:32:56.871 --> 00:32:57.705
Will you

00:32:58.498 --> 00:33:02.085
do what I asked now?

00:33:03.711 --> 00:33:05.755
How do you want to die?

00:33:11.886 --> 00:33:14.222
Oh my God. Seriously!

00:33:37.495 --> 00:33:38.955
26 KM TO MYANMAR-THAILAND BORDER

00:33:47.171 --> 00:33:50.049
I'm sorry, So-mang.

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:53.678
I'm sorry, So-mang.

00:34:06.941 --> 00:34:09.402
A fire broke out in a dilapidated building

00:34:09.485 --> 00:34:11.821
with flammable materials inside,

00:34:11.904 --> 00:34:14.824
causing the fire to spread quickly.

00:34:15.324 --> 00:34:18.411
Fire officials are conducting
safety inspections,

00:34:18.494 --> 00:34:20.788
checking for any further damage.

00:34:21.330 --> 00:34:23.916
Up next, around 6:00 p.m. yesterday,

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.088
the police were dispatched
to an apartment in Bupyeong-gu, Incheon,

00:34:29.172 --> 00:34:31.799
after a dispute broke out
over noise between floors.

00:34:31.883 --> 00:34:34.802
"A" complained that the ongoing noise

00:34:34.886 --> 00:34:37.430
from the upstairs unit was unbearable.

00:34:37.513 --> 00:34:40.224
This sparked an argument
with "B" from upstairs,

00:34:40.308 --> 00:34:42.226
which escalated
into a physical altercation.

00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:44.228
BREAKING NEWS:
ILSAN DENTIST COUPLE MURDER SUSPECT

00:34:44.312 --> 00:34:45.646
HOSPITALIZED AFTER SUICIDE ATTEMPT

00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:47.899
The police resolved the situation
without any casualties,

00:34:47.982 --> 00:34:51.235
but other apartment residents
faced severe inconvenience.

00:34:51.319 --> 00:34:53.946
Once you kill that kid, come see me.

00:34:56.324 --> 00:34:58.576
And tell me how he died

00:35:00.161 --> 00:35:02.288
and what he was like

00:35:03.915 --> 00:35:05.541
in his final moments.

00:35:07.627 --> 00:35:09.754
Don't leave out a single detail.

00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:12.048
That will be

00:35:13.925 --> 00:35:16.093
the end of our deal.

00:35:37.907 --> 00:35:39.617
You must've had a hard time.

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:41.494
You look worn-out.

00:35:42.745 --> 00:35:44.372
I didn't think you'd come yourself.

00:35:44.455 --> 00:35:45.623
We should close our deal.

00:35:51.837 --> 00:35:52.838
Tell me

00:35:54.423 --> 00:35:56.634
how he died

00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:59.512
and how he looked when he did.

00:36:00.012 --> 00:36:02.098
Tell me from the beginning in detail.

00:36:08.229 --> 00:36:09.981
He was playing a video game on the couch.

00:36:11.941 --> 00:36:15.861
He was so engrossed
he didn't notice me coming up behind him.

00:36:17.738 --> 00:36:20.700
I shocked him with a stun gun,
and he fell, flailing on the floor.

00:36:26.831 --> 00:36:29.417
I strangled him with all my strength,
using both hands,

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:30.668
and told him to die.

00:36:33.713 --> 00:36:34.672
Please don't kill me.

00:36:34.755 --> 00:36:35.923
He begged for his life.

00:36:37.758 --> 00:36:40.011
He begged in tears, saying he was sorry.

00:36:43.681 --> 00:36:46.017
I felt his life draining out of his body.

00:36:50.563 --> 00:36:51.856
His limbs went limp,

00:36:52.815 --> 00:36:54.608
and his eyes rolled back.

00:36:56.986 --> 00:36:58.821
That's when I stabbed him in the neck.

00:37:00.072 --> 00:37:01.699
Consider this divine punishment.

00:37:13.002 --> 00:37:15.713
Did you look him in the face
when you stabbed him?

00:37:17.590 --> 00:37:18.424
Yeah.

00:37:33.189 --> 00:37:34.899
You didn't kill him, did you?

00:37:36.567 --> 00:37:37.401
You

00:37:37.902 --> 00:37:39.403
didn't

00:37:40.821 --> 00:37:42.281
kill him.

00:37:43.282 --> 00:37:44.658
What? I killed him.

00:37:49.705 --> 00:37:50.915
I killed him.

00:37:56.087 --> 00:37:57.797
I killed him with my own hands.

00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:59.757
Why won't you believe me?

00:39:11.704 --> 00:39:13.622
There's someone trying to kill you.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.544
I'm sure you know what you did

00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:20.004
to that person.

00:39:24.884 --> 00:39:26.760
She will never stop.

00:39:30.639 --> 00:39:32.766
If I don't kill you, someone else will.

00:39:32.850 --> 00:39:35.352
If that person fails,
she'll send another person

00:39:35.853 --> 00:39:37.730
until you're killed.

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:40.524
Do you understand?

00:39:44.069 --> 00:39:46.030
If you want to live, do as I say.

00:40:03.047 --> 00:40:05.341
No one can know you're alive.

00:40:06.008 --> 00:40:07.092
Not your grandfather.

00:40:07.593 --> 00:40:08.511
Not your friends.

00:40:10.054 --> 00:40:12.181
You cannot be seen alive by anyone.

00:40:18.103 --> 00:40:20.064
Grandpa doesn't know that I come here.

00:40:20.564 --> 00:40:22.691
He thinks I'm scared of this place.

00:40:23.651 --> 00:40:26.904
I'll stay in the basement.
You can lock the door from the outside.

00:40:35.037 --> 00:40:36.413
It's just one week.

00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:38.707
One week.

00:40:40.709 --> 00:40:42.044
Stay hidden like you're dead.

00:40:42.545 --> 00:40:43.921
Just until I come back.

00:40:52.429 --> 00:40:54.932
I'll put everything back
to the way it was.

00:41:05.276 --> 00:41:06.652
That's enough.

00:41:10.906 --> 00:41:13.409
Our deal's off now.

00:41:19.415 --> 00:41:22.209
You're right.
It's not him I should kill. It's you.

00:41:23.669 --> 00:41:25.504
Do you think you can kill me

00:41:26.213 --> 00:41:27.590
when you couldn't kill him?

00:41:30.342 --> 00:41:33.679
Do you even know
how to kill someone with that?

00:41:38.267 --> 00:41:41.562
You have to fill the syringe with air
and stick it into the heart.

00:41:41.645 --> 00:41:44.064
Then inject the air.

00:41:44.565 --> 00:41:47.443
The air will block the blood vessels

00:41:48.235 --> 00:41:49.486
and kill me.

00:41:52.364 --> 00:41:53.282
Go on.

00:42:03.959 --> 00:42:05.461
I couldn't kill him.

00:42:07.963 --> 00:42:10.215
Even if he deserves to die, how could I…

00:42:10.299 --> 00:42:14.219
how could I possibly do that?
How can one person kill another?

00:42:18.474 --> 00:42:21.185
If they deserve to die, they should.

00:42:22.102 --> 00:42:23.103
He should.

00:42:24.146 --> 00:42:24.980
So should I.

00:42:27.358 --> 00:42:29.652
I'll expose his crime to the world.

00:42:29.735 --> 00:42:31.153
I'll make him pay for it.

00:42:31.654 --> 00:42:33.739
I'll make him suffer
for the rest of his life.

00:42:34.531 --> 00:42:35.741
So please.

00:42:36.325 --> 00:42:37.326
Plea…

00:42:43.874 --> 00:42:45.459
Give me another chance.

00:42:45.542 --> 00:42:46.752
Just one more.

00:42:48.337 --> 00:42:49.463
That kid…

00:42:53.092 --> 00:42:54.134
is dead.

00:49:24.691 --> 00:49:29.696
