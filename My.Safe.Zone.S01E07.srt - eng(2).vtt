00:00:59.705 --> 00:01:02.545
I don't think she'll ever forgive me.

00:01:03.985 --> 00:01:06.025
You should at least let her talk.

00:01:06.105 --> 00:01:09.505
Listen first, then decide.

00:01:09.585 --> 00:01:11.665
Maybe just call her and get it over with.

00:01:11.745 --> 00:01:14.025
-Not jealous?
-Not jealous,

00:01:14.705 --> 00:01:16.185
because you're mine.

00:01:17.145 --> 00:01:17.985
Lin.

00:01:19.905 --> 00:01:23.465
I'll do anything,
just give us another chance.

00:01:25.465 --> 00:01:27.305
I still love you, darling.

00:01:35.625 --> 00:01:37.425
I'm almost done.

00:01:39.185 --> 00:01:42.425
That was fast. Did you even try?

00:01:44.425 --> 00:01:47.625
Of course I did. You have to use it too.

00:01:49.985 --> 00:01:51.105
I will.

00:02:01.105 --> 00:02:02.225
Done.

00:02:02.945 --> 00:02:04.545
Now let me see yours.

00:02:05.345 --> 00:02:06.265
Wait.

00:02:07.185 --> 00:02:08.705
Wait till I'm finished.

00:02:08.785 --> 00:02:10.425
Will that day ever come?

00:02:19.705 --> 00:02:21.065
Done.

00:02:28.345 --> 00:02:29.545
Thanks.

00:02:32.505 --> 00:02:34.145
Where's mine?

00:02:35.745 --> 00:02:37.105
I'm not giving it to you anymore.

00:02:37.665 --> 00:02:40.545
-Why?
-Yours is cuter.

00:02:40.625 --> 00:02:43.345
See? You finished early

00:02:44.065 --> 00:02:45.505
because you didn't take it seriously.

00:02:50.065 --> 00:02:52.105
-Let me see.
-No!

00:03:03.785 --> 00:03:05.025
Fine, I don't want it then.

00:03:07.185 --> 00:03:08.825
Don't be mad.

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:21.065
I knew you'd laugh.

00:03:23.945 --> 00:03:25.265
It's cute.

00:03:27.145 --> 00:03:30.905
Thanks. Let's use them.

00:03:40.585 --> 00:03:42.905
TOKEN OF LOVE

00:03:42.985 --> 00:03:47.025
RING OF LOVE

00:03:47.665 --> 00:03:48.905
Why are they talking for so long?

00:03:53.185 --> 00:03:56.025
I should've just said I was jealous,

00:03:56.105 --> 00:03:58.545
super jealous,
then it would've ended faster.

00:04:07.065 --> 00:04:08.945
-What did she say?
-Get home safe.

00:04:33.025 --> 00:04:33.945
Hello.

00:04:35.465 --> 00:04:37.145
Do you know Lin?

00:04:42.665 --> 00:04:45.505
-What did she say?
-She apologized.

00:04:45.585 --> 00:04:46.665
That's it?

00:04:47.745 --> 00:04:49.585
And asked to get back together.

00:04:51.185 --> 00:04:52.945
I almost fell for it.

00:04:53.865 --> 00:04:56.425
-Fell for what?
-Thinking she was a good person.

00:04:59.185 --> 00:05:01.145
So what did you say?

00:05:03.305 --> 00:05:06.425
I said I forgive her,

00:05:06.505 --> 00:05:08.065
but I can't be more than friends,

00:05:10.585 --> 00:05:13.185
because you're my only girlfriend.

00:05:17.585 --> 00:05:18.785
You're crazy.

00:05:24.465 --> 00:05:26.345
It's good.

00:05:26.425 --> 00:05:29.065
Lin's grown up.
She can take care of you now.

00:05:29.145 --> 00:05:30.865
She won't make bad decisions.

00:05:32.825 --> 00:05:36.785
Yeah, I know I'm lucky to have her.

00:05:36.865 --> 00:05:38.425
Of course.

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:40.865
You're more than lucky,
like winning the lottery.

00:05:41.825 --> 00:05:43.705
Lin's strong like you,

00:05:43.785 --> 00:05:45.945
but smarter, braver,

00:05:46.025 --> 00:05:49.345
and a natural leader.

00:05:50.665 --> 00:05:52.705
She's the head of the household.

00:05:55.305 --> 00:05:58.425
Thank you so much. Without you,

00:05:58.505 --> 00:06:01.465
Lin might not have grown up so happy.

00:06:04.665 --> 00:06:08.545
You've done a wonderful job as a mother.

00:06:10.785 --> 00:06:14.385
She turned out kind and independent.

00:06:15.185 --> 00:06:17.225
Isn't that what we all want?

00:06:22.065 --> 00:06:24.185
Be kind to yourself, Aom.

00:07:25.785 --> 00:07:27.705
-Lin, dear?
-Yes?

00:07:29.545 --> 00:07:30.825
What did Kate say?

00:07:35.185 --> 00:07:36.865
She apologized.

00:07:38.745 --> 00:07:41.305
And did you forgive her?

00:07:44.505 --> 00:07:46.185
I can forgive you.

00:07:49.385 --> 00:07:51.905
But I can't be with you again.

00:07:58.105 --> 00:08:00.265
It's always just been the two of us.

00:08:01.065 --> 00:08:03.345
I don't want to fight with you
over someone else.

00:08:06.025 --> 00:08:08.385
I want to make you proud.

00:08:08.945 --> 00:08:10.545
I want you to be happy.

00:08:14.465 --> 00:08:17.385
If I ever said anything that hurt you,

00:08:18.945 --> 00:08:20.345
I'm sorry.

00:08:20.425 --> 00:08:22.905
I should be the one saying sorry

00:08:22.985 --> 00:08:26.865
for making you feel like I cared more
about something else than your happiness.

00:08:28.265 --> 00:08:29.545
I'd forgotten

00:08:29.625 --> 00:08:32.825
how betrayal feels.

00:08:34.945 --> 00:08:36.904
I'm not mad at you.

00:08:41.105 --> 00:08:42.784
I know what hardship is.

00:08:42.865 --> 00:08:44.425
I've lived through it.

00:08:44.505 --> 00:08:47.345
That's why I don't want you
to struggle like I did.

00:08:49.425 --> 00:08:50.905
I know, Mom.

00:08:51.585 --> 00:08:54.265
I used to wait up for you every night.

00:08:57.945 --> 00:09:00.425
I knew how hard you worked.

00:09:02.225 --> 00:09:03.785
Don't worry.

00:09:04.625 --> 00:09:06.865
I'll choose what's best for myself.

00:09:07.985 --> 00:09:09.745
I won't make you sad.

00:09:11.985 --> 00:09:13.305
I love you, Mom.

00:09:16.065 --> 00:09:18.905
I love you more than anything, Lin.

00:09:30.905 --> 00:09:32.865
Aunt Tukta told me about Pie.

00:09:33.425 --> 00:09:35.145
I think you two should leave town for now.

00:09:36.265 --> 00:09:37.705
Take a vacation.

00:09:38.985 --> 00:09:40.625
We don't know if Pie will stop.

00:09:41.385 --> 00:09:44.105
It's not safe here. Go stay at the resort.

00:09:44.185 --> 00:09:46.545
-What about the restaurant?
-I'll take care of it.

00:09:47.465 --> 00:09:49.745
You can't even cook. What would you do?

00:09:49.825 --> 00:09:51.625
Pete and Bam can handle it.

00:09:52.985 --> 00:09:55.985
Just don't change the menu next month.
Keep it as it is for now.

00:10:08.185 --> 00:10:09.145
Come on,

00:10:10.025 --> 00:10:11.385
think of it as a break.

00:10:11.465 --> 00:10:13.065
Just take yourself to the resort.

00:10:30.985 --> 00:10:33.025
Tim knows you don't feel anything for him.

00:10:33.105 --> 00:10:34.985
Then why is he still so nice to you?

00:10:35.065 --> 00:10:37.185
That's just how he is.

00:10:40.105 --> 00:10:41.745
And him being that nice…

00:10:44.425 --> 00:10:46.025
doesn't it make you feel anything?

00:10:46.825 --> 00:10:48.065
No.

00:10:53.945 --> 00:10:55.265
What about this kind of hug?

00:10:55.945 --> 00:10:58.185
-Do you feel anything?
-I do.

00:11:00.105 --> 00:11:01.345
A lot.

00:11:28.385 --> 00:11:30.225
‎I'm yours now.

00:11:31.705 --> 00:11:33.145
You're mine only.

00:12:12.345 --> 00:12:13.945
If I'm not partners with Pie anymore,

00:12:14.025 --> 00:12:16.585
how do I stop people
from finding out I got fired?

00:12:19.105 --> 00:12:22.665
I don't want people to think
I was incompetent and got fired.

00:12:22.745 --> 00:12:24.385
If they do,

00:12:24.465 --> 00:12:26.705
I might never get another good job.

00:12:27.345 --> 00:12:28.945
Your mom already understands.

00:12:29.785 --> 00:12:32.625
You don't need an excuse
to come back here.

00:12:33.665 --> 00:12:35.585
Let people talk.

00:12:43.345 --> 00:12:45.265
The world isn't just social media.

00:12:47.225 --> 00:12:50.825
Happiness doesn't come
from chasing success, Lin.

00:12:55.225 --> 00:12:57.065
But how can I be happy

00:12:57.945 --> 00:12:59.825
when my life feels like a failure?

00:13:00.665 --> 00:13:02.105
Who said you're a failure?

00:13:02.185 --> 00:13:04.905
You love photography, don't you?

00:13:05.985 --> 00:13:07.665
You can still take pictures.

00:13:10.625 --> 00:13:13.065
No one can stop you from being happy.

00:13:18.865 --> 00:13:20.225
Take one of me.

00:13:23.145 --> 00:13:24.185
Sure.

00:14:01.665 --> 00:14:03.385
They're so in love.

00:14:04.665 --> 00:14:05.665
See?

00:14:11.025 --> 00:14:11.865
I see.

00:14:12.865 --> 00:14:14.025
I've seen it for a long time.

00:14:20.945 --> 00:14:22.505
I've loved Jane

00:14:23.945 --> 00:14:25.225
and waited for her for years.

00:14:28.465 --> 00:14:29.865
But she never saw me.

00:14:33.225 --> 00:14:35.185
Until Lin came back,

00:14:36.865 --> 00:14:38.025
then I understood why.

00:14:42.145 --> 00:14:43.865
Then why keep trying?

00:14:52.745 --> 00:14:53.865
I don't want to regret…

00:14:57.225 --> 00:14:59.025
not doing everything I could.

00:15:22.545 --> 00:15:24.425
I thought
we were having dinner at the resort.

00:15:25.385 --> 00:15:27.825
We are, right here at the resort.

00:15:29.705 --> 00:15:31.745
I picked an outfit for you.

00:15:38.145 --> 00:15:39.265
Do you want to change now?

00:15:40.385 --> 00:15:41.665
I'll help.

00:16:17.225 --> 00:16:18.745
Or should we not go at all?

00:16:40.745 --> 00:16:43.945
If you don't stop,
we really won't make it to dinner.

00:17:27.865 --> 00:17:29.425
Can we skip dinner then?

00:17:46.985 --> 00:17:48.465
No.

00:18:39.185 --> 00:18:42.505
Daisies symbolize childhood memories.

00:18:42.585 --> 00:18:45.225
They represent pure love,

00:18:45.305 --> 00:18:47.705
like the love you've always had for me.

00:18:59.985 --> 00:19:01.185
You know,

00:19:02.025 --> 00:19:04.025
every time I've been in love,

00:19:05.625 --> 00:19:07.265
deep down I was scared.

00:19:09.625 --> 00:19:12.145
Scared it would end badly again.

00:19:16.145 --> 00:19:17.225
But this time,

00:19:22.025 --> 00:19:23.625
I'm not scared at all.

00:19:30.345 --> 00:19:31.385
Thank you, Jane,

00:19:33.865 --> 00:19:35.625
for always being by my side.

00:19:39.025 --> 00:19:41.385
And I'm sorry I realized it so late.

00:19:44.025 --> 00:19:46.785
I made you wait
for who knows how many years.

00:20:10.625 --> 00:20:12.185
Are you sure now, Lin?

00:20:18.745 --> 00:20:20.825
I've never been this sure.

00:20:23.745 --> 00:20:25.305
When I came back,

00:20:27.425 --> 00:20:30.145
I didn't even think I could love again.

00:20:33.545 --> 00:20:36.825
But somehow, my heart healed.

00:20:41.905 --> 00:20:43.025
All I know is that…

00:20:47.625 --> 00:20:49.865
you make me so happy.

00:20:53.865 --> 00:20:55.865
You made me realize

00:20:58.265 --> 00:21:00.225
love doesn't have to be scary.

00:21:06.545 --> 00:21:09.105
Jane, will you stay with me forever?

00:21:11.825 --> 00:21:12.865
Yes.

00:21:14.785 --> 00:21:17.505
Ask me a hundred times,
and the answer will never change.

00:21:41.185 --> 00:21:43.545
I've waited for this moment for years.

00:21:45.065 --> 00:21:48.105
Since we were kids,
I just wanted to see you smile.

00:21:49.065 --> 00:21:51.185
I was always happy
just to see you every day.

00:21:51.265 --> 00:21:53.625
Then one day, when you got a girlfriend,

00:21:55.345 --> 00:21:57.305
that's when I realized

00:21:58.585 --> 00:22:00.465
I was secretly in love with my friend,

00:22:04.145 --> 00:22:06.265
the kind of love
that no one else could replace.

00:22:10.585 --> 00:22:12.825
So let this daisy

00:22:14.025 --> 00:22:15.945
be the symbol of our love.

00:22:18.305 --> 00:22:20.505
Like when couples exchange rings,

00:22:21.585 --> 00:22:23.065
there has to be one each, right?

00:23:19.345 --> 00:23:22.705
Ugh, why are you calling?

00:23:24.985 --> 00:23:26.745
Go look by the river.

00:23:26.825 --> 00:23:29.425
They're so in love it's sickening.

00:23:30.065 --> 00:23:32.025
What do I have to do to compete with that?

00:23:32.745 --> 00:23:33.865
-Hey.
-Hey!

00:23:33.945 --> 00:23:34.905
Are you okay? You weren't answering.

00:23:35.465 --> 00:23:38.225
Hey.
There's no privacy at your resort at all?

00:23:39.385 --> 00:23:42.705
You think just because you own the place,
you can barge into anyone's room?

00:23:44.265 --> 00:23:46.905
I thought you'd offed yourself,
so I came in.

00:23:54.665 --> 00:23:55.785
You checked already?

00:23:59.585 --> 00:24:01.065
Great.

00:24:01.705 --> 00:24:05.145
Now you know what dying
while still breathing looks like.

00:24:14.105 --> 00:24:16.545
Is the resort going to keep
knocking on my door all day or what?

00:24:18.305 --> 00:24:19.345
Thank you.

00:24:20.425 --> 00:24:23.105
I ordered it for you, too.

00:24:36.425 --> 00:24:38.625
Being proposed to
is kind of nerve-wracking, right?

00:24:41.945 --> 00:24:43.345
Why are you smiling?

00:24:44.705 --> 00:24:46.345
It just feels good.

00:24:48.825 --> 00:24:50.905
Just turning and seeing you here

00:24:53.505 --> 00:24:54.905
makes me happy.

00:24:56.825 --> 00:24:58.545
I'll always be right here

00:24:59.465 --> 00:25:01.345
and be your happiness every day.

00:25:02.025 --> 00:25:05.505
No matter if it's the best day
or the worst,

00:25:06.145 --> 00:25:08.425
I'm not going anywhere.

00:25:14.385 --> 00:25:16.785
You should be with me, not Jane!

00:25:18.265 --> 00:25:19.185
Kate?

00:25:19.985 --> 00:25:21.105
Lin,

00:25:21.825 --> 00:25:23.665
I haven't canceled anything yet.

00:25:26.865 --> 00:25:28.865
I'm still waiting for you.

00:25:30.985 --> 00:25:35.385
I still have our wedding invitations,
the venue's still booked.

00:25:37.025 --> 00:25:38.865
I've just been waiting
for you to come back.

00:25:41.625 --> 00:25:45.025
Lin, I messed up.

00:25:45.105 --> 00:25:47.265
People make mistakes, right?

00:25:48.705 --> 00:25:51.385
You know I never screw up.

00:25:54.465 --> 00:25:56.345
I made a mistake, Lin.

00:25:57.345 --> 00:25:58.945
Please forgive me.

00:26:02.345 --> 00:26:05.025
I know now that you're the one

00:26:05.865 --> 00:26:07.625
who truly loved me.

00:26:15.665 --> 00:26:16.545
Lin.

00:26:18.505 --> 00:26:19.785
Kate!

00:26:23.345 --> 00:26:24.185
Kate!

00:26:25.105 --> 00:26:25.985
Kate.

00:26:28.745 --> 00:26:29.745
Kate.

00:26:33.145 --> 00:26:34.185
Get up.

00:27:02.185 --> 00:27:04.385
Kate.

00:27:05.585 --> 00:27:07.185
I'm sorry.

00:27:09.785 --> 00:27:10.625
Let's go.

00:27:54.345 --> 00:27:55.705
Drink lots of water.

00:27:56.945 --> 00:27:58.865
You know you get drunk easily.
Why drink so much?

00:28:11.665 --> 00:28:13.465
So I don't have to feel…

00:28:14.745 --> 00:28:16.225
that you left me.

00:28:20.425 --> 00:28:21.505
Kate,

00:28:21.585 --> 00:28:23.505
do you even remember
what happened that day?

00:28:24.545 --> 00:28:26.665
Do you remember what you did?

00:28:26.745 --> 00:28:29.785
Now you think saying sorry is enough
to make things go back to how they were?

00:28:32.985 --> 00:28:35.105
I couldn't stay in New York.

00:28:35.185 --> 00:28:36.345
I couldn't stand seeing,

00:28:36.425 --> 00:28:39.225
staying, and breathing
in the same place that used to have you.

00:28:40.665 --> 00:28:42.785
Today you say you feel bad.

00:28:42.865 --> 00:28:45.705
Didn't I feel bad back then too?

00:29:07.785 --> 00:29:10.705
Enough. Stop doing this

00:29:13.105 --> 00:29:14.505
if you want to stay friends.

00:29:17.985 --> 00:29:18.945
Lin…

00:29:25.785 --> 00:29:30.425
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

00:29:35.145 --> 00:29:36.625
I'm sorry.

00:29:40.105 --> 00:29:41.265
I'm sorry.

00:29:51.145 --> 00:29:52.105
Jane.

00:29:54.505 --> 00:29:56.665
Why are you here?
What about the restaurant?

00:29:58.025 --> 00:30:00.105
I'll drive back to check on it tomorrow.

00:30:00.185 --> 00:30:01.665
So why did you come?

00:30:06.025 --> 00:30:07.585
My staff told me

00:30:08.385 --> 00:30:09.825
Kate checked in here.

00:30:12.265 --> 00:30:15.905
So I rushed over to see you.

00:30:19.265 --> 00:30:22.225
You're too late.
She's with Lin in the room.

00:30:28.145 --> 00:30:30.105
If they're together,

00:30:31.705 --> 00:30:32.825
then why are you out here?

00:30:46.625 --> 00:30:48.945
That means Kate still loves Lin,
doesn't she?

00:30:51.345 --> 00:30:53.025
She chased her all the way here.

00:30:55.945 --> 00:30:58.265
And Lin? What do you think Lin feels?

00:31:01.385 --> 00:31:03.145
She said she's moved on.

00:31:03.225 --> 00:31:04.585
And do you think she really has?

00:31:10.305 --> 00:31:11.465
Good question.

00:31:19.705 --> 00:31:21.105
Jane.

00:31:21.945 --> 00:31:24.065
Lin's here. I'll go.

00:31:24.625 --> 00:31:25.945
Thank you.

00:31:26.905 --> 00:31:28.305
If you need anything,

00:31:28.385 --> 00:31:29.425
call me.

00:31:30.745 --> 00:31:31.905
Tim.

00:31:37.385 --> 00:31:40.745
I'd like to book another room.
I'll handle the cost myself.

00:31:42.585 --> 00:31:43.505
Why?

00:31:44.345 --> 00:31:47.865
Kate's drunk.
I thought I'd give her the room.

00:31:47.945 --> 00:31:49.545
Jane and I will stay in another one.

00:31:49.625 --> 00:31:51.465
Got it. I'll take care of it.

00:32:09.745 --> 00:32:10.905
Finally, some rest.

00:32:58.705 --> 00:32:59.985
You're up?

00:33:01.465 --> 00:33:02.705
Why did you come back?

00:33:10.625 --> 00:33:13.225
So you were drunk on purpose last night?

00:33:16.625 --> 00:33:19.785
Lin is my girlfriend, not yours.

00:33:20.865 --> 00:33:23.345
So what? People can break up.

00:33:25.545 --> 00:33:27.065
Lin used to love me,

00:33:27.145 --> 00:33:29.345
so much we almost got married.

00:33:32.705 --> 00:33:34.065
The ring you're wearing,

00:33:34.145 --> 00:33:35.625
I have one too.

00:33:36.665 --> 00:33:38.945
How do you know
she loves you more than she loved me?

00:34:20.784 --> 00:34:21.865
Lin.

00:34:44.385 --> 00:34:46.145
You make me not want to get up.

00:34:53.304 --> 00:34:54.505
Do you love me?

00:34:57.185 --> 00:34:58.305
Of course.

00:34:59.665 --> 00:35:01.185
How much?

00:35:04.505 --> 00:35:05.585
So much.

00:35:10.705 --> 00:35:12.385
Between me and Kate,

00:35:13.225 --> 00:35:14.825
who do you love more?

00:35:26.825 --> 00:35:28.505
Obviously you.

00:35:43.465 --> 00:35:45.065
Breakfast must be here.

00:35:51.385 --> 00:35:53.385
I came to invite you to breakfast.

00:35:56.105 --> 00:35:57.665
I don't want to eat alone.

00:36:22.465 --> 00:36:23.425
Yes?

00:36:38.425 --> 00:36:39.545
Jane.

00:36:40.265 --> 00:36:41.385
Jane.

00:36:46.425 --> 00:36:47.745
Jane, where are you?

00:36:51.185 --> 00:36:52.625
What do you mean you already left?

00:37:02.705 --> 00:37:03.745
Jane,

00:37:04.305 --> 00:37:06.625
I thought you were staying longer.
Why are you back so soon?

00:37:06.705 --> 00:37:07.545
Hello, Auntie.

00:37:08.345 --> 00:37:09.185
Hello.

00:37:10.785 --> 00:37:13.505
-Here's Jane's bag.
-Just leave it there.

00:37:13.585 --> 00:37:16.225
Why did you come back with Jane?

00:37:17.425 --> 00:37:19.505
-Where's Lin?
-Lin's with Kate.

00:37:22.305 --> 00:37:24.905
The police wanted to talk to Jane
about the restaurant,

00:37:25.425 --> 00:37:26.745
so I brought her back first.

00:37:26.825 --> 00:37:29.345
Wait, the police want to talk to Jane?

00:37:30.625 --> 00:37:33.825
-How is she involved?
-The man who threw the rock

00:37:34.385 --> 00:37:35.665
claimed Jane hired him.

00:37:47.345 --> 00:37:49.585
-Are you okay?
-I didn't do anything.

00:37:50.585 --> 00:37:52.505
I'm giving a statement.
That should be enough.

00:37:53.105 --> 00:37:56.025
I know that.
I'm not worried about the case.

00:37:56.105 --> 00:37:59.505
I'm worried about you.

00:37:59.585 --> 00:38:01.745
Tim said Kate followed you to the resort.

00:38:05.625 --> 00:38:07.545
Maybe they missed each other.

00:38:07.625 --> 00:38:09.145
It's been a month.

00:38:10.785 --> 00:38:11.945
Jane.

00:38:17.145 --> 00:38:19.585
I know Lin loves me.

00:38:21.665 --> 00:38:23.665
But I can't help how I feel

00:38:23.745 --> 00:38:25.545
when I see Kate close to her.

00:38:32.545 --> 00:38:34.025
When Lin looks at Kate,

00:38:35.385 --> 00:38:37.465
it still seems like she cares.

00:38:38.345 --> 00:38:40.345
They've known each other for a long time.

00:38:40.865 --> 00:38:43.065
Long enough
that they were about to get married.

00:38:48.465 --> 00:38:50.745
If Kate hadn't slept with a man,

00:38:50.825 --> 00:38:53.025
they probably would've married soon.

00:39:03.225 --> 00:39:05.585
Aom, do you still want Kate
and Lin to be together?

00:39:12.505 --> 00:39:14.665
Right now, I'll just leave it to Lin.

00:39:15.265 --> 00:39:17.585
You're the one who told Kate
to go to the beach, didn't you?

00:39:19.705 --> 00:39:20.585
I didn't.

00:39:22.865 --> 00:39:24.745
What's wrong, Tuk?

00:39:26.025 --> 00:39:27.145
Our kids are in love.

00:39:34.065 --> 00:39:36.585
You and Jane are like family.

00:39:36.665 --> 00:39:39.665
If something happens,
can we still face each other?

00:39:39.745 --> 00:39:42.665
That's why we're talking now.

00:39:43.305 --> 00:39:46.545
We've been through so much together.
We're not going to fight.

00:39:47.905 --> 00:39:49.505
Maybe it's a good thing after all,

00:39:49.585 --> 00:39:51.465
that we're finally
becoming one real family.

00:39:53.065 --> 00:39:54.705
That's it.

00:39:54.785 --> 00:39:57.305
But for now, let's give them space
to talk things through first.

00:39:59.225 --> 00:40:00.745
Thank you for your cooperation.

00:40:00.825 --> 00:40:02.025
Thank you.

00:40:02.105 --> 00:40:03.745
-I'll take my leave then.
-Alright.

00:40:03.825 --> 00:40:05.025
Thank you.

00:40:09.865 --> 00:40:11.745
I think they'll be able to confirm

00:40:11.825 --> 00:40:14.145
you had no ties to the attacker.

00:40:14.905 --> 00:40:16.065
Threre's no financial link.

00:40:16.145 --> 00:40:18.985
That's why I'm confident
there won't be a problem.

00:40:19.705 --> 00:40:21.745
Then why do you still look so worried?

00:40:26.265 --> 00:40:27.345
It's nothing.

00:40:29.265 --> 00:40:32.065
Hey, we've known each other
a long time, Jane.

00:40:32.145 --> 00:40:34.385
I know you well enough.

00:40:36.785 --> 00:40:40.025
When something's bothering you,
do you think I can't see it?

00:40:49.145 --> 00:40:49.985
Jane,

00:40:51.865 --> 00:40:53.545
I'd be okay

00:40:53.625 --> 00:40:56.065
if you chose to be with her
and she makes you happier than I do.

00:40:58.065 --> 00:40:59.265
But if that's how it is,

00:41:00.585 --> 00:41:02.145
why don't you give me a chance instead?

00:41:08.985 --> 00:41:10.025
I really think

00:41:10.905 --> 00:41:12.785
I could take better care of you
than she can.

00:41:34.545 --> 00:41:35.545
Jane.

00:41:36.625 --> 00:41:38.705
-Did you just get back?
-Yes.

00:41:43.465 --> 00:41:45.305
You're upset about Kate, aren't you?

00:41:49.705 --> 00:41:51.185
Yes.

00:41:53.025 --> 00:41:54.785
Why did you come back early?

00:41:58.145 --> 00:41:59.345
The police called me in.

00:41:59.945 --> 00:42:01.265
What happened, Jane?

00:42:01.345 --> 00:42:03.705
The guy who threw the rock
told them I hired him.

00:42:04.785 --> 00:42:07.305
Did you tell the police it was Pie?

00:42:07.385 --> 00:42:09.105
You know she was behind it.

00:42:09.185 --> 00:42:12.505
I did. And I think they believe me now.

00:42:21.585 --> 00:42:23.025
Why didn't you ask me
to come back with you?

00:42:23.105 --> 00:42:25.505
You were talking to Kate.
I didn't want to interrupt.

00:42:26.025 --> 00:42:28.465
Kate was drunk.

00:42:28.545 --> 00:42:30.465
Even if it'd been someone else,
I would've helped.

00:42:32.705 --> 00:42:33.625
I understand.

00:42:36.025 --> 00:42:37.265
No, you don't.

00:42:37.345 --> 00:42:40.865
If you really understood me,
you wouldn't have left like that.

00:42:41.425 --> 00:42:42.705
You're mad at me.

00:42:44.665 --> 00:42:46.625
Yes, I am.

00:42:46.705 --> 00:42:49.105
I'm mad that you cared so much
about Kate you forgot about me.

00:42:49.945 --> 00:42:52.865
I'm mad you went outside this morning
to talk to her alone.

00:42:53.825 --> 00:42:55.705
But I have the right to be mad, don't I?

00:42:57.985 --> 00:43:00.305
And don't I have the right to explain?

00:43:03.185 --> 00:43:04.425
We're over, Kate.

00:43:05.745 --> 00:43:09.505
I helped you because
I couldn't let someone drunk drown.

00:43:10.665 --> 00:43:13.585
But there won't be a wedding.
You have no place in my life anymore.

00:43:17.505 --> 00:43:19.305
You really can't forgive me, Lin?

00:43:21.145 --> 00:43:23.265
We can just postpone the wedding.

00:43:25.545 --> 00:43:28.865
Please don't leave me.
Please stay with me.

00:43:34.225 --> 00:43:37.225
I can only offer you friendship now,
because I don't love you anymore.

00:43:38.185 --> 00:43:39.785
But if you keep acting like this,

00:43:39.865 --> 00:43:41.545
we won't even be able to be friends.

00:43:42.705 --> 00:43:43.945
Lin.

00:43:44.625 --> 00:43:47.465
If you can't let go,
then let's stop seeing each other.

00:43:48.585 --> 00:43:50.185
It just makes things harder.

00:43:59.545 --> 00:44:01.305
I just wanted to make it clear to her,

00:44:02.025 --> 00:44:03.865
so she wouldn't do this again.

00:44:07.945 --> 00:44:09.545
So she'd know

00:44:10.825 --> 00:44:12.425
she can only ever be a friend.

00:44:15.865 --> 00:44:17.545
I told her already.

00:44:18.145 --> 00:44:19.985
Someone's already claimed me.

00:44:23.305 --> 00:44:25.305
I can't love anyone else now.

00:46:18.345 --> 00:46:19.905
I'm going to marry Lin.

00:46:19.985 --> 00:46:21.625
Your dream finally came true.

00:46:21.705 --> 00:46:23.465
But I still want to see Lin.

00:46:23.545 --> 00:46:25.945
If you know where she is,

00:46:27.425 --> 00:46:28.865
could you take me to her?

00:46:28.945 --> 00:46:30.585
There's something
I want to talk to you about.

00:46:32.305 --> 00:46:34.985
We're really going to be a family soon.

00:46:35.065 --> 00:46:36.265
Jane, what do you think--

00:46:39.025 --> 00:46:40.265
Jane!

00:47:15.145 --> 00:47:16.705
