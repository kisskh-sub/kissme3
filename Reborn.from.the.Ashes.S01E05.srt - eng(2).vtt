[Reborn from the Ashes]

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.440
[Episode 5]

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.670
I searched for this jade hairpin
for a long time.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.320
I thought Yi would surely like it.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.360
Where are you headed?

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.670
Father, the Governor
is hosting guests today.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.710
I should represent our family
to bring a gift.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.000
Back then, it was so hard
to find a woman

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.230
with pure Yang blood to treat you.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.840
Now, you lost your wife
for less than 100 days.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.710
And yet, you're planning to remarry.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.960
If you go to a crowded place,

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.840
people will surely talk
behind your back.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.360
You are not allowed
to go anywhere today.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.440
If this marriage weren't
to restrain the Su Family,

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.190
I would never allow you to do something
that tarnishes our family's honor.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:55.920
Jin,

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.150
you represent our family
to visit the Su Family.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.440
Yes, Father.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.760
Father, why must he go instead?

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.230
Why?

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.360
Because he is the heir apparent
of Prince Zhenbei's Mansion.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.740
Because he's not some heartless man

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:12.440
rushing to remarry

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.800
after his first wife's death.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.440
[Su Mansion]

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.080
[Su Feiyi's Birthday Banquet]

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.440
What now?

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.840
Perhaps I've been worn out
from managing the household these days.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.070
I feel I look quite haggard.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.110
She took advantage
and then played innocent,

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.840
deliberately showing off in front of me.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.840
Then you better take good care
of yourself.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.390
I'm entrusting you with the authority
to manage the household;

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.320
don't let my good intentions
go to waste.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.150
Madam, rest assured.

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.000
With me in charge now,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.880
there won't be the chaos we saw before.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.670
After all, the Su Family
is a prominent clan in Yunzhou City.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.600
Naturally, I wouldn't
use the pig-raising methods

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.730
you employed in the countryside
in your early years.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.000
How dare you!

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.230
What's wrong with raising pigs?

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.840
If you were sent to the countryside,

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.320
I'm afraid you wouldn't even be able
to keep pigs alive.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.760
Such a rough task as pig farming,

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.800
I would never stoop to it.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.630
You!

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.960
Greetings, Grandmother, Mother.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.150
Feiyi,

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.630
today is your birthday.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.000
No need for formalities.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.710
I heard you invited the crown prince
today.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.550
How does Grandmother know
I invited the crown prince?

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:36.590
No,

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.260
she absolutely cannot find out
I was rejected by the crown prince.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:40.920
Grandmother,

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.710
the crown prince had promised to come,

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.760
but he just sent a word

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.230
that urgent matters have come up,

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.550
and he cannot be freed from them.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.590
Looks like he won't make it today.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.360
No princess will come from our family,

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.630
and no smoke will rise
even from the grave.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.400
Why are you still standing there?

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.880
Hurry up and leave.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.670
Young Master Gong,
today is your cousin's birthday.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.400
So many ladies of noble families
have come.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.100
Have you found anyone
who caught your eye?

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.190
Lady,

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.110
may I ask your name?

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.710
This person is called Gong Shixian.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.670
He is Concubine Gong's only nephew.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.810
He's known for being ruthless
and shameless,

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.170
completely without conscience.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.320
He will try every means to get any woman

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.920
he sets his eyes on.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.880
Then,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.540
he spares no effort in tormenting her.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.760
Gong Shixian,

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.980
I'm just looking for a chance
to get revenge for Zhijin.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.070
Yet you came right to my door.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.030
What brings you here?

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.110
You're joking, Feiyi.

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.190
It's your birthday banquet.
I couldn't miss it.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.760
You look really tacky

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.230
in that bright red outfit.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.920
No wonder you come from the countryside.

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.440
For now,

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.510
you just can't keep up with our taste.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.110
So, according to you,

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.630
coming from the countryside

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.230
means lacking in taste.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.710
That's natural.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.480
Both vulgar and rustic.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.760
If that's how you see me,

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.670
I don't mind at all.

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:13.660
But,

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.550
you shouldn't speak like that
about your elders.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:16.230
I never said...

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.110
Grandmother,

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.280
she said that people
from the countryside like us

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.230
are both rustic and vulgar,

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.360
and that our taste is inferior

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.920
to that of these wealthy families.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.440
She said people from the countryside

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:28.840
are so crude and unbearable.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.710
Grandmother, I did not.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.320
You ungrateful wretch!

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:36.210
You old thing,

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.960
what right do you have
to hit my daughter?

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:38.940
Not only will I hit her,

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.190
but I will also hit you.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.800
You blind fool.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.920
Aunt.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:43.880
Grandmother.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.230
Stop fighting.

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.920
Grandmother.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.400
You old woman,

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.480
how dare you hit my aunt?

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.360
His Highness has arrived.

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.160
It seems Wanyan Qi

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.090
has finally become the crown prince
as he wished.

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.770
The crown prince
of Prince Zhenbei's Mansion

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:03.280
turns out to be him.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.550
This woman knows the crown prince.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.090
I absolutely can't let her
steal my spotlight in front of him.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.190
Qingran.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:14.630
We meet again.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.670
I don't understand what you mean.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.210
You did it on purpose.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.210
I don't understand what you're saying.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.990
Then I'll make you understand
what I mean.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.100
She's in the water.

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.960
Feiyi!

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.180
Quick, save her! Pull her up!

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.800
Feiyi!

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:39.840
Help her!

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:41.590
Hurry, hurry!

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:42.710
Come help us!

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.170
Right in front of all these people,

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.770
you dared to push Feiyi into the water.

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:47.320
If she hadn't provoked me,

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.000
why would I push her into it?

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:50.650
She only has herself to blame.

00:05:50.651 --> 00:05:56.045
(Watch on www.dramacool.club Support Admin)

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.480
I didn't expect the top courtesan
of the Begonia House

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.360
to be so vengeful.

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.110
I don't understand what you mean.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.440
Could it be that the day
at the Begonia House,

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.710
what I saw was really your ghost?

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:09.920
As a lady of the Su Family,
she actually went to a brothel.

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.010
An unmarried girl
actually did such a thing.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:13.430
It truly brings shame to her family.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.280
Exactly.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.880
I have been weak and sickly
since childhood,

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:18.880
so I was sent to the countryside
to recover.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.690
I recently returned to the mansion.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.030
If you don't believe me,

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:23.630
you can ask my sister.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.150
This concerns my reputation.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.150
If my name is ruined,
how can I ever marry?

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.630
You vile woman,

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:35.710
you're making me look bad.

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.260
And now you want me to cover for you.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.550
Your Highness,

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.320
my sister has been living
in the countryside these past years.

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:45.880
She only returned a few days ago.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.760
She has never been to the Begonia House.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.960
You must be mistaken.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.840
We are a scholarly family,

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:54.280
with strict family traditions.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.150
How could she have gone
to a place like Begonia House?

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.320
Please watch your words, Your Highness.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.150
Don't ruin the reputation
of the Su Family's daughter.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.550
Perhaps I was mistaken.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.510
How could Miss Su and the top courtesan
of the Begonia House be the same person?

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.330
Go back and change your clothes.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.150
I will take my leave now.

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:17.550
Wait.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.190
I think

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.920
you might have twisted your ankle.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.480
My foot's fine.

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:25.960
Let me escort you back.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.440
It does hurt a little.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.510
Your Highness.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:02.760
Qianyue.

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:05.150
The top courtesan of Begonia House.

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:06.590
Who?

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:09.800
How could you not know

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:11.880
who I'm talking about?

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:14.400
You said

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:15.630
I'm Miss Su.

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:17.560
I am an unmarried lady.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:18.920
How could I know

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:20.800
about the affairs of a top courtesan?

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.310
Smooth talker.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:24.920
I'm just speaking the truth.

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:36.960
Soon,

00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:38.960
I'll marry into your family,

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:40.960
becoming your brother's wife.

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.640
And yet, you and I remain
so ambiguous.

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:45.450
I'm afraid that is not appropriate.
