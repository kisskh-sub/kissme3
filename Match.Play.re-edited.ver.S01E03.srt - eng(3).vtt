00:00:19.458 --> 00:00:21.708
Are you crazy, coming here to work out?

00:00:21.833 --> 00:00:23.583
Beats sitting in a café.

00:00:23.708 --> 00:00:25.388
Besides, it's a good way to clear my head.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.292
How about a game?

00:00:28.417 --> 00:00:29.417
Ah.

00:00:29.542 --> 00:00:31.333
Is one-on-one a bit much for you?

00:00:33.625 --> 00:00:34.833
I'm not gonna go easy on you.

00:00:35.833 --> 00:00:37.458
When have I ever held back?

00:00:39.917 --> 00:00:41.208
My turn?

00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.542
You know, this is kind of surreal.

00:00:54.417 --> 00:00:55.750
What is?

00:00:56.458 --> 00:01:00.333
Hanging out with an actor like this...
I think it's a first for me.

00:01:01.292 --> 00:01:02.833
It's surreal.

00:01:06.875 --> 00:01:08.250
Like this?

00:01:09.542 --> 00:01:11.000
What's 'like this' supposed to mean?

00:01:18.542 --> 00:01:20.417
It's... just...

00:01:20.875 --> 00:01:23.458
Just working together,
shooting scenes, and all that.

00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:35.583
Mr. Moon Do-ha, you're someone
that's quite impossible to read.

00:01:38.375 --> 00:01:41.083
What are you talking
about? I'm an open book.

00:01:44.667 --> 00:01:46.625
Still, it feels good to move around.

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:53.000
We should do this again
sometime, when there's time.

00:01:54.208 --> 00:01:56.583
What, did you have fun playing against me?

00:01:56.708 --> 00:02:00.250
Yeah. Young-woo and Soo-hyun are too good.

00:02:00.375 --> 00:02:01.917
It takes the fun out of it.

00:02:03.292 --> 00:02:05.750
If I were actually trying,
you would've lost ages ago.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.833
Why do you keep saying
"you" "you" "you" (informal)?

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.250
You do know I'm older than you,
right?

00:02:12.375 --> 00:02:13.375
So what?

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.542
I have way more seniority in this industry.

00:02:16.625 --> 00:02:17.750
You debuted much later.

00:02:17.875 --> 00:02:19.917
I even looked up your filmography.

00:02:20.625 --> 00:02:22.458
What was the title again...

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.917
I can't remember.

00:02:27.042 --> 00:02:28.500
No idea.

00:02:32.417 --> 00:02:34.292
Shouldn't we get going?

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.375
Oh! Leaving already?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.458
What?

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.833
Nothing, I said let's go.

00:02:57.542 --> 00:02:58.417
What's with you?

00:02:58.542 --> 00:03:00.750
Are you waiting to hear from someone?

00:03:01.167 --> 00:03:02.417
How did you know?

00:03:03.042 --> 00:03:05.018
Isn't it that it's so obvious
just from seeing your face?

00:03:05.042 --> 00:03:06.042
Really?

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.542
Come on, who is it?

00:03:08.667 --> 00:03:10.083
It's no one.

00:03:25.208 --> 00:03:26.208
Bro.

00:03:26.292 --> 00:03:26.792
What?

00:03:26.917 --> 00:03:28.625
You got a girlfriend, don't you?

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.250
What?

00:03:30.375 --> 00:03:31.583
Am I wrong?

00:03:32.208 --> 00:03:33.000
What are you talking about?

00:03:33.125 --> 00:03:34.583
Why would you think that?

00:03:34.708 --> 00:03:37.750
Lately, you check your phone
the second we wrap.

00:03:37.875 --> 00:03:39.542
Spot on.

00:03:39.667 --> 00:03:41.208
What can I say?

00:03:41.333 --> 00:03:42.792
It's Moon Do-ha.

00:03:43.292 --> 00:03:44.500
What?

00:03:44.625 --> 00:03:46.750
Are you that close with Moon Do-ha?

00:03:47.333 --> 00:03:49.083
Close? Of course not.

00:03:50.375 --> 00:03:52.000
We're just talking about work.

00:03:52.125 --> 00:03:53.309
Do you really think Moon Do-ha and I...

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:54.768
are close enough to chat like that?

00:03:54.792 --> 00:03:56.167
So boring.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.625
Yes, Director.

00:03:59.875 --> 00:04:02.083
He seems to be in a good mood lately.

00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.208
Don't tell me he actually got a girlfriend.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.958
You're probably right that he
is in that kind of relationship...

00:04:09.917 --> 00:04:10.917
Huh?

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.333
Mr. Gu Jae-yeon.

00:04:13.458 --> 00:04:15.750
When do you sleep?

00:04:18.208 --> 00:04:19.833
Hello, Mr. Moon Do-ha.

00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.875
- Are you done?
- See? It's Moon Do-ha again.

00:04:23.375 --> 00:04:24.875
Huh?

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.750
Hold on a second.

00:04:25.875 --> 00:04:26.375
What is it?

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.042
Don't tell me he's...

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.670
pretending it's Moon Do-ha when
he's actually on the phone with a girl?

00:04:33.125 --> 00:04:36.000
Forget stunts. You
should be a screenwriter.

00:04:41.625 --> 00:04:43.375
- Mr. Gu Jae-yeon!
- You scared me.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.500
He's not here.

00:04:45.542 --> 00:04:47.167
What?

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.375
Do you know where Gu Jae-yeon went?

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.208
He's been swamped lately.

00:04:51.333 --> 00:04:54.167
Filming is about to wrap up,
so he must be incredibly busy.

00:04:54.417 --> 00:04:56.208
- One more time.
- Yes, sir.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:14.250
Hello?

00:05:14.333 --> 00:05:16.583
What took you so long to answer?

00:05:19.375 --> 00:05:21.250
You know it's late, right?

00:05:22.333 --> 00:05:23.042
Yeah.

00:05:23.167 --> 00:05:24.934
And you know we have
a shoot tomorrow, right?

00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.292
Of course, I do.

00:05:26.417 --> 00:05:27.897
You'll be there too, Mr. Gu Jae-yeon.

00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.917
My number one punching bag.

00:05:31.167 --> 00:05:33.208
Why aren't you sleeping?

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:35.083
I'd like to know that myself.

00:05:35.208 --> 00:05:37.333
Why I can't fall asleep.

00:05:37.458 --> 00:05:39.458
Don't you know some kind of trick?

00:05:39.583 --> 00:05:41.750
You know, a way to fall asleep.

00:05:42.292 --> 00:05:43.958
Well, there is one thing...

00:05:44.083 --> 00:05:45.083
What is it?

00:05:46.208 --> 00:05:47.309
If I tell you, will you do it?

00:05:47.333 --> 00:05:48.583
I have to at least try.

00:05:48.708 --> 00:05:50.375
The shoot is tomorrow.

00:05:51.292 --> 00:05:53.125
Then let's switch to a video call.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.125
I'll call you right back.

00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.583
Oh, there you are.

00:06:01.625 --> 00:06:03.167
Is it just me...

00:06:03.292 --> 00:06:05.500
or do you suddenly look more awake?

00:06:07.875 --> 00:06:10.208
Is it because I'm still young?

00:06:11.167 --> 00:06:12.708
Alright, let's begin.

00:06:12.833 --> 00:06:14.917
Is that your place, Mr. Gu Jae-yeon?

00:06:16.083 --> 00:06:17.083
Yeah.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.208
What are you doing?

00:06:20.333 --> 00:06:22.083
Giving myself a tour of your place?

00:06:22.208 --> 00:06:24.248
Is it your first time seeing
somebody else's house?

00:06:25.667 --> 00:06:28.125
Well, I mean...

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.250
It's like seeing a friend's place...

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.101
You were about to say
something weird, weren't you?

00:06:35.125 --> 00:06:37.292
You think I don't even have any friends?

00:06:38.375 --> 00:06:39.750
Do you?

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.458
Right. Not surprised at all.

00:06:45.583 --> 00:06:48.708
So... what's this
method for falling asleep?

00:06:49.375 --> 00:06:50.917
Let's begin.

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:52.809
Keep your hips up. Don't let them drop.

00:06:52.833 --> 00:06:53.833
Five...

00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:54.958
Four...

00:06:55.083 --> 00:06:55.958
Three...

00:06:56.083 --> 00:06:57.792
Two...

00:06:57.917 --> 00:06:59.000
One...

00:06:59.125 --> 00:07:00.292
Good work.

00:07:00.417 --> 00:07:01.500
Are you crazy?

00:07:01.625 --> 00:07:03.542
Rest for 40 seconds.

00:07:03.667 --> 00:07:05.292
If you just push yourself like this...

00:07:05.417 --> 00:07:07.625
Talking will only make you more tired.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:09.500
No, I'm the one who's crazy.

00:07:09.625 --> 00:07:10.917
It's me.

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:15.208
Mr. Moon Do-ha?

00:07:15.333 --> 00:07:16.833
Mr. Moon Do-ha?

00:07:21.708 --> 00:07:23.167
Sleep well.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.417
Is Do-ha awake?

00:07:37.542 --> 00:07:38.958
You're here?

00:07:41.625 --> 00:07:43.143
You look like you're in great condition.

00:07:43.167 --> 00:07:44.417
Yeah.

00:07:44.542 --> 00:07:46.309
It's probably because
I slept well last night.

00:07:46.333 --> 00:07:48.417
What did you do before bed?

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.292
Take it easy... release the tension.

00:08:02.167 --> 00:08:03.458
Bro.

00:08:04.583 --> 00:08:06.375
Bro, what's with the outfit?

00:08:07.583 --> 00:08:09.375
Did you go film a show or something?

00:08:10.458 --> 00:08:11.917
What's up with him...

00:08:12.833 --> 00:08:14.333
What show?

00:08:14.458 --> 00:08:16.458
I just went for an interview.
What's the big deal?

00:08:17.083 --> 00:08:19.542
Don't get all high and mighty on me now.

00:08:20.042 --> 00:08:22.500
You should know your place.

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:33.690
Didn't you say you had an interview?

00:08:34.167 --> 00:08:36.167
You're practically a celebrity now.

00:08:36.292 --> 00:08:37.833
Me?

00:08:41.208 --> 00:08:42.708
What did you talk about?

00:08:42.833 --> 00:08:44.750
You must have mentioned me, right?

00:08:45.708 --> 00:08:47.468
You mean the rumors
that we don't get along?

00:08:50.167 --> 00:08:53.292
I turned down all the questions
about you, Mr. Moon Do-ha.

00:08:54.875 --> 00:08:56.458
You turned them down?

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.375
Yes.

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.292
How well do I even know
you, Mr. Moon Do-ha?

00:09:00.417 --> 00:09:02.125
How could I just speak carelessly?

00:09:02.917 --> 00:09:04.875
No, I mean...

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.083
You're not wrong, but...

00:09:09.833 --> 00:09:10.833
Do-ha.

00:09:10.875 --> 00:09:12.750
Mr. Jae-yeon's interview is out.

00:09:12.875 --> 00:09:13.976
He probably mentioned you, right?

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.125
I haven't checked it yet. Take a look.

00:09:17.333 --> 00:09:19.375
There's probably nothing to see.

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:31.792
I heard that your interview is up now.

00:09:32.375 --> 00:09:33.500
You came out looking great.

00:09:33.625 --> 00:09:35.125
The response has been good, too.

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:37.542
Yeah, thanks.

00:09:39.333 --> 00:09:40.875
That's it?

00:09:51.333 --> 00:09:53.417
How can a person be this cold?

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.875
After everything we've
been through together?

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.917
You didn't even say a single word about me.

00:09:58.042 --> 00:09:59.559
The lunch boxes, the
behind-the-scenes stuff...

00:09:59.583 --> 00:10:02.542
There's so much you could've talked about
from the past few weeks alone.

00:10:03.083 --> 00:10:04.458
I was just...

00:10:04.583 --> 00:10:06.000
I get it.

00:10:06.125 --> 00:10:07.542
I get it, but...

00:10:07.667 --> 00:10:10.250
I was just trying to be careful.

00:10:10.375 --> 00:10:12.333
Careful about what?

00:10:17.375 --> 00:10:20.583
You're the least ambitious person
I've ever met.

00:10:20.708 --> 00:10:23.083
You have less money and
you're less famous than I am.

00:10:32.083 --> 00:10:33.125
"Gu Jae-yeon"

00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.667
What's this about "real-life friend?"

00:10:44.833 --> 00:10:46.292
What is this?

00:10:48.583 --> 00:10:49.917
Where are you right now?

00:10:50.042 --> 00:10:51.333
The office.

00:10:51.458 --> 00:10:52.667
What are you doing?

00:10:52.792 --> 00:10:53.917
Packing up.

00:10:54.042 --> 00:10:55.500
Who is this?

00:10:55.625 --> 00:10:56.625
Moon Do-ha.

00:10:56.667 --> 00:10:58.250
There's something I need to ask you.

00:10:58.375 --> 00:10:59.125
Can I come over right now?

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:00.125
Huh?

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:01.601
You have to go to the set anyway, right?

00:11:01.625 --> 00:11:03.125
I'll give you a ride.

00:11:03.292 --> 00:11:04.750
Although I appreciate the offer,

00:11:04.875 --> 00:11:06.917
but I'm planning on going with my team.

00:11:07.042 --> 00:11:08.833
Then I'll see you on set.

00:11:10.417 --> 00:11:12.226
Do-ha, didn't you say you
were going somewhere?

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:13.292
Where are you going?

00:11:13.417 --> 00:11:14.500
To get coffee.

00:11:14.625 --> 00:11:15.726
I thought you didn't drink coffee.

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:17.292
It's coffee, okay!

00:11:17.417 --> 00:11:18.417
What's with you?

00:11:20.708 --> 00:11:22.292
Dude, just go with Moon Do-ha.

00:11:22.417 --> 00:11:23.667
That's a celebrity van.

00:11:23.792 --> 00:11:25.250
I hear they're really comfortable.

00:11:25.375 --> 00:11:27.458
Hey! I have to look after my team.

00:11:27.583 --> 00:11:28.601
What do you mean go [with him]...

00:11:28.625 --> 00:11:31.083
Ugh, seriously, man. You're unbelievable.

00:11:31.208 --> 00:11:33.042
You're just incredible, aren't you?

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:39.042
Oh, you're here?

00:11:39.167 --> 00:11:41.208
Yes, I'm here.

00:11:41.333 --> 00:11:42.917
I'm here.

00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.250
Did something happen?

00:11:46.708 --> 00:11:47.917
No.

00:12:03.042 --> 00:12:04.417
Mr. Moon Do-ha.

00:12:04.542 --> 00:12:05.768
I need to talk to you about something.

00:12:05.792 --> 00:12:06.917
The AD?

00:12:07.042 --> 00:12:08.583
What's our next scene?

00:12:12.458 --> 00:12:14.042
It's so hot today.

00:12:14.792 --> 00:12:16.208
Are we all set?

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:18.750
Hey, can I get something to drink?

00:12:24.917 --> 00:12:26.417
Yes, sir.

00:12:26.542 --> 00:12:27.708
Excuse me, Manager...

00:12:27.833 --> 00:12:29.333
Is something wrong with Moon Do-ha?

00:12:29.458 --> 00:12:30.833
He seems a bit off.

00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958
Oh, Do-ha?

00:12:34.042 --> 00:12:35.167
Well...

00:12:35.292 --> 00:12:40.000
Just now... he saw the news
about you and another actor...

00:12:40.125 --> 00:12:44.250
filming some kind of travel show.

00:12:44.375 --> 00:12:45.667
A travel show?

00:12:45.792 --> 00:12:50.792
"Moon Do-ha's Stuntman to Film
Travel Show with Actor Shin Jun-oh"

00:12:50.917 --> 00:12:53.375
This report has to be a mistake, right?

00:12:54.167 --> 00:12:55.875
That damn Shin Jun-oh!

00:12:58.583 --> 00:13:00.917
Report this to our boss first.

00:13:01.042 --> 00:13:03.000
Okay, I'll contact him now.

00:13:03.875 --> 00:13:05.458
Jae-yeon! Jae-yeon!

00:13:05.583 --> 00:13:06.417
I'm sorry!

00:13:06.542 --> 00:13:08.125
Moon Do-ha asked for a rehearsal.

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:10.500
I forgot to tell you.

00:13:10.625 --> 00:13:11.792
What?

00:13:12.875 --> 00:13:15.083
I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry!

00:13:15.833 --> 00:13:17.000
I'm sorry.

00:13:17.125 --> 00:13:17.917
Let's start the rehearsal.

00:13:18.042 --> 00:13:20.500
Does your team normally make actors wait?

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:23.250
I'm sorry.

00:13:23.375 --> 00:13:25.083
How busy can you possibly be?

00:13:25.208 --> 00:13:26.625
Ah.

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:29.792
Is your new person to
kiss up to more important?

00:13:33.875 --> 00:13:35.750
For the inconvenience we've caused,

00:13:35.875 --> 00:13:37.792
I sincerely apologize.

00:13:39.333 --> 00:13:40.750
For the remainder of this shoot,

00:13:40.875 --> 00:13:42.833
something like this
will never happen again.

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:46.958
No... It's not that big of a deal.

00:13:47.083 --> 00:13:48.375
I'm sorry.

00:13:50.333 --> 00:13:51.875
We're sorry.

00:13:52.375 --> 00:13:53.667
We're sorry.

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:57.208
Seriously, what's with Moon Do-ha?

00:13:57.333 --> 00:13:59.250
You've done so many shows with him.

00:13:59.375 --> 00:14:00.917
And now he's suddenly picking a fight?

00:14:01.417 --> 00:14:03.643
Anyone watching would think
we kept him waiting for ages.

00:14:03.667 --> 00:14:04.208
Honestly, what was it, five minutes?

00:14:04.333 --> 00:14:07.083
No, it wasn't even a
minute. I was watching.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.958
We were in the wrong.

00:14:10.083 --> 00:14:10.958
What else did he say?

00:14:11.083 --> 00:14:13.167
Something about... kissing up?

00:14:13.292 --> 00:14:16.372
He's the one who got all that media
attention before the shoot, thanks to you.

00:14:16.417 --> 00:14:18.250
What's he talking about?

00:14:18.792 --> 00:14:19.792
That's not it.

00:14:19.875 --> 00:14:21.042
Hey.

00:14:21.167 --> 00:14:22.500
Since it's come to this,

00:14:22.625 --> 00:14:24.625
you should just switch
over to Shin Jun-oh's team.

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:27.167
Go eat your kimbap.

00:14:28.417 --> 00:14:29.708
Yes, sir.

00:14:32.625 --> 00:14:33.833
Hmm?

00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.833
Did the director call?

00:14:36.333 --> 00:14:37.333
Hey, Jae-yeon!

00:14:37.417 --> 00:14:38.750
Think about it.

00:14:38.875 --> 00:14:40.833
This is a life-changing opportunity!

00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:42.143
This is on a whole different level.

00:14:42.167 --> 00:14:44.375
It's a travel show with Shin Jun-oh!

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:45.667
I refuse.

00:14:45.792 --> 00:14:47.042
Jae-yeon!

00:14:47.167 --> 00:14:49.042
Why would I do a show with Shin Jun-oh?

00:14:49.167 --> 00:14:50.375
We're not like that.

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.250
And I don't want to.

00:14:52.375 --> 00:14:53.667
Besides...

00:14:53.792 --> 00:14:56.042
I don't want to get mixed
up with actors anymore.

00:14:56.167 --> 00:14:58.807
I already had to grit my teeth and bear it
working with Moon Do-ha.

00:14:58.875 --> 00:15:01.208
Why are you bringing up Moon Do-ha?

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.625
Moon Do-ha and Shin Jun-oh are different.

00:15:06.208 --> 00:15:07.083
Anyway...

00:15:07.208 --> 00:15:08.042
Just forget about the show.

00:15:08.167 --> 00:15:10.667
What? What do you mean?

00:15:13.292 --> 00:15:15.375
I'll call you back later.

00:15:17.083 --> 00:15:18.667
What do you mean?

00:15:19.208 --> 00:15:21.833
This has nothing to do with Mr. Moon Do-ha.

00:15:22.292 --> 00:15:24.667
It's about Shin Jun-oh.
What's it got to do with me?

00:15:24.792 --> 00:15:26.542
Of course it does!

00:15:27.625 --> 00:15:29.292
Why?

00:15:30.125 --> 00:15:32.458
Are you afraid I'm going to
go kiss up to Mr. Shin Jun-oh?

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.667
