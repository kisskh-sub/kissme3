00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.400
Okay.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.200
Sure.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.680
Alright.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.440
This young lady is truly impressive.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.080
This...

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.480
How do we judge this?

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.640
Archery contest.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.080
Whoever leaves an arrow in the bullseye wins.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.160
Now,

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.840
no arrow remains in the bullseye.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.120
It's a draw.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.480
Princess Muya's archery is outstanding today.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.680
Truly, this was a remarkable match.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.080
But the target is damaged today.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.360
Perhaps

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.840
the princess could compete another day.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.000
You're quite skilled.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.360
Next time, I'll definitely beat you.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.040
Princess.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.040
You were gracious.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.960
You were gracious.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.000
Today's banquet

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.520
is to foster friendship between our nations.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.680
I

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.640
wish to sign a ten-year alliance with Wu Rong.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.480
Ling An is a land of talent and virtue.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.760
The monarch is young and accomplished.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.640
This journey has been enlightening for me.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.400
Since I promised my brother

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.120
to form an alliance with Ling An,

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.280
then

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.280
I must see it through.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.840
So tomorrow, the officials

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.120
will begin alliance arrangements.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.400
Today, everyone

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.120
celebrates this alliance together.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.360
Let us share in this grand era.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.120
Come.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.400
Please.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.320
I'll rest in the carriage for a bit.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:31.280
Alright.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.680
I heard from my royal brother

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.640
that Ling An's late emperor feared military generals.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.880
So, major generals' families were forbidden to have sons.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.400
Otherwise, the whole family would be exiled.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.760
Is that why you disguised yourself as a woman

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.440
and married into the Rui family to survive?

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.600
That is indeed part of the reason.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:20.560
I don't understand.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.280
You've suffered so much,

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.800
yet you still think Ling An is good?

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.240
What's wrong with me?

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.280
Aren't I doing just fine?

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.000
You weren't like this in Wu Rong.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.720
Is this really the life you want?

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:35.480
Yes.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.160
This is the life I want.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:39.480
But...

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.640
That person...

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.760
Is it Rui Yu?

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.960
Yes.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.440
Before I met her,

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.040
I thought I'd face everything alone in this life.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.600
But she was like a ray of light

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.360
shining into my small world.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.040
I love her.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.840
Only she

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.800
is the bright moon guiding me home.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.080
So, she's that important to you.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.200
Princess, let's go back.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.840
Lord Rui.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.960
Where are you headed?

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.680
I'm a bit tipsy.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:24.920
Just out for a walk.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.400
How about

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.240
I keep you company for a chat?

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:29.720
Maybe

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.240
it'll help you sober up.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.480
I'll soon return to Qian Yuan.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.920
The Rui family took in my aunt and me back then.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.760
I'll never forget this kindness.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.040
When I return to Qian Yuan,

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.520
I'll find a way to repay you.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.160
Whatever uncle wants,

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.440
I can give it to you.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.600
It was no trouble at all.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.880
No need to worry, Your Highness.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.280
Don't you want a more noble status?

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.040
Or

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.320
a partner who can truly stand beside you?

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.760
My wife and I

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.920
are very close now.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.280
No need for Your Highness to worry.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.160
The wine's effect has worn off.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.600
I should return to the banquet.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.720
I'll head back first.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.440
So, I was never in your heart.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:30.880
In your heart,

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.520
there's only that cowardly survivalist.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:49.240
Your Highness.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:53.600
Miss Ming.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.720
Are you feeling unwell, Your Highness?

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.480
Thank you, Miss Ming.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.600
I'm just a bit tired.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.960
If Your Highness is tired,

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.200
you could drink less wine.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.960
There's a dessert at the banquet that helps with sobering up.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.160
You could try it, Your Highness.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.160
If I return to Qian Yuan,

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.120
I'll need some leverage.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.680
to keep that old fox Ming Qihao in check.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.000
Your Highness.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:20.680
It's nothing.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:22.720
Miss Ming.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.320
Are you looking for someone?

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.240
I just felt stifled at the banquet.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.360
So I came out for a walk.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.400
Then...

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.480
come back with me, then.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:35.400
Alright.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.160
After you, Your Highness.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:38.280
Please.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:42.680
Where did my junior sister go?

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:43.920
She'll be back soon.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:45.720
After you, Your Highness.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:46.400
Prime Minister Ming.

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.600
Come visit our grasslands.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.200
I'll take you riding, My Queen.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.440
To the far edge of the sky.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.200
The King of Wu Rong is truly forthright.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.040
This alliance is truly a good thing.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.000
Please.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:10.640
Your Majesty

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:12.960
I have arranged this banquet

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.080
to foster friendship between Ling An
and Wu Rong

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:17.000
However,

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.120
seeing Your Majesty and King Wurong
in such good spirits,

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:20.800
I suppose

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.880
there's no need for me to say more

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.720
Prince Pan thoughtfully hosted
this banquet

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:27.400
Then I

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.320
will use this envoy banquet
to announce some news

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.760
Ling An and Wu Rong will soon
sign an alliance

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:35.880
For ten years,

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.680
Wu Rong will not invade
Ling An's border cities

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.400
Ling An will offer aid to Wu Rong
in winter

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.840
All this is thanks to Prince Pan
for mediating

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.680
so that I and King Wurong

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.640
could speak calmly and peacefully

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:50.080
Come,

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.360
I toast to you both

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:52.640
A toast to Your Majesty

00:08:59.040 --> 00:08:59.680
Your Majesty

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.400
I also have a matter

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.040
and wish to use this alliance's joy

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.760
to request Your Majesty's approval

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.000
Speak

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.280
I

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.880
wish to marry Prime Minister Ming's
daughter, Ming Wanwan

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.280
Father

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.320
Prince Pan seeks marriage

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.880
without asking the young lady's wishes

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:33.280
but instead asks Your Majesty

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.640
Is he using state affairs

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.120
to force Miss Ming to comply?

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:39.520
King Wurong

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.800
I am of Qian Yuan's royal family

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.320
Marrying a Ling An lady is for
our nations' good

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.000
Of course,

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.880
I must seek Your Majesty's consent

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.200
to show my sincerity

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.040
If that's the case,

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:56.440
I

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.080
find Miss Ming elegant and graceful

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:01.040
and wish to marry her as well

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.800
to strengthen our alliance

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.720
What does Your Majesty think?

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.200
Marriage

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.080
should be based on mutual affection

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.280
You both should put in more effort

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.200
to win Miss Ming's heart

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.360
I would gladly

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.040
see a happy union

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.160
Your Majesty is right

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.240
I was too abrupt

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.080
Miss Ming

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:26.560
please don't blame me

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.920
I did not think it through

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.080
Forgive my rudeness

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.000
Come,

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.560
let us all raise a glass together

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.440
It's getting late

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.600
Let's end here for today

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:05.600
Let us adjourn

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.320
Respectfully seeing off Your Majesty

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:21.400
Prime Minister Ming

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.480
I will depart for Wu Rong tomorrow

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.960
That young prince of Qian Yuan

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.480
you should keep an eye on him

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:37.800
I understand

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.040
Thank you

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.560
Your servant greets the Queen Mother

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.840
You are Qiao family's eldest,
Qiao Youyi

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.680
Commoner greets the Queen Mother

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.520
May the Queen Mother have
longevity and blessings

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:12.880
and peace and health

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:14.720
Rise

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.360
Take a seat

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:17.840
Thank you, Queen Mother

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.000
I've heard you

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.280
excel in martial arts

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.600
and are skilled in medicine

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.560
a clever young lady

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.440
Those are just small tricks

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:37.760
Queen Mother flatters me

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.720
I've also heard

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.880
you live on the mountain
with your master

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.040
I wonder

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:45.520
who your master is

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.360
My master is just a humble villager

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.680
not worth mentioning

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.400
Still, he saved my life

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.120
If Miss Qiao won't say,

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.280
I

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:00.320
must still accept this kindness

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:01.880
How about this

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.360
Tomorrow, take Fang Ruo
up the mountain

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:05.360
on my behalf

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.040
to return this favor

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:09.720
The mountain path is rough

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.160
I shouldn't trouble Aunt

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.440
Let me deliver it instead

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.320
Queen Mother, please don't tease
Miss Qiao

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.320
I come from a military family

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:29.560
Back then,

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.480
the Nan family

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.200
I knew them well

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:34.640
Your master

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.920
is Yu Qingxuan, right?

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:38.880
Yes

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.200
That eccentric old man

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:43.600
When he was young

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.480
he was always a loner

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:47.080
Even now,

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.400
he hides away on the mountain

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.320
But

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.840
he taught you so well

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.440
he deserves credit

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.880
I'm still not fully recovered

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.080
and you are skilled in medicine

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:03.000
Why not stay by my side

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.480
and help nurse me back to health

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.520
I grew up in the mountains

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.080
I'm afraid I might offend
the Queen Mother

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:14.920
You

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.160
don't wish to enter the palace

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.800
King Wurong and Princess Muya

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.040
have already left the country safely.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.560
Once they return home,

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:29.920
they will send the official letter.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.360
That's excellent.

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:34.160
This way, we needn't worry about Qian Yuan's intentions.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.600
This morning, Pan Zizhai

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.040
submitted a petition to marry Ming Wanwan.

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:40.000
What do you think?

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:42.240
Previously,

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.040
he asked to marry Princess Yan Luo.

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.160
The Monarch refused him.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:46.600
Now,

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.880
he seeks to marry a minister's daughter.

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.760
Is it truly for love?

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.680
I also thought

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:56.000
he was devoted to Ming Wanwan.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.120
But this morning, he submitted a petition

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.080
asking to make Ming Wanwan a Princess.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.080
She would marry into Qian Yuan after he returns.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.760
As a bond between the two nations.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.560
Pan Zizhai is a hostage in Ling An,

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.480
but he is still a prince of Qian Yuan.

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:12.720
Miss Ming is a minister's daughter,

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:14.120
but

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.760
she has already been made a Princess.

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:18.000
In both emotion and reason,

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:20.160
Ling An has no reason to refuse.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.840
But will the Queen Mother agree?

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:24.640
Miss Qiao,

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.760
do you wish to see the Monarch?

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.640
No need, just escort me out of the palace.

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:29.760
But

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000
the Monarch...

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:32.520
Then I

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.320
will take my leave.

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:35.200
Go ahead.

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.560
Did the Queen Mother trouble you?

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:19.200
No.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:23.440
Is it the palace that makes you

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:24.520
feel a bit constrained?

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.160
No.

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.880
It's just my first time wearing something so elaborate.

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.080
I'm not used to it.

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.080
You can wear whatever you like.

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:33.680
Wouldn't that break the rules?

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:34.600
Of course not.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.440
I set all the rules.

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.880
I've just never seen you in such clothes.

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.200
On a whim,

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.840
I had someone make an outfit for you.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.760
If you don't like it, don't wear it.

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:47.920
Since it's your intention,

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.560
I will treasure it.

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:53.680
That day,

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.000
I saw you with Princess Muya of Wu Rong

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:57.520
competing together.

00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.400
You seemed to shine.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.480
So dazzling.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.360
I'm not a candle,

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:03.400
how could I shine?

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:05.640
That's not what I meant.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:06.480
I mean,

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.560
I understand.

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:08.720
Just teasing you.

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.560
That day, you turned the tide at the envoy banquet.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.080
Do you want any reward?

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.680
It's my duty as a citizen of Ling An.

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:23.080
I don't need any reward.

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.000
Then,

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.280
would you

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:32.800
become my Queen?

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.080
I am not willing.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.320
Do you have someone you love?

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:43.280
Aren't you just playing dumb?

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:45.960
The one I love,

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.720
our statuses are worlds apart.

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:51.720
I always try to get closer to him,

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:53.880
but every time I try,

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.520
I find an unbridgeable chasm between us.

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:06.320
I'm used to being free and easy.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.040
Life in the palace

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:09.280
is not my world.

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:11.200
It would bring much trouble.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.000
Don't worry.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.360
I will protect you.

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.520
This isn't just about our wishes.

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:17.840
In your position,

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.720
you must think of all the people.

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:23.400
I don't want you to balance everything for me.

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.960
If one day you grow weary,

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:27.840
I would become the culprit.

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:31.040
In this life,

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.320
I will always be Miss Qiao.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.320
But the person here

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:39.960
cannot be Young Master Lin.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:42.680
We

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:44.880
should part ways here.

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:09.480
What's wrong?

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:12.760
Urgent report, Monarch: danger in Pingxiang.

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:29.880
I have acted improperly.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.360
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.600
Just have someone replace it.

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:35.800
Rise.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.080
Miss Qiao,

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.040
have you returned to the woods again?

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:52.120
Perhaps.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:01.800
The Queen Mother actually wants Miss Qiao to become a consort.

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.160
How about

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.200
I try persuading her again?

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:06.560
No need.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.800
If two people truly love each other,

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.440
it's better to let her be free.

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.120
But if your beloved can't stay by your side,

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:16.720
won't you feel regret, Your Majesty?

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:25.280
I always thought

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:27.840
royal marriages

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.200
were just for political balance.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.760
Until I met Miss Qiao,

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:35.200
I finally became myself.

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:37.520
Why do you tell me this, Your Majesty?

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.000
I have no intention toward you.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.440
Nor do I wish to hold you back.

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:44.520
But I...

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:47.480
Your Majesty,

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:49.800
An urgent secret letter from Pingxiang.

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:56.480
You may leave.

00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:59.080
I take my leave.

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.600
Hou Qi has actually seized military power.

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.440
Now only Duke Fushan

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:15.320
is holding Pingxiang Palace with his guards.

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:17.480
My people risked their lives

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.040
just to get this message out.

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.920
There is an alliance between our nations.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.920
If Ling An doesn't send troops to help,

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.840
it will surely give other nations cause to talk.

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:28.920
But if, at this moment,

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.640
other nations attack Ling An,

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:33.520
the capital's defense can't be maintained.

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.200
In other words,

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:37.880
our forces are stretched thin.

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:41.400
And the biggest problem is,

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.000
if Hou Qi ascends the throne,

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.480
he will surely attack Ling An.

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.800
It's a vicious cycle we can't escape.

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:48.080
This battle

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:49.760
seems inevitable now.

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:50.520
For now,

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.200
the Monarch keeps this secret.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:55.960
We must quickly come up with a plan.

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:01.240
Ling An, as the leader of the five nations,

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:02.680
must take the lead.

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:05.560
But there will surely be danger.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.440
I trust Young Master Nan.

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:13.120
If only General of the Cloud Banner were here.

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:14.720
He could win against the odds.

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:19.760
You should read fewer storybooks.

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.320
What are you thinking about?

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.200
When two close friends

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.080
face hardship,

00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:59.760
yet you can't do anything to help,

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:04.360
it feels powerless.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:08.600
Isn't this

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.240
just like our nation's plight now?

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.120
What the Princess said

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:18.080
was a joke,

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:19.720
but not wrong.

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.520
What Ling An lacks now

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:25.680
is a great general.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:36.880
Do you want to go?

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:40.680
Of course I do.

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.560
But even if I regained my status

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.240
as a Nan family son,

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:52.120
how could I get the chance to fight?

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.400
If you could go,

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:57.520
you'd face extreme danger.

00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:59.280
You might even lose your life.

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:00.960
Would you still

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:02.840
go?

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:11.680
If I had the chance,

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.800
I would choose to go to war.

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:23.200
Yu'er,

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:23.840
I...

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:24.840
I understand.

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:27.440
Go to sleep.

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.160
The Nan family knows Pingxiang's battlefield best.

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:08.640
This matter

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:10.720
should be handled by the Nan family.

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.040
But the only one I've wronged

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:16.200
is you.

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:43.320
Knowing the road ahead is perilous,

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:47.040
I can't selfishly keep you for myself.

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:49.680
Since

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:52.680
you have the determination to die,

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.160
then I must fight for you too.

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:23.880
Prime Minister Ming.

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:24.720
Ying Shu.

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:30.280
Prime Minister Ming.

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.200
Coming to see me so openly,

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:35.400
aren't you afraid of suspicion?

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.080
That you have ulterior motives?

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:40.760
You proposed to my daughter at the envoy's banquet.

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:42.800
Why can't I meet my future son-in-law?

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:44.000
What's wrong with that?

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:45.600
So,

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:48.160
even though King Wurong interfered before,

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.240
Prime Minister Ming,

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:51.440
you still agreed to my proposal.

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:52.840
Don't underestimate him.

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:55.760
King Wurong is not to be taken lightly.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:57.800
Of course.

00:27:58.320 --> 00:27:59.880
As for your proposal,

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:01.920
it depends on the prince's

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:03.960
sincerity.

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:06.720
What will you offer as a betrothal gift?

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.240
I've already sent people

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.120
to gather evidence in Wu Rong.

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:12.400
Now I can prove

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:15.600
the Young Master Beicheng Wu Rong seeks

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:17.840
is Nan Chenxiao.

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:24.080
You mean Nan Chenxiao

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:26.680
is disguised as a woman?

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:27.480
Exactly.

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:37.920
Is there something you need, sir?

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:40.560
Nothing.

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:41.920
Where's Liang Jin?

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.120
Miss Liang Jin

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:44.400
just went to the front yard.

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:45.840
She hasn't returned yet.

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:05.960
Come in.

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:11.000
Did Chenxiao return to the General's Mansion?

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:11.640
Yes.

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:14.560
The mansion's steward said madam won't return tonight.

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:15.760
Did something happen at the mansion?

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:16.960
He didn't say.

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:19.160
Just that the old madam misses her daughter.

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:23.920
It's been a long time

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.080
since she visited her parents.

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:28.280
Tomorrow after work,

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:30.200
I'll go to the mansion and bring her back.

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:34.440
What's wrong?

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:36.160
I'm happy for you and madam.

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:38.720
What's there to be happy about?

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.240
You don't know yet,

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:42.920
but you're now the model husband in the capital.

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:45.440
Everyone's learning from you to care for their wives.

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:48.400
But who would have thought you are actually—

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:49.720
You...

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:53.000
Go, go, just go back!

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.320
Why are you so talkative now?

00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:58.760
Go do your work.

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:00.120
Yes, yes, yes.

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.400
Sir, rest well.

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:02.360
Have a good dream.

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:00.720
I was a step too late.

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:04.880
I still wanted to tell you

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:13.240
that tomorrow

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:18.600
I can finally stand proudly by your side.
