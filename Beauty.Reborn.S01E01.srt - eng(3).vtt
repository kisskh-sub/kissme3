00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.760
-Oh my.
-Argh!

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.840
What do I do? I don't know what to do!

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.960
-So much blood…
-Help!

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.840
-Hey!
-Argh!

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.920
-Blood…
-Ah.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:27.840
What happened here?

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.280
Hang in there. Just now,

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.480
the air-con technician
was fixing the unit,

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.120
and he fell onto the glass table.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.960
It shattered and cut his arm, Mr. Din.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.640
Have you called an ambulance?

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.280
Yes, but it hasn't arrived yet.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.200
The traffic's terrible at this hour.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.440
Anybody,

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.960
get me clean gauze and alcohol.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.920
{\an8}From our discussion,
I think you'd be a great fit

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.840
for our company as a cosmetic scientist.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.600
Thank you so much.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.880
What about the benefits, overtime pay,

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.880
and the allowance for housing
near the company that I requested?

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.400
Oh, that shouldn't be a problem at all.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.480
Does that mean I got the job?

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.200
You still need to have a final interview
with our CEO this afternoon.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.800
Oh, okay.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.440
Thank you very much.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.440
Okay, go.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.200
Wow.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.920
If it wasn't for you, Mr. Din,
he would've lost all his blood by now.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.160
-He's amazing, right?
-Yeah.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.160
It's not that big of a deal.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.280
Mr. Din, your shirt's all stained.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.680
Let me grab you a new one to change into.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.800
Thanks, Uncle Perm.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.120
{\an8}‎OUT OF ORDER

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.320
{\an8}The restroom's out of order?

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.760
That's okay.
I can use another one upstairs.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.840
No need, Mr. Din. Why waste your time?

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.520
You can just change in the ladies' room.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.480
I'll hang this "Out of Order" sign

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.440
on the ladies' room's door.
Problem solved.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.760
Alright then.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.760
Please, go ahead.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.920
Let me borrow this, boys.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.440
{\an8}OUT OF ORDER

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.760
{\an8}All done.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.640
{\an8}Huh? Who messed with this?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.080
Uncle Perm?

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.000
-You pervert!
-Wait, wait.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.680
Please, calm down. Listen to me first.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.320
I'm not a pervert.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:47.920
Not a pervert?

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.920
Then why are you in the women's restroom?

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.960
So, because--

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.080
You disgusting freak!
You lowlife! You creep! Take this!

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.280
Help! Somebody help me!

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.600
What the hell?

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.600
Wait! What's happening? Stop!

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.040
Wait! Calm down!

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.680
Sir, please help me!

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.640
This pervert
sneaked into the ladies' room.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.320
He was definitely planning
to do something bad!

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.000
Please call the police
and have him arrested!

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.560
Whoa, whoa, calm down.
Mr. Din, are you okay?

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.240
Get up.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.240
He's not a pervert.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.800
He's our CEO!

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.800
That's right.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.520
I'm screwed…

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.600
Come on, Uncle Perm.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.360
I'm the one who got hurt here.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.200
Well, I got carried away, you know?

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.840
Watching her punch you again and again…

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.720
I could almost feel it myself!

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.240
She must've really packed a punch.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.760
-Don't let me see you again…
-Huh?

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.480
Oh, I think it's the candidate

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.480
who came
for the cosmetic scientist interview.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.360
-Send them in.
-Yes, sir.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.320
You may come in.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:38.760
Huh?

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.480
Hello.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.080
Hello.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.360
Hello.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.480
I'm Sara. Please call me Sarah.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:05.480
Have a seat.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.800
I'm Pathawee, CEO of this company.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:39.240
I'm curious.
Is this some kind of new interview trend?

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.680
Well… It's just that

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.640
the PM2.5 dust levels
are really high lately.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.880
It can cause lung cancer
and eye irritation.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.800
Plus, COVID's still around.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.200
For both our health and safety,

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.240
I just wanted to take extra precautions.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.240
Okay.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.440
{\an8}So, if I wanted a whitening product,
which active ingredients would you choose?

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.040
{\an8}Vitamin B and vitamin C.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.120
The essentials. We can't leave them out.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:16.440
{\an8}And I might also add
hydroxy, glutathione, and glabridin.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.720
{\an8}But it really depends on the formula.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.800
Do I look familiar to you?

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.760
No, not at all.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.000
But…

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:40.039
I don't think that has anything to do
with this interview, right?

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.120
Oh, it does.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.320
We need to settle that matter

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.080
before we can continue.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.040
You think I'm stupid?

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.560
After what you did to me today,

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.560
I could file
an attempted murder charge against you.

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.960
What? I was just defending myself!

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.440
I thought you were some kind of pervert!

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.280
Hey! Hey, don't run away!

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.040
If you press charges against me,
I'll press charges right back at you.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:25.240
What happened, Mr. Din?
Should I call security?

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.640
No need.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.200
{\an8}I even booked a Grab Premium
because I was scared I'd be late,

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.760
{\an8}and I still had to go through
all that nonsense!

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.320
Just my luck.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.680
Hello, sis?

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:55.560
Hello?

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.200
Did you get the job?

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.520
Yeah, I got it.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.680
Seriously?

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.240
You actually got the job?

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.480
No, a jail sentence, maybe.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.120
I literally beat up their CEO today.
Like I'll get the job.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.800
Oh my…

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.200
You're that desperate for money

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.440
and you still picked a fight with him?

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:16.320
What happened, Sarah?

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.240
PD GROUP - BEAUTY BEGINS WITH CARE
PATHAWEE PHIMARNDECH

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.120
Talk to you later, okay?

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.800
Wait. Hello? Sarah?

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.360
Pathawee…

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.000
Phimarndech?

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:38.840
Din?

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.640
Is that you, Din?

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.040
Is it okay now, Dad?

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.640
That's enough.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.280
Thank you.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.400
Hi, sis.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.760
Dad.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.720
How are you feeling? Are you okay?

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.400
Much better.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:19.720
The doctor said I can recover at home now.

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.600
Once you get the heart transplant,

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.120
you'll be back to normal in no time.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.320
But the expenses are so high.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:30.880
Sara,

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.160
you still haven't found a job yet.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.680
Don't worry about that, Dad.

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:41.760
Who am I here?

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.200
A U.S. scholarship graduate

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.240
with a degree in cosmetic science.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.040
Getting a job will be a breeze.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.240
I just don't want to be a burden to you.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.520
Honestly, I could skip the surgery.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.000
No, Dad.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.400
If you don't have it,
you'll keep feeling sick like this

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.840
and not getting better.

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:10.960
He's right.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.960
Don't overthink it, okay? Please?

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:16.960
Alright.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.560
I already transferred the money.

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:34.160
Use it to pay for Dad's treatment
so he can be discharged.

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:41.040
Don't worry, I'll find a way
to cover all his medical costs.

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.640
SAVINGS ACCOUNT: 25,706.65 THB

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.480
That's all the money I have left?

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:00.640
Sarah!

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.160
Sara!

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:06.640
Sarah!

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.480
PD Group, the one you interviewed with,
just called me!

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:13.440
Huh? Why'd they call you and not me?

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.440
Because they couldn't reach you.

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.680
You listed my number
as your reference, remember?

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.160
They're that desperate to reach me?

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.120
Are they trying to throw me in jail?

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.080
Fine. Bring it on. I did nothing wrong.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.440
They're not throwing you in jail.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.120
They want you to work for them!

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.680
What? Work?!

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:37.240
Yep, you got the job!

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.440
The reason I hired you is because

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.120
your profile was stronger
than any of the other candidates.

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.640
More importantly,
we really need people right now.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.160
Oh my God.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.800
Hey, are you messing with me?

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:17.840
Also, I know how to let things go.

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:19.920
I don't hold grudges, like…

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:21.600
Like who?

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.360
Who else? Someone so cautious now.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:28.520
She probably thinks I brought her here
to do something inappropriate.

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:33.960
Anyway, you're my employee now.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.880
Show me what you've got.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.960
But if you can't deliver

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.800
and there's no new product
coming out soon,

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.880
you'd better be ready to pack your things.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.440
I think that's a really good approach.

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:53.440
It'll motivate the staff
to be more proactive.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.080
Great job.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.000
You…

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.240
What time does work start here?

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:44.120
It's already ten,
and no one's shown up yet.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Everyone's already here.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.080
What?

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.840
You're here,
so that means the department's complete.

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:56.560
What do you mean?

00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:01.040
You're the only one in this department.
Who else would you be waiting for?

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.440
Are we really losing that much money?

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:44.560
Has Mr. Apo come in yet?

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.880
Not yet, sir.

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:34.920
DIN

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:36.560
Hello, Din.

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.080
Good thing you still picked up.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.920
Where the hell are you?

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.880
Get your ass to the office right now.
There are papers you need to sign.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.240
Can I just sign and run?
If not, I'm not going.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.800
You're not working,
and you talk like that?

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.240
Who says I'm not working?

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:55.360
Streaming games, posting content, TikToks.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.440
That's all work. It earns money too.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.520
Not enough for your lifestyle.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:03.800
You're surviving on your salary
from this company, aren't you?

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:10.800
Nam, you know the company's in trouble.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:13.000
Why don't you try helping out a bit?

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:17.320
Then just sell it if it's such a mess.
Why are you forcing me to be part of it?

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:19.840
Because it's Dad's company.

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:21.920
Yes, things are bad now,
but if we hang in there,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.880
it'll bounce back eventually.

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:29.320
Nam, help me out, please.

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.600
Ugh, sorry, bro,
I've got another call. Talk later!

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.440
Nam?

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:10.960
Why hasn't this company
launched any new products in years?

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:22.760
Excuse me.

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:28.360
Does the company have financial problems?

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.200
It's your first day here.

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:35.080
Don't you think
that's an inappropriate question?

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:40.160
Maybe in terms of appropriateness, yes.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:45.120
But in terms of necessity, I need to ask,

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.680
and I have the right to.

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:51.600
I just want to know
how stable the company I work for is.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:53.200
That way, I can plan my work properly.

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.600
And if I plan things well,

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.160
the company will benefit, right?

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:05.360
But there's no problem with our finances.

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.160
Now, get back to work.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:11.120
But it's been years

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.360
since your last product launch.

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:16.240
That means you don't have
the budget for R&D, right?

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:24.400
I know I'm annoying you,
but I want the truth.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.320
The truth is,

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:33.240
you're in product development,
not management.

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.680
So, don't do things that aren't your job.

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:42.920
But knowing the truth is part of my job.

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.520
Just tell me, please.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.200
Are you planning to keep hugging me?

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.760
Hello? Is the power out?

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:32.160
I'm stuck in the elevator.
Send someone to help me.

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.360
Hey. Are you okay?

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:38.480
I…

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.600
I'm claustrophobic.

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:47.600
Calm down.

00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:58.360
{\an8}Oh, Uncle Perm.

00:21:58.440 --> 00:21:59.920
-Hello.
-Hello, sir.

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.440
You must be here
to sign some papers, Mr. Nam.

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:06.760
The power's out, everyone's chaotic, but
the documents are ready. I'll go get them.

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:09.640
Oh, Miss Baicha.
Are you here to see Mr. Din?

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:12.000
Oh-la-la!

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:16.960
Is there anyone who doesn't know this?

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:18.880
Shut up.

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:35.800
Just hang in there.
Someone will come soon.

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:42.960
It's too hot… I can't breathe…

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.040
Hey. Try to calm down.

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.480
Easy.

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:53.520
Take slow breaths, okay?

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:00.040
Ah! Power's back.

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:03.960
Alright, let's go find Din, shall we?

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:07.840
Maybe now,
someone can stop looking for him.

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:10.080
Nam, you talk way too much!

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:15.840
So cute, though.

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:17.760
Easy now.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.280
You're drenched in sweat.

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:33.280
Hey.

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:35.560
The elevator's open.

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:39.520
Slowly.

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:41.480
Okay…

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:05.480
Hey!

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:30.840
Let me help.

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:34.440
Careful now.

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:55.160
How are you feeling?

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:57.200
Feeling better?

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.400
Much better now.

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:05.360
Thank you so much.

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.960
Well…

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:13.360
It's already past my work hours,
so I should get going.

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:15.600
I'll walk you out.

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:21.280
It's okay. I feel fine now.

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:23.080
Better safe than sorry.

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:24.600
You just recovered.

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:28.240
What if you take the elevator alone
and it gets stuck again?

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:34.840
Okay, thank you.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.640
{\an8}Do you like taking photos, Ms. Sarah?

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:02.320
{\an8}Why do you ask?

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:04.040
{\an8}I'm actually a photographer,

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:07.040
and I've been looking for some new faces
to add to my portfolio.

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:10.840
Sounds interesting.

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:15.920
If you're up for it,
could I get your contact?

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.600
We don't even know each other yet.

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:26.120
Sorry, I'm not comfortable
giving my contact info to a stranger.

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:32.280
I'm Apo Phimarndech,
but you can call me Nam.

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.120
{\an8}Nice to meet you.

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:08.520
NAM IS SO CUTE. NICE TEETH, PRETTY EYES…

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.760
Hey, give it back!

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:20.920
-Give it back!
-Nah, not a chance!

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.120
Give it!

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.760
-"Nam is so cute. Nice teeth."
-Give it back!

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:27.320
-"Pretty eyes."
-Give it back!

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.640
-Give it back!
-Does Sara have a crush on Nam?

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:31.920
-Give it!
-You pimple-faced, thick-browed!

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.680
Dog tick on your chin!

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:36.760
-Give it back!
-You pimple-faced, thick-browed!

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:38.280
Dog tick on your chin!

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:40.040
Be a couple!

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:41.960
-Be a couple!
-Give it back!

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:43.800
-Give it back!
-Be a couple!

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:45.480
Cut it out.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:49.480
Who'd ever date such an ugly girl?

00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:58.640
Unrequited love!

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.280
Give it back!

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:35.640
Well, now we do know each other.

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:38.320
So? Can I have your number now?

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:44.480
{\an8}My ride's here.

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:46.920
I should go.

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:52.560
Boyfriend's picking you up?

00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:57.360
Did you book the ride?

00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:58.880
Yes, that's me.

00:28:58.960 --> 00:28:59.840
Please.

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.280
What a relief.

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:36.640
Din, what are you doing sitting here?

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:38.800
Where did you go?

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:44.400
After I saw Ms. Sarah out,
I just wandered around. You know me.

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:49.680
But tonight, I'm in a good mood.

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:51.760
I met a girl right up my alley.

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:54.640
You mean Ms. Sarah?

00:29:58.520 --> 00:29:59.880
Let me give you a little warning.

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:04.080
That woman just started today.

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:05.520
Don't get handsy with her.

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:07.320
I wasn't.

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:09.120
Just flirting.

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:13.160
She's our employee. And you,

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:16.600
you're part of the owning family.
Don't do anything inappropriate.

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:17.960
Oh, come on, Din!

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:21.120
What century are you living in?
Why are you still talking about "status"?

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:22.320
What,

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:25.720
a company owner
can't date his own employee?

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:27.640
Which law says that?

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:29.160
Listen.

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:31.640
Hey, Nam.

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:55.800
She's still not at work?

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:04.160
-This is for you.
-Thank you.

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.400
Not you, Auntie.

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.560
-That's for me, isn't it?
-No, it's not.

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:11.480
Smells lovely! Thank you so much.

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:14.080
You're handsome and kind.

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:15.200
Yeah…

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:16.680
-I'd better get back to work.
-Sure.

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:26.840
Why is she still not at work?

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:34.760
You dragged me
all the way out of town this early

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:36.640
just to look at flowers?

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:40.640
These flowers are used
to make extracts for our cosmetics.

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:44.840
I know that.
But my job's a cosmetic scientist

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:46.680
who research and develop products.

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:50.680
Don't tell me collecting flowers
is part of my duties now.

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:53.040
It's company policy.

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:57.040
We need to know
where our raw materials come from,

00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:59.560
what their standards are,
and how their quality is controlled.

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:02.640
Still, you didn't have
to bring me along, did you?

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:03.600
I did.

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:06.600
Because you're the one
who uses these extracts.

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:09.120
Yeah, but I use the extracted ingredients,

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:12.120
not the flowers themselves.

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:14.400
Whatever.

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:17.640
You're here now, so make yourself useful.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.360
Hey, wait.

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:48.240
Sneezing, trouble breathing,

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.640
rash, red eyes…

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:01.680
Come here.

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:06.200
Hey…

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:36.880
Why'd you push me?

00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:40.560
You're allergic to the pollen.

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:44.400
Stay back. I'll handle the rest myself.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.880
Go take some antihistamines.

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:55.440
I don't want to be the reason
you pass out on me.

00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:00.280
It's fine. I can handle it.

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:01.680
I still have work to do.

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:04.160
Work isn't more important than your life.

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:06.280
About the ingredients,

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.400
just leave it to me.

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:23.000
The ingredients here
are reasonably priced,

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:26.760
but there's still a lot more to review.
I don't want to sacrifice quality.

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:29.120
But we need to find a cheaper supplier.

00:34:30.719 --> 00:34:32.280
Right. Thanks.

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.440
How are you feeling now?

00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:42.840
I'll be fine in a bit.

00:34:48.199 --> 00:34:52.199
Did you get everything sorted?

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:55.520
Actually…

00:34:56.639 --> 00:34:59.880
I've already prepared everything
for developing new products

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:03.480
and improving the old ones,
since yesterday, in fact.

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:07.400
And all within
the company's production budget.

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:11.840
How did you know what kind of ingredients
our company uses or what they cost?

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:15.480
When people take their work seriously,
there's something called research.

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:18.480
We have to understand
what the company has and uses.

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:20.800
Otherwise,
how can we move forward together?

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:25.320
Well, let's just hope
we make it all the way together.

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.640
I have one question.

00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:38.240
If you don't like it,

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:41.120
please don't just drop me halfway, okay?

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:45.200
Go ahead. I'll think about it.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.360
Same question as before.

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:49.920
What's the company's situation right now?

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:51.960
You're stubborn.

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:56.520
A good solution starts with
understanding the real problem.

00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:59.360
If I try to fix things
without knowing what's going on,

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:02.800
it's like you're making me run a marathon
without showing me

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:04.480
where the finish line is.

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:10.240
In this economy,
no one sees any finish line.

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:16.720
What matters is
how we manage to stay in the game.

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:42.240
What did you just send me?

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:46.760
It's a list of farms, factories,

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:49.120
and companies that produce

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:51.800
high-quality base nourishing ingredients

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:53.360
at lower costs.

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:56.680
You were listening to my business talk?

00:36:58.240 --> 00:36:59.200
Really paid attention, huh?

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:03.840
If you're gonna say I'm nosy,

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:06.160
just say it.

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:13.560
Well, I did
a lot of research back in school,

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:16.520
looking up suppliers, local enterprises,

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:19.120
and manufacturers both here

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:21.240
and overseas.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.480
You didn't have to send me all that.

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:27.840
People keep their connections
to themselves.

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:30.600
Not me.

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:35.000
I work for you now,
so I'll give it my all.

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:40.920
Honestly,
I just don't feel like job-hunting again.

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:53.520
-Oh, wait--
-Don't move.

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:16.560
You could've just told me.

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:17.960
Why would I?

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:21.560
Just stay still so I can get it.

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:53.040
Don't move.

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:09.760
Thank you, Din.

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:24.320
Hey, I just got some supplier info.
Can you check it for me?

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:27.040
Okay.

00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:29.600
You've been a show-off
since you were a kid, huh?

00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:32.160
Din.

00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:02.240
{\an8}Why does he hate
the Phimarndech family so much?

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:04.440
{\an8}Just one person.

00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:06.240
{\an8}If he were committed to me,

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:08.680
{\an8}I'd be ready to give everything up.

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:11.840
{\an8}Be careful,
or you'll lose Nam to someone else.

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:13.160
{\an8}If you won't fire that girl,

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:17.480
{\an8}then make sure Nam breaks up with her
and marries Nina as soon as possible.

00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:19.320
{\an8}Hey, watch out!

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:22.680
{\an8}Din.

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:33.520
